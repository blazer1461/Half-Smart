MOST
of
the
adventures
recorded
in
this
book
really
occurred;
one
or
two
were
experiences
of
my
own,
the
rest
those
of
boys
who
were
schoolmates
of
mine.
Huck
Finn
is
drawn
from
life;
Tom
Sawyer
also,
but
not
from
an
individual--he
is
a
combination
of
the
characteristics
of
three
boys
whom
I
knew,
and
therefore
belongs
to
the
composite
order
of
architecture.
The
odd
superstitions
touched
upon
were
all
prevalent
among
children
and
slaves
in
the
West
at
the
period
of
this
story--that
is
to
say,
thirty
or
forty
years
ago.
Although
my
book
is
intended
mainly
for
the
entertainment
of
boys
and
girls,
I
hope
it
will
not
be
shunned
by
men
and
women
on
that
account,
for
part
of
my
plan
has
been
to
try
to
pleasantly
remind
adults
of
what
they
once
were
themselves,
and
of
how
they
felt
and
thought
and
talked,
and
what
queer
enterprises
they
sometimes
engaged
in.

CHAPTER
I
"TOM!"
No
answer.
"TOM!"
No
answer.
"What's
gone
with
that
boy,
I
wonder?
You
TOM!"
No
answer.
The
old
lady
pulled
her
spectacles
down
and
looked
over
them
about
the
room;
then
she
put
them
up
and
looked
out
under
them.
She
seldom
or
never
looked
THROUGH
them
for
so
small
a
thing
as
a
boy;
they
were
her
state
pair,
the
pride
of
her
heart,
and
were
built
for
"style,"
not
service--she
could
have
seen
through
a
pair
of
stove-lids
just
as
well.
She
looked
perplexed
for
a
moment,
and
then
said,
not
fiercely,
but
still
loud
enough
for
the
furniture
to
hear:
"Well,
I
lay
if
I
get
hold
of
you
I'll--"
She
did
not
finish,
for
by
this
time
she
was
bending
down
and
punching
under
the
bed
with
the
broom,
and
so
she
needed
breath
to
punctuate
the
punches
with.
She
resurrected
nothing
but
the
cat.
"I
never
did
see
the
beat
of
that
boy!"
She
went
to
the
open
door
and
stood
in
it
and
looked
out
among
the
tomato
vines
and
"jimpson"
weeds
that
constituted
the
garden.
No
Tom.
So
she
lifted
up
her
voice
at
an
angle
calculated
for
distance
and
shouted:
"Y-o-u-u
TOM!"
There
was
a
slight
noise
behind
her
and
she
turned
just
in
time
to
seize
a
small
boy
by
the
slack
of
his
roundabout
and
arrest
his
flight.
"There!
I
might
'a'
thought
of
that
closet.
What
you
been
doing
in
there?"
"Nothing."
"Nothing!
Look
at
your
hands.
And
look
at
your
mouth.
What
IS
that
truck?"
"I
don't
know,
aunt."
"Well,
I
know.
It's
jam--that's
what
it
is.
Forty
times
I've
said
if
you
didn't
let
that
jam
alone
I'd
skin
you.
Hand
me
that
switch."
The
switch
hovered
in
the
air--the
peril
was
desperate--
"My!
Look
behind
you,
aunt!"
The
old
lady
whirled
round,
and
snatched
her
skirts
out
of
danger.
The
lad
fled
on
the
instant,
scrambled
up
the
high
board-fence,
and
disappeared
over
it.
His
aunt
Polly
stood
surprised
a
moment,
and
then
broke
into
a
gentle
laugh.
"Hang
the
boy,
can't
I
never
learn
anything?
Ain't
he
played
me
tricks
enough
like
that
for
me
to
be
looking
out
for
him
by
this
time?
But
old
fools
is
the
biggest
fools
there
is.
Can't
learn
an
old
dog
new
tricks,
as
the
saying
is.
But
my
goodness,
he
never
plays
them
alike,
two
days,
and
how
is
a
body
to
know
what's
coming?
He
'pears
to
know
just
how
long
he
can
torment
me
before
I
get
my
dander
up,
and
he
knows
if
he
can
make
out
to
put
me
off
for
a
minute
or
make
me
laugh,
it's
all
down
again
and
I
can't
hit
him
a
lick.
I
ain't
doing
my
duty
by
that
boy,
and
that's
the
Lord's
truth,
goodness
knows.
Spare
the
rod
and
spile
the
child,
as
the
Good
Book
says.
I'm
a
laying
up
sin
and
suffering
for
us
both,
I
know.
He's
full
of
the
Old
Scratch,
but
laws-a-me!
he's
my
own
dead
sister's
boy,
poor
thing,
and
I
ain't
got
the
heart
to
lash
him,
somehow.
Every
time
I
let
him
off,
my
conscience
does
hurt
me
so,
and
every
time
I
hit
him
my
old
heart
most
breaks.
Well-a-well,
man
that
is
born
of
woman
is
of
few
days
and
full
of
trouble,
as
the
Scripture
says,
and
I
reckon
it's
so.
He'll
play
hookey
this
evening,
*
and
[*
Southwestern
for
"afternoon"]
I'll
just
be
obleeged
to
make
him
work,
to-morrow,
to
punish
him.
It's
mighty
hard
to
make
him
work
Saturdays,
when
all
the
boys
is
having
holiday,
but
he
hates
work
more
than
he
hates
anything
else,
and
I've
GOT
to
do
some
of
my
duty
by
him,
or
I'll
be
the
ruination
of
the
child."
Tom
did
play
hookey,
and
he
had
a
very
good
time.
He
got
back
home
barely
in
season
to
help
Jim,
the
small
colored
boy,
saw
next-day's
wood
and
split
the
kindlings
before
supper--at
least
he
was
there
in
time
to
tell
his
adventures
to
Jim
while
Jim
did
three-fourths
of
the
work.
Tom's
younger
brother
(or
rather
half-brother)
Sid
was
already
through
with
his
part
of
the
work
(picking
up
chips),
for
he
was
a
quiet
boy,
and
had
no
adventurous,
troublesome
ways.
While
Tom
was
eating
his
supper,
and
stealing
sugar
as
opportunity
offered,
Aunt
Polly
asked
him
questions
that
were
full
of
guile,
and
very
deep--for
she
wanted
to
trap
him
into
damaging
revealments.
Like
many
other
simple-hearted
souls,
it
was
her
pet
vanity
to
believe
she
was
endowed
with
a
talent
for
dark
and
mysterious
diplomacy,
and
she
loved
to
contemplate
her
most
transparent
devices
as
marvels
of
low
cunning.
Said
she:
"Tom,
it
was
middling
warm
in
school,
warn't
it?"
"Yes'm."
"Powerful
warm,
warn't
it?"
"Yes'm."
"Didn't
you
want
to
go
in
a-swimming,
Tom?"
A
bit
of
a
scare
shot
through
Tom--a
touch
of
uncomfortable
suspicion.
He
searched
Aunt
Polly's
face,
but
it
told
him
nothing.
So
he
said:
"No'm--well,
not
very
much."
The
old
lady
reached
out
her
hand
and
felt
Tom's
shirt,
and
said:
"But
you
ain't
too
warm
now,
though."
And
it
flattered
her
to
reflect
that
she
had
discovered
that
the
shirt
was
dry
without
anybody
knowing
that
that
was
what
she
had
in
her
mind.
But
in
spite
of
her,
Tom
knew
where
the
wind
lay,
now.
So
he
forestalled
what
might
be
the
next
move:
"Some
of
us
pumped
on
our
heads--mine's
damp
yet.
See?"
Aunt
Polly
was
vexed
to
think
she
had
overlooked
that
bit
of
circumstantial
evidence,
and
missed
a
trick.
Then
she
had
a
new
inspiration:
"Tom,
you
didn't
have
to
undo
your
shirt
collar
where
I
sewed
it,
to
pump
on
your
head,
did
you?
Unbutton
your
jacket!"
The
trouble
vanished
out
of
Tom's
face.
He
opened
his
jacket.
His
shirt
collar
was
securely
sewed.
"Bother!
Well,
go
'long
with
you.
I'd
made
sure
you'd
played
hookey
and
been
a-swimming.
But
I
forgive
ye,
Tom.
I
reckon
you're
a
kind
of
a
singed
cat,
as
the
saying
is--better'n
you
look.
THIS
time."
She
was
half
sorry
her
sagacity
had
miscarried,
and
half
glad
that
Tom
had
stumbled
into
obedient
conduct
for
once.
But
Sidney
said:
"Well,
now,
if
I
didn't
think
you
sewed
his
collar
with
white
thread,
but
it's
black."
"Why,
I
did
sew
it
with
white!
Tom!"
But
Tom
did
not
wait
for
the
rest.
As
he
went
out
at
the
door
he
said:
"Siddy,
I'll
lick
you
for
that."
In
a
safe
place
Tom
examined
two
large
needles
which
were
thrust
into
the
lapels
of
his
jacket,
and
had
thread
bound
about
them--one
needle
carried
white
thread
and
the
other
black.
He
said:
"She'd
never
noticed
if
it
hadn't
been
for
Sid.
Confound
it!
sometimes
she
sews
it
with
white,
and
sometimes
she
sews
it
with
black.
I
wish
to
geeminy
she'd
stick
to
one
or
t'other--I
can't
keep
the
run
of
'em.
But
I
bet
you
I'll
lam
Sid
for
that.
I'll
learn
him!"
He
was
not
the
Model
Boy
of
the
village.
He
knew
the
model
boy
very
well
though--and
loathed
him.
Within
two
minutes,
or
even
less,
he
had
forgotten
all
his
troubles.
Not
because
his
troubles
were
one
whit
less
heavy
and
bitter
to
him
than
a
man's
are
to
a
man,
but
because
a
new
and
powerful
interest
bore
them
down
and
drove
them
out
of
his
mind
for
the
time--just
as
men's
misfortunes
are
forgotten
in
the
excitement
of
new
enterprises.
This
new
interest
was
a
valued
novelty
in
whistling,
which
he
had
just
acquired
from
a
negro,
and
he
was
suffering
to
practise
it
undisturbed.
It
consisted
in
a
peculiar
bird-like
turn,
a
sort
of
liquid
warble,
produced
by
touching
the
tongue
to
the
roof
of
the
mouth
at
short
intervals
in
the
midst
of
the
music--the
reader
probably
remembers
how
to
do
it,
if
he
has
ever
been
a
boy.
Diligence
and
attention
soon
gave
him
the
knack
of
it,
and
he
strode
down
the
street
with
his
mouth
full
of
harmony
and
his
soul
full
of
gratitude.
He
felt
much
as
an
astronomer
feels
who
has
discovered
a
new
planet--no
doubt,
as
far
as
strong,
deep,
unalloyed
pleasure
is
concerned,
the
advantage
was
with
the
boy,
not
the
astronomer.
The
summer
evenings
were
long.
It
was
not
dark,
yet.
Presently
Tom
checked
his
whistle.
A
stranger
was
before
him--a
boy
a
shade
larger
than
himself.
A
new-comer
of
any
age
or
either
sex
was
an
impressive
curiosity
in
the
poor
little
shabby
village
of
St.
Petersburg.
This
boy
was
well
dressed,
too--well
dressed
on
a
week-day.
This
was
simply
astounding.
His
cap
was
a
dainty
thing,
his
close-buttoned
blue
cloth
roundabout
was
new
and
natty,
and
so
were
his
pantaloons.
He
had
shoes
on--and
it
was
only
Friday.
He
even
wore
a
necktie,
a
bright
bit
of
ribbon.
He
had
a
citified
air
about
him
that
ate
into
Tom's
vitals.
The
more
Tom
stared
at
the
splendid
marvel,
the
higher
he
turned
up
his
nose
at
his
finery
and
the
shabbier
and
shabbier
his
own
outfit
seemed
to
him
to
grow.
Neither
boy
spoke.
If
one
moved,
the
other
moved--but
only
sidewise,
in
a
circle;
they
kept
face
to
face
and
eye
to
eye
all
the
time.
Finally
Tom
said:
"I
can
lick
you!"
"I'd
like
to
see
you
try
it."
"Well,
I
can
do
it."
"No
you
can't,
either."
"Yes
I
can."
"No
you
can't."
"I
can."
"You
can't."
"Can!"
"Can't!"
An
uncomfortable
pause.
Then
Tom
said:
"What's
your
name?"
"'Tisn't
any
of
your
business,
maybe."
"Well
I
'low
I'll
MAKE
it
my
business."
"Well
why
don't
you?"
"If
you
say
much,
I
will."
"Much--much--MUCH.
There
now."
"Oh,
you
think
you're
mighty
smart,
DON'T
you?
I
could
lick
you
with
one
hand
tied
behind
me,
if
I
wanted
to."
"Well
why
don't
you
DO
it?
You
SAY
you
can
do
it."
"Well
I
WILL,
if
you
fool
with
me."
"Oh
yes--I've
seen
whole
families
in
the
same
fix."
"Smarty!
You
think
you're
SOME,
now,
DON'T
you?
Oh,
what
a
hat!"
"You
can
lump
that
hat
if
you
don't
like
it.
I
dare
you
to
knock
it
off--and
anybody
that'll
take
a
dare
will
suck
eggs."
"You're
a
liar!"
"You're
another."
"You're
a
fighting
liar
and
dasn't
take
it
up."
"Aw--take
a
walk!"
"Say--if
you
give
me
much
more
of
your
sass
I'll
take
and
bounce
a
rock
off'n
your
head."
"Oh,
of
COURSE
you
will."
"Well
I
WILL."
"Well
why
don't
you
DO
it
then?
What
do
you
keep
SAYING
you
will
for?
Why
don't
you
DO
it?
It's
because
you're
afraid."
"I
AIN'T
afraid."
"You
are."
"I
ain't."
"You
are."
Another
pause,
and
more
eying
and
sidling
around
each
other.
Presently
they
were
shoulder
to
shoulder.
Tom
said:
"Get
away
from
here!"
"Go
away
yourself!"
"I
won't."
"I
won't
either."
So
they
stood,
each
with
a
foot
placed
at
an
angle
as
a
brace,
and
both
shoving
with
might
and
main,
and
glowering
at
each
other
with
hate.
But
neither
could
get
an
advantage.
After
struggling
till
both
were
hot
and
flushed,
each
relaxed
his
strain
with
watchful
caution,
and
Tom
said:
"You're
a
coward
and
a
pup.
I'll
tell
my
big
brother
on
you,
and
he
can
thrash
you
with
his
little
finger,
and
I'll
make
him
do
it,
too."
"What
do
I
care
for
your
big
brother?
I've
got
a
brother
that's
bigger
than
he
is--and
what's
more,
he
can
throw
him
over
that
fence,
too."
[Both
brothers
were
imaginary.]
"That's
a
lie."
"YOUR
saying
so
don't
make
it
so."
Tom
drew
a
line
in
the
dust
with
his
big
toe,
and
said:
"I
dare
you
to
step
over
that,
and
I'll
lick
you
till
you
can't
stand
up.
Anybody
that'll
take
a
dare
will
steal
sheep."
The
new
boy
stepped
over
promptly,
and
said:
"Now
you
said
you'd
do
it,
now
let's
see
you
do
it."
"Don't
you
crowd
me
now;
you
better
look
out."
"Well,
you
SAID
you'd
do
it--why
don't
you
do
it?"
"By
jingo!
for
two
cents
I
WILL
do
it."
The
new
boy
took
two
broad
coppers
out
of
his
pocket
and
held
them
out
with
derision.
Tom
struck
them
to
the
ground.
In
an
instant
both
boys
were
rolling
and
tumbling
in
the
dirt,
gripped
together
like
cats;
and
for
the
space
of
a
minute
they
tugged
and
tore
at
each
other's
hair
and
clothes,
punched
and
scratched
each
other's
nose,
and
covered
themselves
with
dust
and
glory.
Presently
the
confusion
took
form,
and
through
the
fog
of
battle
Tom
appeared,
seated
astride
the
new
boy,
and
pounding
him
with
his
fists.
"Holler
'nuff!"
said
he.
The
boy
only
struggled
to
free
himself.
He
was
crying--mainly
from
rage.
"Holler
'nuff!"--and
the
pounding
went
on.
At
last
the
stranger
got
out
a
smothered
"'Nuff!"
and
Tom
let
him
up
and
said:
"Now
that'll
learn
you.
Better
look
out
who
you're
fooling
with
next
time."
The
new
boy
went
off
brushing
the
dust
from
his
clothes,
sobbing,
snuffling,
and
occasionally
looking
back
and
shaking
his
head
and
threatening
what
he
would
do
to
Tom
the
"next
time
he
caught
him
out."
To
which
Tom
responded
with
jeers,
and
started
off
in
high
feather,
and
as
soon
as
his
back
was
turned
the
new
boy
snatched
up
a
stone,
threw
it
and
hit
him
between
the
shoulders
and
then
turned
tail
and
ran
like
an
antelope.
Tom
chased
the
traitor
home,
and
thus
found
out
where
he
lived.
He
then
held
a
position
at
the
gate
for
some
time,
daring
the
enemy
to
come
outside,
but
the
enemy
only
made
faces
at
him
through
the
window
and
declined.
At
last
the
enemy's
mother
appeared,
and
called
Tom
a
bad,
vicious,
vulgar
child,
and
ordered
him
away.
So
he
went
away;
but
he
said
he
"'lowed"
to
"lay"
for
that
boy.
He
got
home
pretty
late
that
night,
and
when
he
climbed
cautiously
in
at
the
window,
he
uncovered
an
ambuscade,
in
the
person
of
his
aunt;
and
when
she
saw
the
state
his
clothes
were
in
her
resolution
to
turn
his
Saturday
holiday
into
captivity
at
hard
labor
became
adamantine
in
its
firmness.
CHAPTER
II
SATURDAY
morning
was
come,
and
all
the
summer
world
was
bright
and
fresh,
and
brimming
with
life.
There
was
a
song
in
every
heart;
and
if
the
heart
was
young
the
music
issued
at
the
lips.
There
was
cheer
in
every
face
and
a
spring
in
every
step.
The
locust-trees
were
in
bloom
and
the
fragrance
of
the
blossoms
filled
the
air.
Cardiff
Hill,
beyond
the
village
and
above
it,
was
green
with
vegetation
and
it
lay
just
far
enough
away
to
seem
a
Delectable
Land,
dreamy,
reposeful,
and
inviting.
Tom
appeared
on
the
sidewalk
with
a
bucket
of
whitewash
and
a
long-handled
brush.
He
surveyed
the
fence,
and
all
gladness
left
him
and
a
deep
melancholy
settled
down
upon
his
spirit.
Thirty
yards
of
board
fence
nine
feet
high.
Life
to
him
seemed
hollow,
and
existence
but
a
burden.
Sighing,
he
dipped
his
brush
and
passed
it
along
the
topmost
plank;
repeated
the
operation;
did
it
again;
compared
the
insignificant
whitewashed
streak
with
the
far-reaching
continent
of
unwhitewashed
fence,
and
sat
down
on
a
tree-box
discouraged.
Jim
came
skipping
out
at
the
gate
with
a
tin
pail,
and
singing
Buffalo
Gals.
Bringing
water
from
the
town
pump
had
always
been
hateful
work
in
Tom's
eyes,
before,
but
now
it
did
not
strike
him
so.
He
remembered
that
there
was
company
at
the
pump.
White,
mulatto,
and
negro
boys
and
girls
were
always
there
waiting
their
turns,
resting,
trading
playthings,
quarrelling,
fighting,
skylarking.
And
he
remembered
that
although
the
pump
was
only
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
off,
Jim
never
got
back
with
a
bucket
of
water
under
an
hour--and
even
then
somebody
generally
had
to
go
after
him.
Tom
said:
"Say,
Jim,
I'll
fetch
the
water
if
you'll
whitewash
some."
Jim
shook
his
head
and
said:
"Can't,
Mars
Tom.
Ole
missis,
she
tole
me
I
got
to
go
an'
git
dis
water
an'
not
stop
foolin'
roun'
wid
anybody.
She
say
she
spec'
Mars
Tom
gwine
to
ax
me
to
whitewash,
an'
so
she
tole
me
go
'long
an'
'tend
to
my
own
business--she
'lowed
SHE'D
'tend
to
de
whitewashin'."
"Oh,
never
you
mind
what
she
said,
Jim.
That's
the
way
she
always
talks.
Gimme
the
bucket--I
won't
be
gone
only
a
a
minute.
SHE
won't
ever
know."
"Oh,
I
dasn't,
Mars
Tom.
Ole
missis
she'd
take
an'
tar
de
head
off'n
me.
'Deed
she
would."
"SHE!
She
never
licks
anybody--whacks
'em
over
the
head
with
her
thimble--and
who
cares
for
that,
I'd
like
to
know.
She
talks
awful,
but
talk
don't
hurt--anyways
it
don't
if
she
don't
cry.
Jim,
I'll
give
you
a
marvel.
I'll
give
you
a
white
alley!"
Jim
began
to
waver.
"White
alley,
Jim!
And
it's
a
bully
taw."
"My!
Dat's
a
mighty
gay
marvel,
I
tell
you!
But
Mars
Tom
I's
powerful
'fraid
ole
missis--"
"And
besides,
if
you
will
I'll
show
you
my
sore
toe."
Jim
was
only
human--this
attraction
was
too
much
for
him.
He
put
down
his
pail,
took
the
white
alley,
and
bent
over
the
toe
with
absorbing
interest
while
the
bandage
was
being
unwound.
In
another
moment
he
was
flying
down
the
street
with
his
pail
and
a
tingling
rear,
Tom
was
whitewashing
with
vigor,
and
Aunt
Polly
was
retiring
from
the
field
with
a
slipper
in
her
hand
and
triumph
in
her
eye.
But
Tom's
energy
did
not
last.
He
began
to
think
of
the
fun
he
had
planned
for
this
day,
and
his
sorrows
multiplied.
Soon
the
free
boys
would
come
tripping
along
on
all
sorts
of
delicious
expeditions,
and
they
would
make
a
world
of
fun
of
him
for
having
to
work--the
very
thought
of
it
burnt
him
like
fire.
He
got
out
his
worldly
wealth
and
examined
it--bits
of
toys,
marbles,
and
trash;
enough
to
buy
an
exchange
of
WORK,
maybe,
but
not
half
enough
to
buy
so
much
as
half
an
hour
of
pure
freedom.
So
he
returned
his
straitened
means
to
his
pocket,
and
gave
up
the
idea
of
trying
to
buy
the
boys.
At
this
dark
and
hopeless
moment
an
inspiration
burst
upon
him!
Nothing
less
than
a
great,
magnificent
inspiration.
He
took
up
his
brush
and
went
tranquilly
to
work.
Ben
Rogers
hove
in
sight
presently--the
very
boy,
of
all
boys,
whose
ridicule
he
had
been
dreading.
Ben's
gait
was
the
hop-skip-and-jump--proof
enough
that
his
heart
was
light
and
his
anticipations
high.
He
was
eating
an
apple,
and
giving
a
long,
melodious
whoop,
at
intervals,
followed
by
a
deep-toned
ding-dong-dong,
ding-dong-dong,
for
he
was
personating
a
steamboat.
As
he
drew
near,
he
slackened
speed,
took
the
middle
of
the
street,
leaned
far
over
to
starboard
and
rounded
to
ponderously
and
with
laborious
pomp
and
circumstance--for
he
was
personating
the
Big
Missouri,
and
considered
himself
to
be
drawing
nine
feet
of
water.
He
was
boat
and
captain
and
engine-bells
combined,
so
he
had
to
imagine
himself
standing
on
his
own
hurricane-deck
giving
the
orders
and
executing
them:
"Stop
her,
sir!
Ting-a-ling-ling!"
The
headway
ran
almost
out,
and
he
drew
up
slowly
toward
the
sidewalk.
"Ship
up
to
back!
Ting-a-ling-ling!"
His
arms
straightened
and
stiffened
down
his
sides.
"Set
her
back
on
the
stabboard!
Ting-a-ling-ling!
Chow!
ch-chow-wow!
Chow!"
His
right
hand,
meantime,
describing
stately
circles--for
it
was
representing
a
forty-foot
wheel.
"Let
her
go
back
on
the
labboard!
Ting-a-lingling!
Chow-ch-chow-chow!"
The
left
hand
began
to
describe
circles.
"Stop
the
stabboard!
Ting-a-ling-ling!
Stop
the
labboard!
Come
ahead
on
the
stabboard!
Stop
her!
Let
your
outside
turn
over
slow!
Ting-a-ling-ling!
Chow-ow-ow!
Get
out
that
head-line!
LIVELY
now!
Come--out
with
your
spring-line--what're
you
about
there!
Take
a
turn
round
that
stump
with
the
bight
of
it!
Stand
by
that
stage,
now--let
her
go!
Done
with
the
engines,
sir!
Ting-a-ling-ling!
SH'T!
S'H'T!
SH'T!"
(trying
the
gauge-cocks).
Tom
went
on
whitewashing--paid
no
attention
to
the
steamboat.
Ben
stared
a
moment
and
then
said:
"Hi-YI!
YOU'RE
up
a
stump,
ain't
you!"
No
answer.
Tom
surveyed
his
last
touch
with
the
eye
of
an
artist,
then
he
gave
his
brush
another
gentle
sweep
and
surveyed
the
result,
as
before.
Ben
ranged
up
alongside
of
him.
Tom's
mouth
watered
for
the
apple,
but
he
stuck
to
his
work.
Ben
said:
"Hello,
old
chap,
you
got
to
work,
hey?"
Tom
wheeled
suddenly
and
said:
"Why,
it's
you,
Ben!
I
warn't
noticing."
"Say--I'm
going
in
a-swimming,
I
am.
Don't
you
wish
you
could?
But
of
course
you'd
druther
WORK--wouldn't
you?
Course
you
would!"
Tom
contemplated
the
boy
a
bit,
and
said:
"What
do
you
call
work?"
"Why,
ain't
THAT
work?"
Tom
resumed
his
whitewashing,
and
answered
carelessly:
"Well,
maybe
it
is,
and
maybe
it
ain't.
All
I
know,
is,
it
suits
Tom
Sawyer."
"Oh
come,
now,
you
don't
mean
to
let
on
that
you
LIKE
it?"
The
brush
continued
to
move.
"Like
it?
Well,
I
don't
see
why
I
oughtn't
to
like
it.
Does
a
boy
get
a
chance
to
whitewash
a
fence
every
day?"
That
put
the
thing
in
a
new
light.
Ben
stopped
nibbling
his
apple.
Tom
swept
his
brush
daintily
back
and
forth--stepped
back
to
note
the
effect--added
a
touch
here
and
there--criticised
the
effect
again--Ben
watching
every
move
and
getting
more
and
more
interested,
more
and
more
absorbed.
Presently
he
said:
"Say,
Tom,
let
ME
whitewash
a
little."
Tom
considered,
was
about
to
consent;
but
he
altered
his
mind:
"No--no--I
reckon
it
wouldn't
hardly
do,
Ben.
You
see,
Aunt
Polly's
awful
particular
about
this
fence--right
here
on
the
street,
you
know
--but
if
it
was
the
back
fence
I
wouldn't
mind
and
SHE
wouldn't.
Yes,
she's
awful
particular
about
this
fence;
it's
got
to
be
done
very
careful;
I
reckon
there
ain't
one
boy
in
a
thousand,
maybe
two
thousand,
that
can
do
it
the
way
it's
got
to
be
done."
"No--is
that
so?
Oh
come,
now--lemme
just
try.
Only
just
a
little--I'd
let
YOU,
if
you
was
me,
Tom."
"Ben,
I'd
like
to,
honest
injun;
but
Aunt
Polly--well,
Jim
wanted
to
do
it,
but
she
wouldn't
let
him;
Sid
wanted
to
do
it,
and
she
wouldn't
let
Sid.
Now
don't
you
see
how
I'm
fixed?
If
you
was
to
tackle
this
fence
and
anything
was
to
happen
to
it--"
"Oh,
shucks,
I'll
be
just
as
careful.
Now
lemme
try.
Say--I'll
give
you
the
core
of
my
apple."
"Well,
here--No,
Ben,
now
don't.
I'm
afeard--"
"I'll
give
you
ALL
of
it!"
Tom
gave
up
the
brush
with
reluctance
in
his
face,
but
alacrity
in
his
heart.
And
while
the
late
steamer
Big
Missouri
worked
and
sweated
in
the
sun,
the
retired
artist
sat
on
a
barrel
in
the
shade
close
by,
dangled
his
legs,
munched
his
apple,
and
planned
the
slaughter
of
more
innocents.
There
was
no
lack
of
material;
boys
happened
along
every
little
while;
they
came
to
jeer,
but
remained
to
whitewash.
By
the
time
Ben
was
fagged
out,
Tom
had
traded
the
next
chance
to
Billy
Fisher
for
a
kite,
in
good
repair;
and
when
he
played
out,
Johnny
Miller
bought
in
for
a
dead
rat
and
a
string
to
swing
it
with--and
so
on,
and
so
on,
hour
after
hour.
And
when
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
came,
from
being
a
poor
poverty-stricken
boy
in
the
morning,
Tom
was
literally
rolling
in
wealth.
He
had
besides
the
things
before
mentioned,
twelve
marbles,
part
of
a
jews-harp,
a
piece
of
blue
bottle-glass
to
look
through,
a
spool
cannon,
a
key
that
wouldn't
unlock
anything,
a
fragment
of
chalk,
a
glass
stopper
of
a
decanter,
a
tin
soldier,
a
couple
of
tadpoles,
six
fire-crackers,
a
kitten
with
only
one
eye,
a
brass
doorknob,
a
dog-collar--but
no
dog--the
handle
of
a
knife,
four
pieces
of
orange-peel,
and
a
dilapidated
old
window
sash.
He
had
had
a
nice,
good,
idle
time
all
the
while--plenty
of
company
--and
the
fence
had
three
coats
of
whitewash
on
it!
If
he
hadn't
run
out
of
whitewash
he
would
have
bankrupted
every
boy
in
the
village.
Tom
said
to
himself
that
it
was
not
such
a
hollow
world,
after
all.
He
had
discovered
a
great
law
of
human
action,
without
knowing
it--namely,
that
in
order
to
make
a
man
or
a
boy
covet
a
thing,
it
is
only
necessary
to
make
the
thing
difficult
to
attain.
If
he
had
been
a
great
and
wise
philosopher,
like
the
writer
of
this
book,
he
would
now
have
comprehended
that
Work
consists
of
whatever
a
body
is
OBLIGED
to
do,
and
that
Play
consists
of
whatever
a
body
is
not
obliged
to
do.
And
this
would
help
him
to
understand
why
constructing
artificial
flowers
or
performing
on
a
tread-mill
is
work,
while
rolling
ten-pins
or
climbing
Mont
Blanc
is
only
amusement.
There
are
wealthy
gentlemen
in
England
who
drive
four-horse
passenger-coaches
twenty
or
thirty
miles
on
a
daily
line,
in
the
summer,
because
the
privilege
costs
them
considerable
money;
but
if
they
were
offered
wages
for
the
service,
that
would
turn
it
into
work
and
then
they
would
resign.
The
boy
mused
awhile
over
the
substantial
change
which
had
taken
place
in
his
worldly
circumstances,
and
then
wended
toward
headquarters
to
report.
CHAPTER
III
TOM
presented
himself
before
Aunt
Polly,
who
was
sitting
by
an
open
window
in
a
pleasant
rearward
apartment,
which
was
bedroom,
breakfast-room,
dining-room,
and
library,
combined.
The
balmy
summer
air,
the
restful
quiet,
the
odor
of
the
flowers,
and
the
drowsing
murmur
of
the
bees
had
had
their
effect,
and
she
was
nodding
over
her
knitting
--for
she
had
no
company
but
the
cat,
and
it
was
asleep
in
her
lap.
Her
spectacles
were
propped
up
on
her
gray
head
for
safety.
She
had
thought
that
of
course
Tom
had
deserted
long
ago,
and
she
wondered
at
seeing
him
place
himself
in
her
power
again
in
this
intrepid
way.
He
said:
"Mayn't
I
go
and
play
now,
aunt?"
"What,
a'ready?
How
much
have
you
done?"
"It's
all
done,
aunt."
"Tom,
don't
lie
to
me--I
can't
bear
it."
"I
ain't,
aunt;
it
IS
all
done."
Aunt
Polly
placed
small
trust
in
such
evidence.
She
went
out
to
see
for
herself;
and
she
would
have
been
content
to
find
twenty
per
cent.
of
Tom's
statement
true.
When
she
found
the
entire
fence
whitewashed,
and
not
only
whitewashed
but
elaborately
coated
and
recoated,
and
even
a
streak
added
to
the
ground,
her
astonishment
was
almost
unspeakable.
She
said:
"Well,
I
never!
There's
no
getting
round
it,
you
can
work
when
you're
a
mind
to,
Tom."
And
then
she
diluted
the
compliment
by
adding,
"But
it's
powerful
seldom
you're
a
mind
to,
I'm
bound
to
say.
Well,
go
'long
and
play;
but
mind
you
get
back
some
time
in
a
week,
or
I'll
tan
you."
She
was
so
overcome
by
the
splendor
of
his
achievement
that
she
took
him
into
the
closet
and
selected
a
choice
apple
and
delivered
it
to
him,
along
with
an
improving
lecture
upon
the
added
value
and
flavor
a
treat
took
to
itself
when
it
came
without
sin
through
virtuous
effort.
And
while
she
closed
with
a
happy
Scriptural
flourish,
he
"hooked"
a
doughnut.
Then
he
skipped
out,
and
saw
Sid
just
starting
up
the
outside
stairway
that
led
to
the
back
rooms
on
the
second
floor.
Clods
were
handy
and
the
air
was
full
of
them
in
a
twinkling.
They
raged
around
Sid
like
a
hail-storm;
and
before
Aunt
Polly
could
collect
her
surprised
faculties
and
sally
to
the
rescue,
six
or
seven
clods
had
taken
personal
effect,
and
Tom
was
over
the
fence
and
gone.
There
was
a
gate,
but
as
a
general
thing
he
was
too
crowded
for
time
to
make
use
of
it.
His
soul
was
at
peace,
now
that
he
had
settled
with
Sid
for
calling
attention
to
his
black
thread
and
getting
him
into
trouble.
Tom
skirted
the
block,
and
came
round
into
a
muddy
alley
that
led
by
the
back
of
his
aunt's
cow-stable.
He
presently
got
safely
beyond
the
reach
of
capture
and
punishment,
and
hastened
toward
the
public
square
of
the
village,
where
two
"military"
companies
of
boys
had
met
for
conflict,
according
to
previous
appointment.
Tom
was
General
of
one
of
these
armies,
Joe
Harper
(a
bosom
friend)
General
of
the
other.
These
two
great
commanders
did
not
condescend
to
fight
in
person--that
being
better
suited
to
the
still
smaller
fry--but
sat
together
on
an
eminence
and
conducted
the
field
operations
by
orders
delivered
through
aides-de-camp.
Tom's
army
won
a
great
victory,
after
a
long
and
hard-fought
battle.
Then
the
dead
were
counted,
prisoners
exchanged,
the
terms
of
the
next
disagreement
agreed
upon,
and
the
day
for
the
necessary
battle
appointed;
after
which
the
armies
fell
into
line
and
marched
away,
and
Tom
turned
homeward
alone.
As
he
was
passing
by
the
house
where
Jeff
Thatcher
lived,
he
saw
a
new
girl
in
the
garden--a
lovely
little
blue-eyed
creature
with
yellow
hair
plaited
into
two
long-tails,
white
summer
frock
and
embroidered
pantalettes.
The
fresh-crowned
hero
fell
without
firing
a
shot.
A
certain
Amy
Lawrence
vanished
out
of
his
heart
and
left
not
even
a
memory
of
herself
behind.
He
had
thought
he
loved
her
to
distraction;
he
had
regarded
his
passion
as
adoration;
and
behold
it
was
only
a
poor
little
evanescent
partiality.
He
had
been
months
winning
her;
she
had
confessed
hardly
a
week
ago;
he
had
been
the
happiest
and
the
proudest
boy
in
the
world
only
seven
short
days,
and
here
in
one
instant
of
time
she
had
gone
out
of
his
heart
like
a
casual
stranger
whose
visit
is
done.
He
worshipped
this
new
angel
with
furtive
eye,
till
he
saw
that
she
had
discovered
him;
then
he
pretended
he
did
not
know
she
was
present,
and
began
to
"show
off"
in
all
sorts
of
absurd
boyish
ways,
in
order
to
win
her
admiration.
He
kept
up
this
grotesque
foolishness
for
some
time;
but
by-and-by,
while
he
was
in
the
midst
of
some
dangerous
gymnastic
performances,
he
glanced
aside
and
saw
that
the
little
girl
was
wending
her
way
toward
the
house.
Tom
came
up
to
the
fence
and
leaned
on
it,
grieving,
and
hoping
she
would
tarry
yet
awhile
longer.
She
halted
a
moment
on
the
steps
and
then
moved
toward
the
door.
Tom
heaved
a
great
sigh
as
she
put
her
foot
on
the
threshold.
But
his
face
lit
up,
right
away,
for
she
tossed
a
pansy
over
the
fence
a
moment
before
she
disappeared.
The
boy
ran
around
and
stopped
within
a
foot
or
two
of
the
flower,
and
then
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
began
to
look
down
street
as
if
he
had
discovered
something
of
interest
going
on
in
that
direction.
Presently
he
picked
up
a
straw
and
began
trying
to
balance
it
on
his
nose,
with
his
head
tilted
far
back;
and
as
he
moved
from
side
to
side,
in
his
efforts,
he
edged
nearer
and
nearer
toward
the
pansy;
finally
his
bare
foot
rested
upon
it,
his
pliant
toes
closed
upon
it,
and
he
hopped
away
with
the
treasure
and
disappeared
round
the
corner.
But
only
for
a
minute--only
while
he
could
button
the
flower
inside
his
jacket,
next
his
heart--or
next
his
stomach,
possibly,
for
he
was
not
much
posted
in
anatomy,
and
not
hypercritical,
anyway.
He
returned,
now,
and
hung
about
the
fence
till
nightfall,
"showing
off,"
as
before;
but
the
girl
never
exhibited
herself
again,
though
Tom
comforted
himself
a
little
with
the
hope
that
she
had
been
near
some
window,
meantime,
and
been
aware
of
his
attentions.
Finally
he
strode
home
reluctantly,
with
his
poor
head
full
of
visions.
All
through
supper
his
spirits
were
so
high
that
his
aunt
wondered
"what
had
got
into
the
child."
He
took
a
good
scolding
about
clodding
Sid,
and
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
in
the
least.
He
tried
to
steal
sugar
under
his
aunt's
very
nose,
and
got
his
knuckles
rapped
for
it.
He
said:
"Aunt,
you
don't
whack
Sid
when
he
takes
it."
"Well,
Sid
don't
torment
a
body
the
way
you
do.
You'd
be
always
into
that
sugar
if
I
warn't
watching
you."
Presently
she
stepped
into
the
kitchen,
and
Sid,
happy
in
his
immunity,
reached
for
the
sugar-bowl--a
sort
of
glorying
over
Tom
which
was
wellnigh
unbearable.
But
Sid's
fingers
slipped
and
the
bowl
dropped
and
broke.
Tom
was
in
ecstasies.
In
such
ecstasies
that
he
even
controlled
his
tongue
and
was
silent.
He
said
to
himself
that
he
would
not
speak
a
word,
even
when
his
aunt
came
in,
but
would
sit
perfectly
still
till
she
asked
who
did
the
mischief;
and
then
he
would
tell,
and
there
would
be
nothing
so
good
in
the
world
as
to
see
that
pet
model
"catch
it."
He
was
so
brimful
of
exultation
that
he
could
hardly
hold
himself
when
the
old
lady
came
back
and
stood
above
the
wreck
discharging
lightnings
of
wrath
from
over
her
spectacles.
He
said
to
himself,
"Now
it's
coming!"
And
the
next
instant
he
was
sprawling
on
the
floor!
The
potent
palm
was
uplifted
to
strike
again
when
Tom
cried
out:
"Hold
on,
now,
what
'er
you
belting
ME
for?--Sid
broke
it!"
Aunt
Polly
paused,
perplexed,
and
Tom
looked
for
healing
pity.
But
when
she
got
her
tongue
again,
she
only
said:
"Umf!
Well,
you
didn't
get
a
lick
amiss,
I
reckon.
You
been
into
some
other
audacious
mischief
when
I
wasn't
around,
like
enough."
Then
her
conscience
reproached
her,
and
she
yearned
to
say
something
kind
and
loving;
but
she
judged
that
this
would
be
construed
into
a
confession
that
she
had
been
in
the
wrong,
and
discipline
forbade
that.
So
she
kept
silence,
and
went
about
her
affairs
with
a
troubled
heart.
Tom
sulked
in
a
corner
and
exalted
his
woes.
He
knew
that
in
her
heart
his
aunt
was
on
her
knees
to
him,
and
he
was
morosely
gratified
by
the
consciousness
of
it.
He
would
hang
out
no
signals,
he
would
take
notice
of
none.
He
knew
that
a
yearning
glance
fell
upon
him,
now
and
then,
through
a
film
of
tears,
but
he
refused
recognition
of
it.
He
pictured
himself
lying
sick
unto
death
and
his
aunt
bending
over
him
beseeching
one
little
forgiving
word,
but
he
would
turn
his
face
to
the
wall,
and
die
with
that
word
unsaid.
Ah,
how
would
she
feel
then?
And
he
pictured
himself
brought
home
from
the
river,
dead,
with
his
curls
all
wet,
and
his
sore
heart
at
rest.
How
she
would
throw
herself
upon
him,
and
how
her
tears
would
fall
like
rain,
and
her
lips
pray
God
to
give
her
back
her
boy
and
she
would
never,
never
abuse
him
any
more!
But
he
would
lie
there
cold
and
white
and
make
no
sign--a
poor
little
sufferer,
whose
griefs
were
at
an
end.
He
so
worked
upon
his
feelings
with
the
pathos
of
these
dreams,
that
he
had
to
keep
swallowing,
he
was
so
like
to
choke;
and
his
eyes
swam
in
a
blur
of
water,
which
overflowed
when
he
winked,
and
ran
down
and
trickled
from
the
end
of
his
nose.
And
such
a
luxury
to
him
was
this
petting
of
his
sorrows,
that
he
could
not
bear
to
have
any
worldly
cheeriness
or
any
grating
delight
intrude
upon
it;
it
was
too
sacred
for
such
contact;
and
so,
presently,
when
his
cousin
Mary
danced
in,
all
alive
with
the
joy
of
seeing
home
again
after
an
age-long
visit
of
one
week
to
the
country,
he
got
up
and
moved
in
clouds
and
darkness
out
at
one
door
as
she
brought
song
and
sunshine
in
at
the
other.
He
wandered
far
from
the
accustomed
haunts
of
boys,
and
sought
desolate
places
that
were
in
harmony
with
his
spirit.
A
log
raft
in
the
river
invited
him,
and
he
seated
himself
on
its
outer
edge
and
contemplated
the
dreary
vastness
of
the
stream,
wishing,
the
while,
that
he
could
only
be
drowned,
all
at
once
and
unconsciously,
without
undergoing
the
uncomfortable
routine
devised
by
nature.
Then
he
thought
of
his
flower.
He
got
it
out,
rumpled
and
wilted,
and
it
mightily
increased
his
dismal
felicity.
He
wondered
if
she
would
pity
him
if
she
knew?
Would
she
cry,
and
wish
that
she
had
a
right
to
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
comfort
him?
Or
would
she
turn
coldly
away
like
all
the
hollow
world?
This
picture
brought
such
an
agony
of
pleasurable
suffering
that
he
worked
it
over
and
over
again
in
his
mind
and
set
it
up
in
new
and
varied
lights,
till
he
wore
it
threadbare.
At
last
he
rose
up
sighing
and
departed
in
the
darkness.
About
half-past
nine
or
ten
o'clock
he
came
along
the
deserted
street
to
where
the
Adored
Unknown
lived;
he
paused
a
moment;
no
sound
fell
upon
his
listening
ear;
a
candle
was
casting
a
dull
glow
upon
the
curtain
of
a
second-story
window.
Was
the
sacred
presence
there?
He
climbed
the
fence,
threaded
his
stealthy
way
through
the
plants,
till
he
stood
under
that
window;
he
looked
up
at
it
long,
and
with
emotion;
then
he
laid
him
down
on
the
ground
under
it,
disposing
himself
upon
his
back,
with
his
hands
clasped
upon
his
breast
and
holding
his
poor
wilted
flower.
And
thus
he
would
die--out
in
the
cold
world,
with
no
shelter
over
his
homeless
head,
no
friendly
hand
to
wipe
the
death-damps
from
his
brow,
no
loving
face
to
bend
pityingly
over
him
when
the
great
agony
came.
And
thus
SHE
would
see
him
when
she
looked
out
upon
the
glad
morning,
and
oh!
would
she
drop
one
little
tear
upon
his
poor,
lifeless
form,
would
she
heave
one
little
sigh
to
see
a
bright
young
life
so
rudely
blighted,
so
untimely
cut
down?
The
window
went
up,
a
maid-servant's
discordant
voice
profaned
the
holy
calm,
and
a
deluge
of
water
drenched
the
prone
martyr's
remains!
The
strangling
hero
sprang
up
with
a
relieving
snort.
There
was
a
whiz
as
of
a
missile
in
the
air,
mingled
with
the
murmur
of
a
curse,
a
sound
as
of
shivering
glass
followed,
and
a
small,
vague
form
went
over
the
fence
and
shot
away
in
the
gloom.
Not
long
after,
as
Tom,
all
undressed
for
bed,
was
surveying
his
drenched
garments
by
the
light
of
a
tallow
dip,
Sid
woke
up;
but
if
he
had
any
dim
idea
of
making
any
"references
to
allusions,"
he
thought
better
of
it
and
held
his
peace,
for
there
was
danger
in
Tom's
eye.
Tom
turned
in
without
the
added
vexation
of
prayers,
and
Sid
made
mental
note
of
the
omission.
CHAPTER
IV
THE
sun
rose
upon
a
tranquil
world,
and
beamed
down
upon
the
peaceful
village
like
a
benediction.
Breakfast
over,
Aunt
Polly
had
family
worship:
it
began
with
a
prayer
built
from
the
ground
up
of
solid
courses
of
Scriptural
quotations,
welded
together
with
a
thin
mortar
of
originality;
and
from
the
summit
of
this
she
delivered
a
grim
chapter
of
the
Mosaic
Law,
as
from
Sinai.
Then
Tom
girded
up
his
loins,
so
to
speak,
and
went
to
work
to
"get
his
verses."
Sid
had
learned
his
lesson
days
before.
Tom
bent
all
his
energies
to
the
memorizing
of
five
verses,
and
he
chose
part
of
the
Sermon
on
the
Mount,
because
he
could
find
no
verses
that
were
shorter.
At
the
end
of
half
an
hour
Tom
had
a
vague
general
idea
of
his
lesson,
but
no
more,
for
his
mind
was
traversing
the
whole
field
of
human
thought,
and
his
hands
were
busy
with
distracting
recreations.
Mary
took
his
book
to
hear
him
recite,
and
he
tried
to
find
his
way
through
the
fog:
"Blessed
are
the--a--a--"
"Poor"--
"Yes--poor;
blessed
are
the
poor--a--a--"
"In
spirit--"
"In
spirit;
blessed
are
the
poor
in
spirit,
for
they--they--"
"THEIRS--"
"For
THEIRS.
Blessed
are
the
poor
in
spirit,
for
theirs
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven.
Blessed
are
they
that
mourn,
for
they--they--"
"Sh--"
"For
they--a--"
"S,
H,
A--"
"For
they
S,
H--Oh,
I
don't
know
what
it
is!"
"SHALL!"
"Oh,
SHALL!
for
they
shall--for
they
shall--a--a--shall
mourn--a--a--
blessed
are
they
that
shall--they
that--a--they
that
shall
mourn,
for
they
shall--a--shall
WHAT?
Why
don't
you
tell
me,
Mary?--what
do
you
want
to
be
so
mean
for?"
"Oh,
Tom,
you
poor
thick-headed
thing,
I'm
not
teasing
you.
I
wouldn't
do
that.
You
must
go
and
learn
it
again.
Don't
you
be
discouraged,
Tom,
you'll
manage
it--and
if
you
do,
I'll
give
you
something
ever
so
nice.
There,
now,
that's
a
good
boy."
"All
right!
What
is
it,
Mary,
tell
me
what
it
is."
"Never
you
mind,
Tom.
You
know
if
I
say
it's
nice,
it
is
nice."
"You
bet
you
that's
so,
Mary.
All
right,
I'll
tackle
it
again."
And
he
did
"tackle
it
again"--and
under
the
double
pressure
of
curiosity
and
prospective
gain
he
did
it
with
such
spirit
that
he
accomplished
a
shining
success.
Mary
gave
him
a
brand-new
"Barlow"
knife
worth
twelve
and
a
half
cents;
and
the
convulsion
of
delight
that
swept
his
system
shook
him
to
his
foundations.
True,
the
knife
would
not
cut
anything,
but
it
was
a
"sure-enough"
Barlow,
and
there
was
inconceivable
grandeur
in
that--though
where
the
Western
boys
ever
got
the
idea
that
such
a
weapon
could
possibly
be
counterfeited
to
its
injury
is
an
imposing
mystery
and
will
always
remain
so,
perhaps.
Tom
contrived
to
scarify
the
cupboard
with
it,
and
was
arranging
to
begin
on
the
bureau,
when
he
was
called
off
to
dress
for
Sunday-school.
Mary
gave
him
a
tin
basin
of
water
and
a
piece
of
soap,
and
he
went
outside
the
door
and
set
the
basin
on
a
little
bench
there;
then
he
dipped
the
soap
in
the
water
and
laid
it
down;
turned
up
his
sleeves;
poured
out
the
water
on
the
ground,
gently,
and
then
entered
the
kitchen
and
began
to
wipe
his
face
diligently
on
the
towel
behind
the
door.
But
Mary
removed
the
towel
and
said:
"Now
ain't
you
ashamed,
Tom.
You
mustn't
be
so
bad.
Water
won't
hurt
you."
Tom
was
a
trifle
disconcerted.
The
basin
was
refilled,
and
this
time
he
stood
over
it
a
little
while,
gathering
resolution;
took
in
a
big
breath
and
began.
When
he
entered
the
kitchen
presently,
with
both
eyes
shut
and
groping
for
the
towel
with
his
hands,
an
honorable
testimony
of
suds
and
water
was
dripping
from
his
face.
But
when
he
emerged
from
the
towel,
he
was
not
yet
satisfactory,
for
the
clean
territory
stopped
short
at
his
chin
and
his
jaws,
like
a
mask;
below
and
beyond
this
line
there
was
a
dark
expanse
of
unirrigated
soil
that
spread
downward
in
front
and
backward
around
his
neck.
Mary
took
him
in
hand,
and
when
she
was
done
with
him
he
was
a
man
and
a
brother,
without
distinction
of
color,
and
his
saturated
hair
was
neatly
brushed,
and
its
short
curls
wrought
into
a
dainty
and
symmetrical
general
effect.
[He
privately
smoothed
out
the
curls,
with
labor
and
difficulty,
and
plastered
his
hair
close
down
to
his
head;
for
he
held
curls
to
be
effeminate,
and
his
own
filled
his
life
with
bitterness.]
Then
Mary
got
out
a
suit
of
his
clothing
that
had
been
used
only
on
Sundays
during
two
years--they
were
simply
called
his
"other
clothes"--and
so
by
that
we
know
the
size
of
his
wardrobe.
The
girl
"put
him
to
rights"
after
he
had
dressed
himself;
she
buttoned
his
neat
roundabout
up
to
his
chin,
turned
his
vast
shirt
collar
down
over
his
shoulders,
brushed
him
off
and
crowned
him
with
his
speckled
straw
hat.
He
now
looked
exceedingly
improved
and
uncomfortable.
He
was
fully
as
uncomfortable
as
he
looked;
for
there
was
a
restraint
about
whole
clothes
and
cleanliness
that
galled
him.
He
hoped
that
Mary
would
forget
his
shoes,
but
the
hope
was
blighted;
she
coated
them
thoroughly
with
tallow,
as
was
the
custom,
and
brought
them
out.
He
lost
his
temper
and
said
he
was
always
being
made
to
do
everything
he
didn't
want
to
do.
But
Mary
said,
persuasively:
"Please,
Tom--that's
a
good
boy."
So
he
got
into
the
shoes
snarling.
Mary
was
soon
ready,
and
the
three
children
set
out
for
Sunday-school--a
place
that
Tom
hated
with
his
whole
heart;
but
Sid
and
Mary
were
fond
of
it.
Sabbath-school
hours
were
from
nine
to
half-past
ten;
and
then
church
service.
Two
of
the
children
always
remained
for
the
sermon
voluntarily,
and
the
other
always
remained
too--for
stronger
reasons.
The
church's
high-backed,
uncushioned
pews
would
seat
about
three
hundred
persons;
the
edifice
was
but
a
small,
plain
affair,
with
a
sort
of
pine
board
tree-box
on
top
of
it
for
a
steeple.
At
the
door
Tom
dropped
back
a
step
and
accosted
a
Sunday-dressed
comrade:
"Say,
Billy,
got
a
yaller
ticket?"
"Yes."
"What'll
you
take
for
her?"
"What'll
you
give?"
"Piece
of
lickrish
and
a
fish-hook."
"Less
see
'em."
Tom
exhibited.
They
were
satisfactory,
and
the
property
changed
hands.
Then
Tom
traded
a
couple
of
white
alleys
for
three
red
tickets,
and
some
small
trifle
or
other
for
a
couple
of
blue
ones.
He
waylaid
other
boys
as
they
came,
and
went
on
buying
tickets
of
various
colors
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
longer.
He
entered
the
church,
now,
with
a
swarm
of
clean
and
noisy
boys
and
girls,
proceeded
to
his
seat
and
started
a
quarrel
with
the
first
boy
that
came
handy.
The
teacher,
a
grave,
elderly
man,
interfered;
then
turned
his
back
a
moment
and
Tom
pulled
a
boy's
hair
in
the
next
bench,
and
was
absorbed
in
his
book
when
the
boy
turned
around;
stuck
a
pin
in
another
boy,
presently,
in
order
to
hear
him
say
"Ouch!"
and
got
a
new
reprimand
from
his
teacher.
Tom's
whole
class
were
of
a
pattern--restless,
noisy,
and
troublesome.
When
they
came
to
recite
their
lessons,
not
one
of
them
knew
his
verses
perfectly,
but
had
to
be
prompted
all
along.
However,
they
worried
through,
and
each
got
his
reward--in
small
blue
tickets,
each
with
a
passage
of
Scripture
on
it;
each
blue
ticket
was
pay
for
two
verses
of
the
recitation.
Ten
blue
tickets
equalled
a
red
one,
and
could
be
exchanged
for
it;
ten
red
tickets
equalled
a
yellow
one;
for
ten
yellow
tickets
the
superintendent
gave
a
very
plainly
bound
Bible
(worth
forty
cents
in
those
easy
times)
to
the
pupil.
How
many
of
my
readers
would
have
the
industry
and
application
to
memorize
two
thousand
verses,
even
for
a
Dore
Bible?
And
yet
Mary
had
acquired
two
Bibles
in
this
way--it
was
the
patient
work
of
two
years--and
a
boy
of
German
parentage
had
won
four
or
five.
He
once
recited
three
thousand
verses
without
stopping;
but
the
strain
upon
his
mental
faculties
was
too
great,
and
he
was
little
better
than
an
idiot
from
that
day
forth--a
grievous
misfortune
for
the
school,
for
on
great
occasions,
before
company,
the
superintendent
(as
Tom
expressed
it)
had
always
made
this
boy
come
out
and
"spread
himself."
Only
the
older
pupils
managed
to
keep
their
tickets
and
stick
to
their
tedious
work
long
enough
to
get
a
Bible,
and
so
the
delivery
of
one
of
these
prizes
was
a
rare
and
noteworthy
circumstance;
the
successful
pupil
was
so
great
and
conspicuous
for
that
day
that
on
the
spot
every
scholar's
heart
was
fired
with
a
fresh
ambition
that
often
lasted
a
couple
of
weeks.
It
is
possible
that
Tom's
mental
stomach
had
never
really
hungered
for
one
of
those
prizes,
but
unquestionably
his
entire
being
had
for
many
a
day
longed
for
the
glory
and
the
eclat
that
came
with
it.
In
due
course
the
superintendent
stood
up
in
front
of
the
pulpit,
with
a
closed
hymn-book
in
his
hand
and
his
forefinger
inserted
between
its
leaves,
and
commanded
attention.
When
a
Sunday-school
superintendent
makes
his
customary
little
speech,
a
hymn-book
in
the
hand
is
as
necessary
as
is
the
inevitable
sheet
of
music
in
the
hand
of
a
singer
who
stands
forward
on
the
platform
and
sings
a
solo
at
a
concert
--though
why,
is
a
mystery:
for
neither
the
hymn-book
nor
the
sheet
of
music
is
ever
referred
to
by
the
sufferer.
This
superintendent
was
a
slim
creature
of
thirty-five,
with
a
sandy
goatee
and
short
sandy
hair;
he
wore
a
stiff
standing-collar
whose
upper
edge
almost
reached
his
ears
and
whose
sharp
points
curved
forward
abreast
the
corners
of
his
mouth--a
fence
that
compelled
a
straight
lookout
ahead,
and
a
turning
of
the
whole
body
when
a
side
view
was
required;
his
chin
was
propped
on
a
spreading
cravat
which
was
as
broad
and
as
long
as
a
bank-note,
and
had
fringed
ends;
his
boot
toes
were
turned
sharply
up,
in
the
fashion
of
the
day,
like
sleigh-runners--an
effect
patiently
and
laboriously
produced
by
the
young
men
by
sitting
with
their
toes
pressed
against
a
wall
for
hours
together.
Mr.
Walters
was
very
earnest
of
mien,
and
very
sincere
and
honest
at
heart;
and
he
held
sacred
things
and
places
in
such
reverence,
and
so
separated
them
from
worldly
matters,
that
unconsciously
to
himself
his
Sunday-school
voice
had
acquired
a
peculiar
intonation
which
was
wholly
absent
on
week-days.
He
began
after
this
fashion:
"Now,
children,
I
want
you
all
to
sit
up
just
as
straight
and
pretty
as
you
can
and
give
me
all
your
attention
for
a
minute
or
two.
There
--that
is
it.
That
is
the
way
good
little
boys
and
girls
should
do.
I
see
one
little
girl
who
is
looking
out
of
the
window--I
am
afraid
she
thinks
I
am
out
there
somewhere--perhaps
up
in
one
of
the
trees
making
a
speech
to
the
little
birds.
[Applausive
titter.]
I
want
to
tell
you
how
good
it
makes
me
feel
to
see
so
many
bright,
clean
little
faces
assembled
in
a
place
like
this,
learning
to
do
right
and
be
good."
And
so
forth
and
so
on.
It
is
not
necessary
to
set
down
the
rest
of
the
oration.
It
was
of
a
pattern
which
does
not
vary,
and
so
it
is
familiar
to
us
all.
The
latter
third
of
the
speech
was
marred
by
the
resumption
of
fights
and
other
recreations
among
certain
of
the
bad
boys,
and
by
fidgetings
and
whisperings
that
extended
far
and
wide,
washing
even
to
the
bases
of
isolated
and
incorruptible
rocks
like
Sid
and
Mary.
But
now
every
sound
ceased
suddenly,
with
the
subsidence
of
Mr.
Walters'
voice,
and
the
conclusion
of
the
speech
was
received
with
a
burst
of
silent
gratitude.
A
good
part
of
the
whispering
had
been
occasioned
by
an
event
which
was
more
or
less
rare--the
entrance
of
visitors:
lawyer
Thatcher,
accompanied
by
a
very
feeble
and
aged
man;
a
fine,
portly,
middle-aged
gentleman
with
iron-gray
hair;
and
a
dignified
lady
who
was
doubtless
the
latter's
wife.
The
lady
was
leading
a
child.
Tom
had
been
restless
and
full
of
chafings
and
repinings;
conscience-smitten,
too--he
could
not
meet
Amy
Lawrence's
eye,
he
could
not
brook
her
loving
gaze.
But
when
he
saw
this
small
new-comer
his
soul
was
all
ablaze
with
bliss
in
a
moment.
The
next
moment
he
was
"showing
off"
with
all
his
might
--cuffing
boys,
pulling
hair,
making
faces--in
a
word,
using
every
art
that
seemed
likely
to
fascinate
a
girl
and
win
her
applause.
His
exaltation
had
but
one
alloy--the
memory
of
his
humiliation
in
this
angel's
garden--and
that
record
in
sand
was
fast
washing
out,
under
the
waves
of
happiness
that
were
sweeping
over
it
now.
The
visitors
were
given
the
highest
seat
of
honor,
and
as
soon
as
Mr.
Walters'
speech
was
finished,
he
introduced
them
to
the
school.
The
middle-aged
man
turned
out
to
be
a
prodigious
personage--no
less
a
one
than
the
county
judge--altogether
the
most
august
creation
these
children
had
ever
looked
upon--and
they
wondered
what
kind
of
material
he
was
made
of--and
they
half
wanted
to
hear
him
roar,
and
were
half
afraid
he
might,
too.
He
was
from
Constantinople,
twelve
miles
away--so
he
had
travelled,
and
seen
the
world--these
very
eyes
had
looked
upon
the
county
court-house--which
was
said
to
have
a
tin
roof.
The
awe
which
these
reflections
inspired
was
attested
by
the
impressive
silence
and
the
ranks
of
staring
eyes.
This
was
the
great
Judge
Thatcher,
brother
of
their
own
lawyer.
Jeff
Thatcher
immediately
went
forward,
to
be
familiar
with
the
great
man
and
be
envied
by
the
school.
It
would
have
been
music
to
his
soul
to
hear
the
whisperings:
"Look
at
him,
Jim!
He's
a
going
up
there.
Say--look!
he's
a
going
to
shake
hands
with
him--he
IS
shaking
hands
with
him!
By
jings,
don't
you
wish
you
was
Jeff?"
Mr.
Walters
fell
to
"showing
off,"
with
all
sorts
of
official
bustlings
and
activities,
giving
orders,
delivering
judgments,
discharging
directions
here,
there,
everywhere
that
he
could
find
a
target.
The
librarian
"showed
off"--running
hither
and
thither
with
his
arms
full
of
books
and
making
a
deal
of
the
splutter
and
fuss
that
insect
authority
delights
in.
The
young
lady
teachers
"showed
off"
--bending
sweetly
over
pupils
that
were
lately
being
boxed,
lifting
pretty
warning
fingers
at
bad
little
boys
and
patting
good
ones
lovingly.
The
young
gentlemen
teachers
"showed
off"
with
small
scoldings
and
other
little
displays
of
authority
and
fine
attention
to
discipline--and
most
of
the
teachers,
of
both
sexes,
found
business
up
at
the
library,
by
the
pulpit;
and
it
was
business
that
frequently
had
to
be
done
over
again
two
or
three
times
(with
much
seeming
vexation).
The
little
girls
"showed
off"
in
various
ways,
and
the
little
boys
"showed
off"
with
such
diligence
that
the
air
was
thick
with
paper
wads
and
the
murmur
of
scufflings.
And
above
it
all
the
great
man
sat
and
beamed
a
majestic
judicial
smile
upon
all
the
house,
and
warmed
himself
in
the
sun
of
his
own
grandeur--for
he
was
"showing
off,"
too.
There
was
only
one
thing
wanting
to
make
Mr.
Walters'
ecstasy
complete,
and
that
was
a
chance
to
deliver
a
Bible-prize
and
exhibit
a
prodigy.
Several
pupils
had
a
few
yellow
tickets,
but
none
had
enough
--he
had
been
around
among
the
star
pupils
inquiring.
He
would
have
given
worlds,
now,
to
have
that
German
lad
back
again
with
a
sound
mind.
And
now
at
this
moment,
when
hope
was
dead,
Tom
Sawyer
came
forward
with
nine
yellow
tickets,
nine
red
tickets,
and
ten
blue
ones,
and
demanded
a
Bible.
This
was
a
thunderbolt
out
of
a
clear
sky.
Walters
was
not
expecting
an
application
from
this
source
for
the
next
ten
years.
But
there
was
no
getting
around
it--here
were
the
certified
checks,
and
they
were
good
for
their
face.
Tom
was
therefore
elevated
to
a
place
with
the
Judge
and
the
other
elect,
and
the
great
news
was
announced
from
headquarters.
It
was
the
most
stunning
surprise
of
the
decade,
and
so
profound
was
the
sensation
that
it
lifted
the
new
hero
up
to
the
judicial
one's
altitude,
and
the
school
had
two
marvels
to
gaze
upon
in
place
of
one.
The
boys
were
all
eaten
up
with
envy--but
those
that
suffered
the
bitterest
pangs
were
those
who
perceived
too
late
that
they
themselves
had
contributed
to
this
hated
splendor
by
trading
tickets
to
Tom
for
the
wealth
he
had
amassed
in
selling
whitewashing
privileges.
These
despised
themselves,
as
being
the
dupes
of
a
wily
fraud,
a
guileful
snake
in
the
grass.
The
prize
was
delivered
to
Tom
with
as
much
effusion
as
the
superintendent
could
pump
up
under
the
circumstances;
but
it
lacked
somewhat
of
the
true
gush,
for
the
poor
fellow's
instinct
taught
him
that
there
was
a
mystery
here
that
could
not
well
bear
the
light,
perhaps;
it
was
simply
preposterous
that
this
boy
had
warehoused
two
thousand
sheaves
of
Scriptural
wisdom
on
his
premises--a
dozen
would
strain
his
capacity,
without
a
doubt.
Amy
Lawrence
was
proud
and
glad,
and
she
tried
to
make
Tom
see
it
in
her
face--but
he
wouldn't
look.
She
wondered;
then
she
was
just
a
grain
troubled;
next
a
dim
suspicion
came
and
went--came
again;
she
watched;
a
furtive
glance
told
her
worlds--and
then
her
heart
broke,
and
she
was
jealous,
and
angry,
and
the
tears
came
and
she
hated
everybody.
Tom
most
of
all
(she
thought).
Tom
was
introduced
to
the
Judge;
but
his
tongue
was
tied,
his
breath
would
hardly
come,
his
heart
quaked--partly
because
of
the
awful
greatness
of
the
man,
but
mainly
because
he
was
her
parent.
He
would
have
liked
to
fall
down
and
worship
him,
if
it
were
in
the
dark.
The
Judge
put
his
hand
on
Tom's
head
and
called
him
a
fine
little
man,
and
asked
him
what
his
name
was.
The
boy
stammered,
gasped,
and
got
it
out:
"Tom."
"Oh,
no,
not
Tom--it
is--"
"Thomas."
"Ah,
that's
it.
I
thought
there
was
more
to
it,
maybe.
That's
very
well.
But
you've
another
one
I
daresay,
and
you'll
tell
it
to
me,
won't
you?"
"Tell
the
gentleman
your
other
name,
Thomas,"
said
Walters,
"and
say
sir.
You
mustn't
forget
your
manners."
"Thomas
Sawyer--sir."
"That's
it!
That's
a
good
boy.
Fine
boy.
Fine,
manly
little
fellow.
Two
thousand
verses
is
a
great
many--very,
very
great
many.
And
you
never
can
be
sorry
for
the
trouble
you
took
to
learn
them;
for
knowledge
is
worth
more
than
anything
there
is
in
the
world;
it's
what
makes
great
men
and
good
men;
you'll
be
a
great
man
and
a
good
man
yourself,
some
day,
Thomas,
and
then
you'll
look
back
and
say,
It's
all
owing
to
the
precious
Sunday-school
privileges
of
my
boyhood--it's
all
owing
to
my
dear
teachers
that
taught
me
to
learn--it's
all
owing
to
the
good
superintendent,
who
encouraged
me,
and
watched
over
me,
and
gave
me
a
beautiful
Bible--a
splendid
elegant
Bible--to
keep
and
have
it
all
for
my
own,
always--it's
all
owing
to
right
bringing
up!
That
is
what
you
will
say,
Thomas--and
you
wouldn't
take
any
money
for
those
two
thousand
verses--no
indeed
you
wouldn't.
And
now
you
wouldn't
mind
telling
me
and
this
lady
some
of
the
things
you've
learned--no,
I
know
you
wouldn't--for
we
are
proud
of
little
boys
that
learn.
Now,
no
doubt
you
know
the
names
of
all
the
twelve
disciples.
Won't
you
tell
us
the
names
of
the
first
two
that
were
appointed?"
Tom
was
tugging
at
a
button-hole
and
looking
sheepish.
He
blushed,
now,
and
his
eyes
fell.
Mr.
Walters'
heart
sank
within
him.
He
said
to
himself,
it
is
not
possible
that
the
boy
can
answer
the
simplest
question--why
DID
the
Judge
ask
him?
Yet
he
felt
obliged
to
speak
up
and
say:
"Answer
the
gentleman,
Thomas--don't
be
afraid."
Tom
still
hung
fire.
"Now
I
know
you'll
tell
me,"
said
the
lady.
"The
names
of
the
first
two
disciples
were--"
"DAVID
AND
GOLIAH!"
Let
us
draw
the
curtain
of
charity
over
the
rest
of
the
scene.
CHAPTER
V
ABOUT
half-past
ten
the
cracked
bell
of
the
small
church
began
to
ring,
and
presently
the
people
began
to
gather
for
the
morning
sermon.
The
Sunday-school
children
distributed
themselves
about
the
house
and
occupied
pews
with
their
parents,
so
as
to
be
under
supervision.
Aunt
Polly
came,
and
Tom
and
Sid
and
Mary
sat
with
her--Tom
being
placed
next
the
aisle,
in
order
that
he
might
be
as
far
away
from
the
open
window
and
the
seductive
outside
summer
scenes
as
possible.
The
crowd
filed
up
the
aisles:
the
aged
and
needy
postmaster,
who
had
seen
better
days;
the
mayor
and
his
wife--for
they
had
a
mayor
there,
among
other
unnecessaries;
the
justice
of
the
peace;
the
widow
Douglass,
fair,
smart,
and
forty,
a
generous,
good-hearted
soul
and
well-to-do,
her
hill
mansion
the
only
palace
in
the
town,
and
the
most
hospitable
and
much
the
most
lavish
in
the
matter
of
festivities
that
St.
Petersburg
could
boast;
the
bent
and
venerable
Major
and
Mrs.
Ward;
lawyer
Riverson,
the
new
notable
from
a
distance;
next
the
belle
of
the
village,
followed
by
a
troop
of
lawn-clad
and
ribbon-decked
young
heart-breakers;
then
all
the
young
clerks
in
town
in
a
body--for
they
had
stood
in
the
vestibule
sucking
their
cane-heads,
a
circling
wall
of
oiled
and
simpering
admirers,
till
the
last
girl
had
run
their
gantlet;
and
last
of
all
came
the
Model
Boy,
Willie
Mufferson,
taking
as
heedful
care
of
his
mother
as
if
she
were
cut
glass.
He
always
brought
his
mother
to
church,
and
was
the
pride
of
all
the
matrons.
The
boys
all
hated
him,
he
was
so
good.
And
besides,
he
had
been
"thrown
up
to
them"
so
much.
His
white
handkerchief
was
hanging
out
of
his
pocket
behind,
as
usual
on
Sundays--accidentally.
Tom
had
no
handkerchief,
and
he
looked
upon
boys
who
had
as
snobs.
The
congregation
being
fully
assembled,
now,
the
bell
rang
once
more,
to
warn
laggards
and
stragglers,
and
then
a
solemn
hush
fell
upon
the
church
which
was
only
broken
by
the
tittering
and
whispering
of
the
choir
in
the
gallery.
The
choir
always
tittered
and
whispered
all
through
service.
There
was
once
a
church
choir
that
was
not
ill-bred,
but
I
have
forgotten
where
it
was,
now.
It
was
a
great
many
years
ago,
and
I
can
scarcely
remember
anything
about
it,
but
I
think
it
was
in
some
foreign
country.
The
minister
gave
out
the
hymn,
and
read
it
through
with
a
relish,
in
a
peculiar
style
which
was
much
admired
in
that
part
of
the
country.
His
voice
began
on
a
medium
key
and
climbed
steadily
up
till
it
reached
a
certain
point,
where
it
bore
with
strong
emphasis
upon
the
topmost
word
and
then
plunged
down
as
if
from
a
spring-board:
Shall
I
be
car-ri-ed
toe
the
skies,
on
flow'ry
BEDS
of
ease,
Whilst
others
fight
to
win
the
prize,
and
sail
thro'
BLOODY
seas?
He
was
regarded
as
a
wonderful
reader.
At
church
"sociables"
he
was
always
called
upon
to
read
poetry;
and
when
he
was
through,
the
ladies
would
lift
up
their
hands
and
let
them
fall
helplessly
in
their
laps,
and
"wall"
their
eyes,
and
shake
their
heads,
as
much
as
to
say,
"Words
cannot
express
it;
it
is
too
beautiful,
TOO
beautiful
for
this
mortal
earth."
After
the
hymn
had
been
sung,
the
Rev.
Mr.
Sprague
turned
himself
into
a
bulletin-board,
and
read
off
"notices"
of
meetings
and
societies
and
things
till
it
seemed
that
the
list
would
stretch
out
to
the
crack
of
doom--a
queer
custom
which
is
still
kept
up
in
America,
even
in
cities,
away
here
in
this
age
of
abundant
newspapers.
Often,
the
less
there
is
to
justify
a
traditional
custom,
the
harder
it
is
to
get
rid
of
it.
And
now
the
minister
prayed.
A
good,
generous
prayer
it
was,
and
went
into
details:
it
pleaded
for
the
church,
and
the
little
children
of
the
church;
for
the
other
churches
of
the
village;
for
the
village
itself;
for
the
county;
for
the
State;
for
the
State
officers;
for
the
United
States;
for
the
churches
of
the
United
States;
for
Congress;
for
the
President;
for
the
officers
of
the
Government;
for
poor
sailors,
tossed
by
stormy
seas;
for
the
oppressed
millions
groaning
under
the
heel
of
European
monarchies
and
Oriental
despotisms;
for
such
as
have
the
light
and
the
good
tidings,
and
yet
have
not
eyes
to
see
nor
ears
to
hear
withal;
for
the
heathen
in
the
far
islands
of
the
sea;
and
closed
with
a
supplication
that
the
words
he
was
about
to
speak
might
find
grace
and
favor,
and
be
as
seed
sown
in
fertile
ground,
yielding
in
time
a
grateful
harvest
of
good.
Amen.
There
was
a
rustling
of
dresses,
and
the
standing
congregation
sat
down.
The
boy
whose
history
this
book
relates
did
not
enjoy
the
prayer,
he
only
endured
it--if
he
even
did
that
much.
He
was
restive
all
through
it;
he
kept
tally
of
the
details
of
the
prayer,
unconsciously
--for
he
was
not
listening,
but
he
knew
the
ground
of
old,
and
the
clergyman's
regular
route
over
it--and
when
a
little
trifle
of
new
matter
was
interlarded,
his
ear
detected
it
and
his
whole
nature
resented
it;
he
considered
additions
unfair,
and
scoundrelly.
In
the
midst
of
the
prayer
a
fly
had
lit
on
the
back
of
the
pew
in
front
of
him
and
tortured
his
spirit
by
calmly
rubbing
its
hands
together,
embracing
its
head
with
its
arms,
and
polishing
it
so
vigorously
that
it
seemed
to
almost
part
company
with
the
body,
and
the
slender
thread
of
a
neck
was
exposed
to
view;
scraping
its
wings
with
its
hind
legs
and
smoothing
them
to
its
body
as
if
they
had
been
coat-tails;
going
through
its
whole
toilet
as
tranquilly
as
if
it
knew
it
was
perfectly
safe.
As
indeed
it
was;
for
as
sorely
as
Tom's
hands
itched
to
grab
for
it
they
did
not
dare--he
believed
his
soul
would
be
instantly
destroyed
if
he
did
such
a
thing
while
the
prayer
was
going
on.
But
with
the
closing
sentence
his
hand
began
to
curve
and
steal
forward;
and
the
instant
the
"Amen"
was
out
the
fly
was
a
prisoner
of
war.
His
aunt
detected
the
act
and
made
him
let
it
go.
The
minister
gave
out
his
text
and
droned
along
monotonously
through
an
argument
that
was
so
prosy
that
many
a
head
by
and
by
began
to
nod
--and
yet
it
was
an
argument
that
dealt
in
limitless
fire
and
brimstone
and
thinned
the
predestined
elect
down
to
a
company
so
small
as
to
be
hardly
worth
the
saving.
Tom
counted
the
pages
of
the
sermon;
after
church
he
always
knew
how
many
pages
there
had
been,
but
he
seldom
knew
anything
else
about
the
discourse.
However,
this
time
he
was
really
interested
for
a
little
while.
The
minister
made
a
grand
and
moving
picture
of
the
assembling
together
of
the
world's
hosts
at
the
millennium
when
the
lion
and
the
lamb
should
lie
down
together
and
a
little
child
should
lead
them.
But
the
pathos,
the
lesson,
the
moral
of
the
great
spectacle
were
lost
upon
the
boy;
he
only
thought
of
the
conspicuousness
of
the
principal
character
before
the
on-looking
nations;
his
face
lit
with
the
thought,
and
he
said
to
himself
that
he
wished
he
could
be
that
child,
if
it
was
a
tame
lion.
Now
he
lapsed
into
suffering
again,
as
the
dry
argument
was
resumed.
Presently
he
bethought
him
of
a
treasure
he
had
and
got
it
out.
It
was
a
large
black
beetle
with
formidable
jaws--a
"pinchbug,"
he
called
it.
It
was
in
a
percussion-cap
box.
The
first
thing
the
beetle
did
was
to
take
him
by
the
finger.
A
natural
fillip
followed,
the
beetle
went
floundering
into
the
aisle
and
lit
on
its
back,
and
the
hurt
finger
went
into
the
boy's
mouth.
The
beetle
lay
there
working
its
helpless
legs,
unable
to
turn
over.
Tom
eyed
it,
and
longed
for
it;
but
it
was
safe
out
of
his
reach.
Other
people
uninterested
in
the
sermon
found
relief
in
the
beetle,
and
they
eyed
it
too.
Presently
a
vagrant
poodle
dog
came
idling
along,
sad
at
heart,
lazy
with
the
summer
softness
and
the
quiet,
weary
of
captivity,
sighing
for
change.
He
spied
the
beetle;
the
drooping
tail
lifted
and
wagged.
He
surveyed
the
prize;
walked
around
it;
smelt
at
it
from
a
safe
distance;
walked
around
it
again;
grew
bolder,
and
took
a
closer
smell;
then
lifted
his
lip
and
made
a
gingerly
snatch
at
it,
just
missing
it;
made
another,
and
another;
began
to
enjoy
the
diversion;
subsided
to
his
stomach
with
the
beetle
between
his
paws,
and
continued
his
experiments;
grew
weary
at
last,
and
then
indifferent
and
absent-minded.
His
head
nodded,
and
little
by
little
his
chin
descended
and
touched
the
enemy,
who
seized
it.
There
was
a
sharp
yelp,
a
flirt
of
the
poodle's
head,
and
the
beetle
fell
a
couple
of
yards
away,
and
lit
on
its
back
once
more.
The
neighboring
spectators
shook
with
a
gentle
inward
joy,
several
faces
went
behind
fans
and
handkerchiefs,
and
Tom
was
entirely
happy.
The
dog
looked
foolish,
and
probably
felt
so;
but
there
was
resentment
in
his
heart,
too,
and
a
craving
for
revenge.
So
he
went
to
the
beetle
and
began
a
wary
attack
on
it
again;
jumping
at
it
from
every
point
of
a
circle,
lighting
with
his
fore-paws
within
an
inch
of
the
creature,
making
even
closer
snatches
at
it
with
his
teeth,
and
jerking
his
head
till
his
ears
flapped
again.
But
he
grew
tired
once
more,
after
a
while;
tried
to
amuse
himself
with
a
fly
but
found
no
relief;
followed
an
ant
around,
with
his
nose
close
to
the
floor,
and
quickly
wearied
of
that;
yawned,
sighed,
forgot
the
beetle
entirely,
and
sat
down
on
it.
Then
there
was
a
wild
yelp
of
agony
and
the
poodle
went
sailing
up
the
aisle;
the
yelps
continued,
and
so
did
the
dog;
he
crossed
the
house
in
front
of
the
altar;
he
flew
down
the
other
aisle;
he
crossed
before
the
doors;
he
clamored
up
the
home-stretch;
his
anguish
grew
with
his
progress,
till
presently
he
was
but
a
woolly
comet
moving
in
its
orbit
with
the
gleam
and
the
speed
of
light.
At
last
the
frantic
sufferer
sheered
from
its
course,
and
sprang
into
its
master's
lap;
he
flung
it
out
of
the
window,
and
the
voice
of
distress
quickly
thinned
away
and
died
in
the
distance.
By
this
time
the
whole
church
was
red-faced
and
suffocating
with
suppressed
laughter,
and
the
sermon
had
come
to
a
dead
standstill.
The
discourse
was
resumed
presently,
but
it
went
lame
and
halting,
all
possibility
of
impressiveness
being
at
an
end;
for
even
the
gravest
sentiments
were
constantly
being
received
with
a
smothered
burst
of
unholy
mirth,
under
cover
of
some
remote
pew-back,
as
if
the
poor
parson
had
said
a
rarely
facetious
thing.
It
was
a
genuine
relief
to
the
whole
congregation
when
the
ordeal
was
over
and
the
benediction
pronounced.
Tom
Sawyer
went
home
quite
cheerful,
thinking
to
himself
that
there
was
some
satisfaction
about
divine
service
when
there
was
a
bit
of
variety
in
it.
He
had
but
one
marring
thought;
he
was
willing
that
the
dog
should
play
with
his
pinchbug,
but
he
did
not
think
it
was
upright
in
him
to
carry
it
off.
CHAPTER
VI
MONDAY
morning
found
Tom
Sawyer
miserable.
Monday
morning
always
found
him
so--because
it
began
another
week's
slow
suffering
in
school.
He
generally
began
that
day
with
wishing
he
had
had
no
intervening
holiday,
it
made
the
going
into
captivity
and
fetters
again
so
much
more
odious.
Tom
lay
thinking.
Presently
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
wished
he
was
sick;
then
he
could
stay
home
from
school.
Here
was
a
vague
possibility.
He
canvassed
his
system.
No
ailment
was
found,
and
he
investigated
again.
This
time
he
thought
he
could
detect
colicky
symptoms,
and
he
began
to
encourage
them
with
considerable
hope.
But
they
soon
grew
feeble,
and
presently
died
wholly
away.
He
reflected
further.
Suddenly
he
discovered
something.
One
of
his
upper
front
teeth
was
loose.
This
was
lucky;
he
was
about
to
begin
to
groan,
as
a
"starter,"
as
he
called
it,
when
it
occurred
to
him
that
if
he
came
into
court
with
that
argument,
his
aunt
would
pull
it
out,
and
that
would
hurt.
So
he
thought
he
would
hold
the
tooth
in
reserve
for
the
present,
and
seek
further.
Nothing
offered
for
some
little
time,
and
then
he
remembered
hearing
the
doctor
tell
about
a
certain
thing
that
laid
up
a
patient
for
two
or
three
weeks
and
threatened
to
make
him
lose
a
finger.
So
the
boy
eagerly
drew
his
sore
toe
from
under
the
sheet
and
held
it
up
for
inspection.
But
now
he
did
not
know
the
necessary
symptoms.
However,
it
seemed
well
worth
while
to
chance
it,
so
he
fell
to
groaning
with
considerable
spirit.
But
Sid
slept
on
unconscious.
Tom
groaned
louder,
and
fancied
that
he
began
to
feel
pain
in
the
toe.
No
result
from
Sid.
Tom
was
panting
with
his
exertions
by
this
time.
He
took
a
rest
and
then
swelled
himself
up
and
fetched
a
succession
of
admirable
groans.
Sid
snored
on.
Tom
was
aggravated.
He
said,
"Sid,
Sid!"
and
shook
him.
This
course
worked
well,
and
Tom
began
to
groan
again.
Sid
yawned,
stretched,
then
brought
himself
up
on
his
elbow
with
a
snort,
and
began
to
stare
at
Tom.
Tom
went
on
groaning.
Sid
said:
"Tom!
Say,
Tom!"
[No
response.]
"Here,
Tom!
TOM!
What
is
the
matter,
Tom?"
And
he
shook
him
and
looked
in
his
face
anxiously.
Tom
moaned
out:
"Oh,
don't,
Sid.
Don't
joggle
me."
"Why,
what's
the
matter,
Tom?
I
must
call
auntie."
"No--never
mind.
It'll
be
over
by
and
by,
maybe.
Don't
call
anybody."
"But
I
must!
DON'T
groan
so,
Tom,
it's
awful.
How
long
you
been
this
way?"
"Hours.
Ouch!
Oh,
don't
stir
so,
Sid,
you'll
kill
me."
"Tom,
why
didn't
you
wake
me
sooner?
Oh,
Tom,
DON'T!
It
makes
my
flesh
crawl
to
hear
you.
Tom,
what
is
the
matter?"
"I
forgive
you
everything,
Sid.
[Groan.]
Everything
you've
ever
done
to
me.
When
I'm
gone--"
"Oh,
Tom,
you
ain't
dying,
are
you?
Don't,
Tom--oh,
don't.
Maybe--"
"I
forgive
everybody,
Sid.
[Groan.]
Tell
'em
so,
Sid.
And
Sid,
you
give
my
window-sash
and
my
cat
with
one
eye
to
that
new
girl
that's
come
to
town,
and
tell
her--"
But
Sid
had
snatched
his
clothes
and
gone.
Tom
was
suffering
in
reality,
now,
so
handsomely
was
his
imagination
working,
and
so
his
groans
had
gathered
quite
a
genuine
tone.
Sid
flew
down-stairs
and
said:
"Oh,
Aunt
Polly,
come!
Tom's
dying!"
"Dying!"
"Yes'm.
Don't
wait--come
quick!"
"Rubbage!
I
don't
believe
it!"
But
she
fled
up-stairs,
nevertheless,
with
Sid
and
Mary
at
her
heels.
And
her
face
grew
white,
too,
and
her
lip
trembled.
When
she
reached
the
bedside
she
gasped
out:
"You,
Tom!
Tom,
what's
the
matter
with
you?"
"Oh,
auntie,
I'm--"
"What's
the
matter
with
you--what
is
the
matter
with
you,
child?"
"Oh,
auntie,
my
sore
toe's
mortified!"
The
old
lady
sank
down
into
a
chair
and
laughed
a
little,
then
cried
a
little,
then
did
both
together.
This
restored
her
and
she
said:
"Tom,
what
a
turn
you
did
give
me.
Now
you
shut
up
that
nonsense
and
climb
out
of
this."
The
groans
ceased
and
the
pain
vanished
from
the
toe.
The
boy
felt
a
little
foolish,
and
he
said:
"Aunt
Polly,
it
SEEMED
mortified,
and
it
hurt
so
I
never
minded
my
tooth
at
all."
"Your
tooth,
indeed!
What's
the
matter
with
your
tooth?"
"One
of
them's
loose,
and
it
aches
perfectly
awful."
"There,
there,
now,
don't
begin
that
groaning
again.
Open
your
mouth.
Well--your
tooth
IS
loose,
but
you're
not
going
to
die
about
that.
Mary,
get
me
a
silk
thread,
and
a
chunk
of
fire
out
of
the
kitchen."
Tom
said:
"Oh,
please,
auntie,
don't
pull
it
out.
It
don't
hurt
any
more.
I
wish
I
may
never
stir
if
it
does.
Please
don't,
auntie.
I
don't
want
to
stay
home
from
school."
"Oh,
you
don't,
don't
you?
So
all
this
row
was
because
you
thought
you'd
get
to
stay
home
from
school
and
go
a-fishing?
Tom,
Tom,
I
love
you
so,
and
you
seem
to
try
every
way
you
can
to
break
my
old
heart
with
your
outrageousness."
By
this
time
the
dental
instruments
were
ready.
The
old
lady
made
one
end
of
the
silk
thread
fast
to
Tom's
tooth
with
a
loop
and
tied
the
other
to
the
bedpost.
Then
she
seized
the
chunk
of
fire
and
suddenly
thrust
it
almost
into
the
boy's
face.
The
tooth
hung
dangling
by
the
bedpost,
now.
But
all
trials
bring
their
compensations.
As
Tom
wended
to
school
after
breakfast,
he
was
the
envy
of
every
boy
he
met
because
the
gap
in
his
upper
row
of
teeth
enabled
him
to
expectorate
in
a
new
and
admirable
way.
He
gathered
quite
a
following
of
lads
interested
in
the
exhibition;
and
one
that
had
cut
his
finger
and
had
been
a
centre
of
fascination
and
homage
up
to
this
time,
now
found
himself
suddenly
without
an
adherent,
and
shorn
of
his
glory.
His
heart
was
heavy,
and
he
said
with
a
disdain
which
he
did
not
feel
that
it
wasn't
anything
to
spit
like
Tom
Sawyer;
but
another
boy
said,
"Sour
grapes!"
and
he
wandered
away
a
dismantled
hero.
Shortly
Tom
came
upon
the
juvenile
pariah
of
the
village,
Huckleberry
Finn,
son
of
the
town
drunkard.
Huckleberry
was
cordially
hated
and
dreaded
by
all
the
mothers
of
the
town,
because
he
was
idle
and
lawless
and
vulgar
and
bad--and
because
all
their
children
admired
him
so,
and
delighted
in
his
forbidden
society,
and
wished
they
dared
to
be
like
him.
Tom
was
like
the
rest
of
the
respectable
boys,
in
that
he
envied
Huckleberry
his
gaudy
outcast
condition,
and
was
under
strict
orders
not
to
play
with
him.
So
he
played
with
him
every
time
he
got
a
chance.
Huckleberry
was
always
dressed
in
the
cast-off
clothes
of
full-grown
men,
and
they
were
in
perennial
bloom
and
fluttering
with
rags.
His
hat
was
a
vast
ruin
with
a
wide
crescent
lopped
out
of
its
brim;
his
coat,
when
he
wore
one,
hung
nearly
to
his
heels
and
had
the
rearward
buttons
far
down
the
back;
but
one
suspender
supported
his
trousers;
the
seat
of
the
trousers
bagged
low
and
contained
nothing,
the
fringed
legs
dragged
in
the
dirt
when
not
rolled
up.
Huckleberry
came
and
went,
at
his
own
free
will.
He
slept
on
doorsteps
in
fine
weather
and
in
empty
hogsheads
in
wet;
he
did
not
have
to
go
to
school
or
to
church,
or
call
any
being
master
or
obey
anybody;
he
could
go
fishing
or
swimming
when
and
where
he
chose,
and
stay
as
long
as
it
suited
him;
nobody
forbade
him
to
fight;
he
could
sit
up
as
late
as
he
pleased;
he
was
always
the
first
boy
that
went
barefoot
in
the
spring
and
the
last
to
resume
leather
in
the
fall;
he
never
had
to
wash,
nor
put
on
clean
clothes;
he
could
swear
wonderfully.
In
a
word,
everything
that
goes
to
make
life
precious
that
boy
had.
So
thought
every
harassed,
hampered,
respectable
boy
in
St.
Petersburg.
Tom
hailed
the
romantic
outcast:
"Hello,
Huckleberry!"
"Hello
yourself,
and
see
how
you
like
it."
"What's
that
you
got?"
"Dead
cat."
"Lemme
see
him,
Huck.
My,
he's
pretty
stiff.
Where'd
you
get
him?"
"Bought
him
off'n
a
boy."
"What
did
you
give?"
"I
give
a
blue
ticket
and
a
bladder
that
I
got
at
the
slaughter-house."
"Where'd
you
get
the
blue
ticket?"
"Bought
it
off'n
Ben
Rogers
two
weeks
ago
for
a
hoop-stick."
"Say--what
is
dead
cats
good
for,
Huck?"
"Good
for?
Cure
warts
with."
"No!
Is
that
so?
I
know
something
that's
better."
"I
bet
you
don't.
What
is
it?"
"Why,
spunk-water."
"Spunk-water!
I
wouldn't
give
a
dern
for
spunk-water."
"You
wouldn't,
wouldn't
you?
D'you
ever
try
it?"
"No,
I
hain't.
But
Bob
Tanner
did."
"Who
told
you
so!"
"Why,
he
told
Jeff
Thatcher,
and
Jeff
told
Johnny
Baker,
and
Johnny
told
Jim
Hollis,
and
Jim
told
Ben
Rogers,
and
Ben
told
a
nigger,
and
the
nigger
told
me.
There
now!"
"Well,
what
of
it?
They'll
all
lie.
Leastways
all
but
the
nigger.
I
don't
know
HIM.
But
I
never
see
a
nigger
that
WOULDN'T
lie.
Shucks!
Now
you
tell
me
how
Bob
Tanner
done
it,
Huck."
"Why,
he
took
and
dipped
his
hand
in
a
rotten
stump
where
the
rain-water
was."
"In
the
daytime?"
"Certainly."
"With
his
face
to
the
stump?"
"Yes.
Least
I
reckon
so."
"Did
he
say
anything?"
"I
don't
reckon
he
did.
I
don't
know."
"Aha!
Talk
about
trying
to
cure
warts
with
spunk-water
such
a
blame
fool
way
as
that!
Why,
that
ain't
a-going
to
do
any
good.
You
got
to
go
all
by
yourself,
to
the
middle
of
the
woods,
where
you
know
there's
a
spunk-water
stump,
and
just
as
it's
midnight
you
back
up
against
the
stump
and
jam
your
hand
in
and
say:
'Barley-corn,
barley-corn,
injun-meal
shorts,
Spunk-water,
spunk-water,
swaller
these
warts,'
and
then
walk
away
quick,
eleven
steps,
with
your
eyes
shut,
and
then
turn
around
three
times
and
walk
home
without
speaking
to
anybody.
Because
if
you
speak
the
charm's
busted."
"Well,
that
sounds
like
a
good
way;
but
that
ain't
the
way
Bob
Tanner
done."
"No,
sir,
you
can
bet
he
didn't,
becuz
he's
the
wartiest
boy
in
this
town;
and
he
wouldn't
have
a
wart
on
him
if
he'd
knowed
how
to
work
spunk-water.
I've
took
off
thousands
of
warts
off
of
my
hands
that
way,
Huck.
I
play
with
frogs
so
much
that
I've
always
got
considerable
many
warts.
Sometimes
I
take
'em
off
with
a
bean."
"Yes,
bean's
good.
I've
done
that."
"Have
you?
What's
your
way?"
"You
take
and
split
the
bean,
and
cut
the
wart
so
as
to
get
some
blood,
and
then
you
put
the
blood
on
one
piece
of
the
bean
and
take
and
dig
a
hole
and
bury
it
'bout
midnight
at
the
crossroads
in
the
dark
of
the
moon,
and
then
you
burn
up
the
rest
of
the
bean.
You
see
that
piece
that's
got
the
blood
on
it
will
keep
drawing
and
drawing,
trying
to
fetch
the
other
piece
to
it,
and
so
that
helps
the
blood
to
draw
the
wart,
and
pretty
soon
off
she
comes."
"Yes,
that's
it,
Huck--that's
it;
though
when
you're
burying
it
if
you
say
'Down
bean;
off
wart;
come
no
more
to
bother
me!'
it's
better.
That's
the
way
Joe
Harper
does,
and
he's
been
nearly
to
Coonville
and
most
everywheres.
But
say--how
do
you
cure
'em
with
dead
cats?"
"Why,
you
take
your
cat
and
go
and
get
in
the
graveyard
'long
about
midnight
when
somebody
that
was
wicked
has
been
buried;
and
when
it's
midnight
a
devil
will
come,
or
maybe
two
or
three,
but
you
can't
see
'em,
you
can
only
hear
something
like
the
wind,
or
maybe
hear
'em
talk;
and
when
they're
taking
that
feller
away,
you
heave
your
cat
after
'em
and
say,
'Devil
follow
corpse,
cat
follow
devil,
warts
follow
cat,
I'm
done
with
ye!'
That'll
fetch
ANY
wart."
"Sounds
right.
D'you
ever
try
it,
Huck?"
"No,
but
old
Mother
Hopkins
told
me."
"Well,
I
reckon
it's
so,
then.
Becuz
they
say
she's
a
witch."
"Say!
Why,
Tom,
I
KNOW
she
is.
She
witched
pap.
Pap
says
so
his
own
self.
He
come
along
one
day,
and
he
see
she
was
a-witching
him,
so
he
took
up
a
rock,
and
if
she
hadn't
dodged,
he'd
a
got
her.
Well,
that
very
night
he
rolled
off'n
a
shed
wher'
he
was
a
layin
drunk,
and
broke
his
arm."
"Why,
that's
awful.
How
did
he
know
she
was
a-witching
him?"
"Lord,
pap
can
tell,
easy.
Pap
says
when
they
keep
looking
at
you
right
stiddy,
they're
a-witching
you.
Specially
if
they
mumble.
Becuz
when
they
mumble
they're
saying
the
Lord's
Prayer
backards."
"Say,
Hucky,
when
you
going
to
try
the
cat?"
"To-night.
I
reckon
they'll
come
after
old
Hoss
Williams
to-night."
"But
they
buried
him
Saturday.
Didn't
they
get
him
Saturday
night?"
"Why,
how
you
talk!
How
could
their
charms
work
till
midnight?--and
THEN
it's
Sunday.
Devils
don't
slosh
around
much
of
a
Sunday,
I
don't
reckon."
"I
never
thought
of
that.
That's
so.
Lemme
go
with
you?"
"Of
course--if
you
ain't
afeard."
"Afeard!
'Tain't
likely.
Will
you
meow?"
"Yes--and
you
meow
back,
if
you
get
a
chance.
Last
time,
you
kep'
me
a-meowing
around
till
old
Hays
went
to
throwing
rocks
at
me
and
says
'Dern
that
cat!'
and
so
I
hove
a
brick
through
his
window--but
don't
you
tell."
"I
won't.
I
couldn't
meow
that
night,
becuz
auntie
was
watching
me,
but
I'll
meow
this
time.
Say--what's
that?"
"Nothing
but
a
tick."
"Where'd
you
get
him?"
"Out
in
the
woods."
"What'll
you
take
for
him?"
"I
don't
know.
I
don't
want
to
sell
him."
"All
right.
It's
a
mighty
small
tick,
anyway."
"Oh,
anybody
can
run
a
tick
down
that
don't
belong
to
them.
I'm
satisfied
with
it.
It's
a
good
enough
tick
for
me."
"Sho,
there's
ticks
a
plenty.
I
could
have
a
thousand
of
'em
if
I
wanted
to."
"Well,
why
don't
you?
Becuz
you
know
mighty
well
you
can't.
This
is
a
pretty
early
tick,
I
reckon.
It's
the
first
one
I've
seen
this
year."
"Say,
Huck--I'll
give
you
my
tooth
for
him."
"Less
see
it."
Tom
got
out
a
bit
of
paper
and
carefully
unrolled
it.
Huckleberry
viewed
it
wistfully.
The
temptation
was
very
strong.
At
last
he
said:
"Is
it
genuwyne?"
Tom
lifted
his
lip
and
showed
the
vacancy.
"Well,
all
right,"
said
Huckleberry,
"it's
a
trade."
Tom
enclosed
the
tick
in
the
percussion-cap
box
that
had
lately
been
the
pinchbug's
prison,
and
the
boys
separated,
each
feeling
wealthier
than
before.
When
Tom
reached
the
little
isolated
frame
schoolhouse,
he
strode
in
briskly,
with
the
manner
of
one
who
had
come
with
all
honest
speed.
He
hung
his
hat
on
a
peg
and
flung
himself
into
his
seat
with
business-like
alacrity.
The
master,
throned
on
high
in
his
great
splint-bottom
arm-chair,
was
dozing,
lulled
by
the
drowsy
hum
of
study.
The
interruption
roused
him.
"Thomas
Sawyer!"
Tom
knew
that
when
his
name
was
pronounced
in
full,
it
meant
trouble.
"Sir!"
"Come
up
here.
Now,
sir,
why
are
you
late
again,
as
usual?"
Tom
was
about
to
take
refuge
in
a
lie,
when
he
saw
two
long
tails
of
yellow
hair
hanging
down
a
back
that
he
recognized
by
the
electric
sympathy
of
love;
and
by
that
form
was
THE
ONLY
VACANT
PLACE
on
the
girls'
side
of
the
schoolhouse.
He
instantly
said:
"I
STOPPED
TO
TALK
WITH
HUCKLEBERRY
FINN!"
The
master's
pulse
stood
still,
and
he
stared
helplessly.
The
buzz
of
study
ceased.
The
pupils
wondered
if
this
foolhardy
boy
had
lost
his
mind.
The
master
said:
"You--you
did
what?"
"Stopped
to
talk
with
Huckleberry
Finn."
There
was
no
mistaking
the
words.
"Thomas
Sawyer,
this
is
the
most
astounding
confession
I
have
ever
listened
to.
No
mere
ferule
will
answer
for
this
offence.
Take
off
your
jacket."
The
master's
arm
performed
until
it
was
tired
and
the
stock
of
switches
notably
diminished.
Then
the
order
followed:
"Now,
sir,
go
and
sit
with
the
girls!
And
let
this
be
a
warning
to
you."
The
titter
that
rippled
around
the
room
appeared
to
abash
the
boy,
but
in
reality
that
result
was
caused
rather
more
by
his
worshipful
awe
of
his
unknown
idol
and
the
dread
pleasure
that
lay
in
his
high
good
fortune.
He
sat
down
upon
the
end
of
the
pine
bench
and
the
girl
hitched
herself
away
from
him
with
a
toss
of
her
head.
Nudges
and
winks
and
whispers
traversed
the
room,
but
Tom
sat
still,
with
his
arms
upon
the
long,
low
desk
before
him,
and
seemed
to
study
his
book.
By
and
by
attention
ceased
from
him,
and
the
accustomed
school
murmur
rose
upon
the
dull
air
once
more.
Presently
the
boy
began
to
steal
furtive
glances
at
the
girl.
She
observed
it,
"made
a
mouth"
at
him
and
gave
him
the
back
of
her
head
for
the
space
of
a
minute.
When
she
cautiously
faced
around
again,
a
peach
lay
before
her.
She
thrust
it
away.
Tom
gently
put
it
back.
She
thrust
it
away
again,
but
with
less
animosity.
Tom
patiently
returned
it
to
its
place.
Then
she
let
it
remain.
Tom
scrawled
on
his
slate,
"Please
take
it--I
got
more."
The
girl
glanced
at
the
words,
but
made
no
sign.
Now
the
boy
began
to
draw
something
on
the
slate,
hiding
his
work
with
his
left
hand.
For
a
time
the
girl
refused
to
notice;
but
her
human
curiosity
presently
began
to
manifest
itself
by
hardly
perceptible
signs.
The
boy
worked
on,
apparently
unconscious.
The
girl
made
a
sort
of
noncommittal
attempt
to
see,
but
the
boy
did
not
betray
that
he
was
aware
of
it.
At
last
she
gave
in
and
hesitatingly
whispered:
"Let
me
see
it."
Tom
partly
uncovered
a
dismal
caricature
of
a
house
with
two
gable
ends
to
it
and
a
corkscrew
of
smoke
issuing
from
the
chimney.
Then
the
girl's
interest
began
to
fasten
itself
upon
the
work
and
she
forgot
everything
else.
When
it
was
finished,
she
gazed
a
moment,
then
whispered:
"It's
nice--make
a
man."
The
artist
erected
a
man
in
the
front
yard,
that
resembled
a
derrick.
He
could
have
stepped
over
the
house;
but
the
girl
was
not
hypercritical;
she
was
satisfied
with
the
monster,
and
whispered:
"It's
a
beautiful
man--now
make
me
coming
along."
Tom
drew
an
hour-glass
with
a
full
moon
and
straw
limbs
to
it
and
armed
the
spreading
fingers
with
a
portentous
fan.
The
girl
said:
"It's
ever
so
nice--I
wish
I
could
draw."
"It's
easy,"
whispered
Tom,
"I'll
learn
you."
"Oh,
will
you?
When?"
"At
noon.
Do
you
go
home
to
dinner?"
"I'll
stay
if
you
will."
"Good--that's
a
whack.
What's
your
name?"
"Becky
Thatcher.
What's
yours?
Oh,
I
know.
It's
Thomas
Sawyer."
"That's
the
name
they
lick
me
by.
I'm
Tom
when
I'm
good.
You
call
me
Tom,
will
you?"
"Yes."
Now
Tom
began
to
scrawl
something
on
the
slate,
hiding
the
words
from
the
girl.
But
she
was
not
backward
this
time.
She
begged
to
see.
Tom
said:
"Oh,
it
ain't
anything."
"Yes
it
is."
"No
it
ain't.
You
don't
want
to
see."
"Yes
I
do,
indeed
I
do.
Please
let
me."
"You'll
tell."
"No
I
won't--deed
and
deed
and
double
deed
won't."
"You
won't
tell
anybody
at
all?
Ever,
as
long
as
you
live?"
"No,
I
won't
ever
tell
ANYbody.
Now
let
me."
"Oh,
YOU
don't
want
to
see!"
"Now
that
you
treat
me
so,
I
WILL
see."
And
she
put
her
small
hand
upon
his
and
a
little
scuffle
ensued,
Tom
pretending
to
resist
in
earnest
but
letting
his
hand
slip
by
degrees
till
these
words
were
revealed:
"I
LOVE
YOU."
"Oh,
you
bad
thing!"
And
she
hit
his
hand
a
smart
rap,
but
reddened
and
looked
pleased,
nevertheless.
Just
at
this
juncture
the
boy
felt
a
slow,
fateful
grip
closing
on
his
ear,
and
a
steady
lifting
impulse.
In
that
wise
he
was
borne
across
the
house
and
deposited
in
his
own
seat,
under
a
peppering
fire
of
giggles
from
the
whole
school.
Then
the
master
stood
over
him
during
a
few
awful
moments,
and
finally
moved
away
to
his
throne
without
saying
a
word.
But
although
Tom's
ear
tingled,
his
heart
was
jubilant.
As
the
school
quieted
down
Tom
made
an
honest
effort
to
study,
but
the
turmoil
within
him
was
too
great.
In
turn
he
took
his
place
in
the
reading
class
and
made
a
botch
of
it;
then
in
the
geography
class
and
turned
lakes
into
mountains,
mountains
into
rivers,
and
rivers
into
continents,
till
chaos
was
come
again;
then
in
the
spelling
class,
and
got
"turned
down,"
by
a
succession
of
mere
baby
words,
till
he
brought
up
at
the
foot
and
yielded
up
the
pewter
medal
which
he
had
worn
with
ostentation
for
months.
CHAPTER
VII
THE
harder
Tom
tried
to
fasten
his
mind
on
his
book,
the
more
his
ideas
wandered.
So
at
last,
with
a
sigh
and
a
yawn,
he
gave
it
up.
It
seemed
to
him
that
the
noon
recess
would
never
come.
The
air
was
utterly
dead.
There
was
not
a
breath
stirring.
It
was
the
sleepiest
of
sleepy
days.
The
drowsing
murmur
of
the
five
and
twenty
studying
scholars
soothed
the
soul
like
the
spell
that
is
in
the
murmur
of
bees.
Away
off
in
the
flaming
sunshine,
Cardiff
Hill
lifted
its
soft
green
sides
through
a
shimmering
veil
of
heat,
tinted
with
the
purple
of
distance;
a
few
birds
floated
on
lazy
wing
high
in
the
air;
no
other
living
thing
was
visible
but
some
cows,
and
they
were
asleep.
Tom's
heart
ached
to
be
free,
or
else
to
have
something
of
interest
to
do
to
pass
the
dreary
time.
His
hand
wandered
into
his
pocket
and
his
face
lit
up
with
a
glow
of
gratitude
that
was
prayer,
though
he
did
not
know
it.
Then
furtively
the
percussion-cap
box
came
out.
He
released
the
tick
and
put
him
on
the
long
flat
desk.
The
creature
probably
glowed
with
a
gratitude
that
amounted
to
prayer,
too,
at
this
moment,
but
it
was
premature:
for
when
he
started
thankfully
to
travel
off,
Tom
turned
him
aside
with
a
pin
and
made
him
take
a
new
direction.
Tom's
bosom
friend
sat
next
him,
suffering
just
as
Tom
had
been,
and
now
he
was
deeply
and
gratefully
interested
in
this
entertainment
in
an
instant.
This
bosom
friend
was
Joe
Harper.
The
two
boys
were
sworn
friends
all
the
week,
and
embattled
enemies
on
Saturdays.
Joe
took
a
pin
out
of
his
lapel
and
began
to
assist
in
exercising
the
prisoner.
The
sport
grew
in
interest
momently.
Soon
Tom
said
that
they
were
interfering
with
each
other,
and
neither
getting
the
fullest
benefit
of
the
tick.
So
he
put
Joe's
slate
on
the
desk
and
drew
a
line
down
the
middle
of
it
from
top
to
bottom.
"Now,"
said
he,
"as
long
as
he
is
on
your
side
you
can
stir
him
up
and
I'll
let
him
alone;
but
if
you
let
him
get
away
and
get
on
my
side,
you're
to
leave
him
alone
as
long
as
I
can
keep
him
from
crossing
over."
"All
right,
go
ahead;
start
him
up."
The
tick
escaped
from
Tom,
presently,
and
crossed
the
equator.
Joe
harassed
him
awhile,
and
then
he
got
away
and
crossed
back
again.
This
change
of
base
occurred
often.
While
one
boy
was
worrying
the
tick
with
absorbing
interest,
the
other
would
look
on
with
interest
as
strong,
the
two
heads
bowed
together
over
the
slate,
and
the
two
souls
dead
to
all
things
else.
At
last
luck
seemed
to
settle
and
abide
with
Joe.
The
tick
tried
this,
that,
and
the
other
course,
and
got
as
excited
and
as
anxious
as
the
boys
themselves,
but
time
and
again
just
as
he
would
have
victory
in
his
very
grasp,
so
to
speak,
and
Tom's
fingers
would
be
twitching
to
begin,
Joe's
pin
would
deftly
head
him
off,
and
keep
possession.
At
last
Tom
could
stand
it
no
longer.
The
temptation
was
too
strong.
So
he
reached
out
and
lent
a
hand
with
his
pin.
Joe
was
angry
in
a
moment.
Said
he:
"Tom,
you
let
him
alone."
"I
only
just
want
to
stir
him
up
a
little,
Joe."
"No,
sir,
it
ain't
fair;
you
just
let
him
alone."
"Blame
it,
I
ain't
going
to
stir
him
much."
"Let
him
alone,
I
tell
you."
"I
won't!"
"You
shall--he's
on
my
side
of
the
line."
"Look
here,
Joe
Harper,
whose
is
that
tick?"
"I
don't
care
whose
tick
he
is--he's
on
my
side
of
the
line,
and
you
sha'n't
touch
him."
"Well,
I'll
just
bet
I
will,
though.
He's
my
tick
and
I'll
do
what
I
blame
please
with
him,
or
die!"
A
tremendous
whack
came
down
on
Tom's
shoulders,
and
its
duplicate
on
Joe's;
and
for
the
space
of
two
minutes
the
dust
continued
to
fly
from
the
two
jackets
and
the
whole
school
to
enjoy
it.
The
boys
had
been
too
absorbed
to
notice
the
hush
that
had
stolen
upon
the
school
awhile
before
when
the
master
came
tiptoeing
down
the
room
and
stood
over
them.
He
had
contemplated
a
good
part
of
the
performance
before
he
contributed
his
bit
of
variety
to
it.
When
school
broke
up
at
noon,
Tom
flew
to
Becky
Thatcher,
and
whispered
in
her
ear:
"Put
on
your
bonnet
and
let
on
you're
going
home;
and
when
you
get
to
the
corner,
give
the
rest
of
'em
the
slip,
and
turn
down
through
the
lane
and
come
back.
I'll
go
the
other
way
and
come
it
over
'em
the
same
way."
So
the
one
went
off
with
one
group
of
scholars,
and
the
other
with
another.
In
a
little
while
the
two
met
at
the
bottom
of
the
lane,
and
when
they
reached
the
school
they
had
it
all
to
themselves.
Then
they
sat
together,
with
a
slate
before
them,
and
Tom
gave
Becky
the
pencil
and
held
her
hand
in
his,
guiding
it,
and
so
created
another
surprising
house.
When
the
interest
in
art
began
to
wane,
the
two
fell
to
talking.
Tom
was
swimming
in
bliss.
He
said:
"Do
you
love
rats?"
"No!
I
hate
them!"
"Well,
I
do,
too--LIVE
ones.
But
I
mean
dead
ones,
to
swing
round
your
head
with
a
string."
"No,
I
don't
care
for
rats
much,
anyway.
What
I
like
is
chewing-gum."
"Oh,
I
should
say
so!
I
wish
I
had
some
now."
"Do
you?
I've
got
some.
I'll
let
you
chew
it
awhile,
but
you
must
give
it
back
to
me."
That
was
agreeable,
so
they
chewed
it
turn
about,
and
dangled
their
legs
against
the
bench
in
excess
of
contentment.
"Was
you
ever
at
a
circus?"
said
Tom.
"Yes,
and
my
pa's
going
to
take
me
again
some
time,
if
I'm
good."
"I
been
to
the
circus
three
or
four
times--lots
of
times.
Church
ain't
shucks
to
a
circus.
There's
things
going
on
at
a
circus
all
the
time.
I'm
going
to
be
a
clown
in
a
circus
when
I
grow
up."
"Oh,
are
you!
That
will
be
nice.
They're
so
lovely,
all
spotted
up."
"Yes,
that's
so.
And
they
get
slathers
of
money--most
a
dollar
a
day,
Ben
Rogers
says.
Say,
Becky,
was
you
ever
engaged?"
"What's
that?"
"Why,
engaged
to
be
married."
"No."
"Would
you
like
to?"
"I
reckon
so.
I
don't
know.
What
is
it
like?"
"Like?
Why
it
ain't
like
anything.
You
only
just
tell
a
boy
you
won't
ever
have
anybody
but
him,
ever
ever
ever,
and
then
you
kiss
and
that's
all.
Anybody
can
do
it."
"Kiss?
What
do
you
kiss
for?"
"Why,
that,
you
know,
is
to--well,
they
always
do
that."
"Everybody?"
"Why,
yes,
everybody
that's
in
love
with
each
other.
Do
you
remember
what
I
wrote
on
the
slate?"
"Ye--yes."
"What
was
it?"
"I
sha'n't
tell
you."
"Shall
I
tell
YOU?"
"Ye--yes--but
some
other
time."
"No,
now."
"No,
not
now--to-morrow."
"Oh,
no,
NOW.
Please,
Becky--I'll
whisper
it,
I'll
whisper
it
ever
so
easy."
Becky
hesitating,
Tom
took
silence
for
consent,
and
passed
his
arm
about
her
waist
and
whispered
the
tale
ever
so
softly,
with
his
mouth
close
to
her
ear.
And
then
he
added:
"Now
you
whisper
it
to
me--just
the
same."
She
resisted,
for
a
while,
and
then
said:
"You
turn
your
face
away
so
you
can't
see,
and
then
I
will.
But
you
mustn't
ever
tell
anybody--WILL
you,
Tom?
Now
you
won't,
WILL
you?"
"No,
indeed,
indeed
I
won't.
Now,
Becky."
He
turned
his
face
away.
She
bent
timidly
around
till
her
breath
stirred
his
curls
and
whispered,
"I--love--you!"
Then
she
sprang
away
and
ran
around
and
around
the
desks
and
benches,
with
Tom
after
her,
and
took
refuge
in
a
corner
at
last,
with
her
little
white
apron
to
her
face.
Tom
clasped
her
about
her
neck
and
pleaded:
"Now,
Becky,
it's
all
done--all
over
but
the
kiss.
Don't
you
be
afraid
of
that--it
ain't
anything
at
all.
Please,
Becky."
And
he
tugged
at
her
apron
and
the
hands.
By
and
by
she
gave
up,
and
let
her
hands
drop;
her
face,
all
glowing
with
the
struggle,
came
up
and
submitted.
Tom
kissed
the
red
lips
and
said:
"Now
it's
all
done,
Becky.
And
always
after
this,
you
know,
you
ain't
ever
to
love
anybody
but
me,
and
you
ain't
ever
to
marry
anybody
but
me,
ever
never
and
forever.
Will
you?"
"No,
I'll
never
love
anybody
but
you,
Tom,
and
I'll
never
marry
anybody
but
you--and
you
ain't
to
ever
marry
anybody
but
me,
either."
"Certainly.
Of
course.
That's
PART
of
it.
And
always
coming
to
school
or
when
we're
going
home,
you're
to
walk
with
me,
when
there
ain't
anybody
looking--and
you
choose
me
and
I
choose
you
at
parties,
because
that's
the
way
you
do
when
you're
engaged."
"It's
so
nice.
I
never
heard
of
it
before."
"Oh,
it's
ever
so
gay!
Why,
me
and
Amy
Lawrence--"
The
big
eyes
told
Tom
his
blunder
and
he
stopped,
confused.
"Oh,
Tom!
Then
I
ain't
the
first
you've
ever
been
engaged
to!"
The
child
began
to
cry.
Tom
said:
"Oh,
don't
cry,
Becky,
I
don't
care
for
her
any
more."
"Yes,
you
do,
Tom--you
know
you
do."
Tom
tried
to
put
his
arm
about
her
neck,
but
she
pushed
him
away
and
turned
her
face
to
the
wall,
and
went
on
crying.
Tom
tried
again,
with
soothing
words
in
his
mouth,
and
was
repulsed
again.
Then
his
pride
was
up,
and
he
strode
away
and
went
outside.
He
stood
about,
restless
and
uneasy,
for
a
while,
glancing
at
the
door,
every
now
and
then,
hoping
she
would
repent
and
come
to
find
him.
But
she
did
not.
Then
he
began
to
feel
badly
and
fear
that
he
was
in
the
wrong.
It
was
a
hard
struggle
with
him
to
make
new
advances,
now,
but
he
nerved
himself
to
it
and
entered.
She
was
still
standing
back
there
in
the
corner,
sobbing,
with
her
face
to
the
wall.
Tom's
heart
smote
him.
He
went
to
her
and
stood
a
moment,
not
knowing
exactly
how
to
proceed.
Then
he
said
hesitatingly:
"Becky,
I--I
don't
care
for
anybody
but
you."
No
reply--but
sobs.
"Becky"--pleadingly.
"Becky,
won't
you
say
something?"
More
sobs.
Tom
got
out
his
chiefest
jewel,
a
brass
knob
from
the
top
of
an
andiron,
and
passed
it
around
her
so
that
she
could
see
it,
and
said:
"Please,
Becky,
won't
you
take
it?"
She
struck
it
to
the
floor.
Then
Tom
marched
out
of
the
house
and
over
the
hills
and
far
away,
to
return
to
school
no
more
that
day.
Presently
Becky
began
to
suspect.
She
ran
to
the
door;
he
was
not
in
sight;
she
flew
around
to
the
play-yard;
he
was
not
there.
Then
she
called:
"Tom!
Come
back,
Tom!"
She
listened
intently,
but
there
was
no
answer.
She
had
no
companions
but
silence
and
loneliness.
So
she
sat
down
to
cry
again
and
upbraid
herself;
and
by
this
time
the
scholars
began
to
gather
again,
and
she
had
to
hide
her
griefs
and
still
her
broken
heart
and
take
up
the
cross
of
a
long,
dreary,
aching
afternoon,
with
none
among
the
strangers
about
her
to
exchange
sorrows
with.
CHAPTER
VIII
TOM
dodged
hither
and
thither
through
lanes
until
he
was
well
out
of
the
track
of
returning
scholars,
and
then
fell
into
a
moody
jog.
He
crossed
a
small
"branch"
two
or
three
times,
because
of
a
prevailing
juvenile
superstition
that
to
cross
water
baffled
pursuit.
Half
an
hour
later
he
was
disappearing
behind
the
Douglas
mansion
on
the
summit
of
Cardiff
Hill,
and
the
schoolhouse
was
hardly
distinguishable
away
off
in
the
valley
behind
him.
He
entered
a
dense
wood,
picked
his
pathless
way
to
the
centre
of
it,
and
sat
down
on
a
mossy
spot
under
a
spreading
oak.
There
was
not
even
a
zephyr
stirring;
the
dead
noonday
heat
had
even
stilled
the
songs
of
the
birds;
nature
lay
in
a
trance
that
was
broken
by
no
sound
but
the
occasional
far-off
hammering
of
a
woodpecker,
and
this
seemed
to
render
the
pervading
silence
and
sense
of
loneliness
the
more
profound.
The
boy's
soul
was
steeped
in
melancholy;
his
feelings
were
in
happy
accord
with
his
surroundings.
He
sat
long
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
chin
in
his
hands,
meditating.
It
seemed
to
him
that
life
was
but
a
trouble,
at
best,
and
he
more
than
half
envied
Jimmy
Hodges,
so
lately
released;
it
must
be
very
peaceful,
he
thought,
to
lie
and
slumber
and
dream
forever
and
ever,
with
the
wind
whispering
through
the
trees
and
caressing
the
grass
and
the
flowers
over
the
grave,
and
nothing
to
bother
and
grieve
about,
ever
any
more.
If
he
only
had
a
clean
Sunday-school
record
he
could
be
willing
to
go,
and
be
done
with
it
all.
Now
as
to
this
girl.
What
had
he
done?
Nothing.
He
had
meant
the
best
in
the
world,
and
been
treated
like
a
dog--like
a
very
dog.
She
would
be
sorry
some
day--maybe
when
it
was
too
late.
Ah,
if
he
could
only
die
TEMPORARILY!
But
the
elastic
heart
of
youth
cannot
be
compressed
into
one
constrained
shape
long
at
a
time.
Tom
presently
began
to
drift
insensibly
back
into
the
concerns
of
this
life
again.
What
if
he
turned
his
back,
now,
and
disappeared
mysteriously?
What
if
he
went
away--ever
so
far
away,
into
unknown
countries
beyond
the
seas--and
never
came
back
any
more!
How
would
she
feel
then!
The
idea
of
being
a
clown
recurred
to
him
now,
only
to
fill
him
with
disgust.
For
frivolity
and
jokes
and
spotted
tights
were
an
offense,
when
they
intruded
themselves
upon
a
spirit
that
was
exalted
into
the
vague
august
realm
of
the
romantic.
No,
he
would
be
a
soldier,
and
return
after
long
years,
all
war-worn
and
illustrious.
No--better
still,
he
would
join
the
Indians,
and
hunt
buffaloes
and
go
on
the
warpath
in
the
mountain
ranges
and
the
trackless
great
plains
of
the
Far
West,
and
away
in
the
future
come
back
a
great
chief,
bristling
with
feathers,
hideous
with
paint,
and
prance
into
Sunday-school,
some
drowsy
summer
morning,
with
a
bloodcurdling
war-whoop,
and
sear
the
eyeballs
of
all
his
companions
with
unappeasable
envy.
But
no,
there
was
something
gaudier
even
than
this.
He
would
be
a
pirate!
That
was
it!
NOW
his
future
lay
plain
before
him,
and
glowing
with
unimaginable
splendor.
How
his
name
would
fill
the
world,
and
make
people
shudder!
How
gloriously
he
would
go
plowing
the
dancing
seas,
in
his
long,
low,
black-hulled
racer,
the
Spirit
of
the
Storm,
with
his
grisly
flag
flying
at
the
fore!
And
at
the
zenith
of
his
fame,
how
he
would
suddenly
appear
at
the
old
village
and
stalk
into
church,
brown
and
weather-beaten,
in
his
black
velvet
doublet
and
trunks,
his
great
jack-boots,
his
crimson
sash,
his
belt
bristling
with
horse-pistols,
his
crime-rusted
cutlass
at
his
side,
his
slouch
hat
with
waving
plumes,
his
black
flag
unfurled,
with
the
skull
and
crossbones
on
it,
and
hear
with
swelling
ecstasy
the
whisperings,
"It's
Tom
Sawyer
the
Pirate!--the
Black
Avenger
of
the
Spanish
Main!"
Yes,
it
was
settled;
his
career
was
determined.
He
would
run
away
from
home
and
enter
upon
it.
He
would
start
the
very
next
morning.
Therefore
he
must
now
begin
to
get
ready.
He
would
collect
his
resources
together.
He
went
to
a
rotten
log
near
at
hand
and
began
to
dig
under
one
end
of
it
with
his
Barlow
knife.
He
soon
struck
wood
that
sounded
hollow.
He
put
his
hand
there
and
uttered
this
incantation
impressively:
"What
hasn't
come
here,
come!
What's
here,
stay
here!"
Then
he
scraped
away
the
dirt,
and
exposed
a
pine
shingle.
He
took
it
up
and
disclosed
a
shapely
little
treasure-house
whose
bottom
and
sides
were
of
shingles.
In
it
lay
a
marble.
Tom's
astonishment
was
boundless!
He
scratched
his
head
with
a
perplexed
air,
and
said:
"Well,
that
beats
anything!"
Then
he
tossed
the
marble
away
pettishly,
and
stood
cogitating.
The
truth
was,
that
a
superstition
of
his
had
failed,
here,
which
he
and
all
his
comrades
had
always
looked
upon
as
infallible.
If
you
buried
a
marble
with
certain
necessary
incantations,
and
left
it
alone
a
fortnight,
and
then
opened
the
place
with
the
incantation
he
had
just
used,
you
would
find
that
all
the
marbles
you
had
ever
lost
had
gathered
themselves
together
there,
meantime,
no
matter
how
widely
they
had
been
separated.
But
now,
this
thing
had
actually
and
unquestionably
failed.
Tom's
whole
structure
of
faith
was
shaken
to
its
foundations.
He
had
many
a
time
heard
of
this
thing
succeeding
but
never
of
its
failing
before.
It
did
not
occur
to
him
that
he
had
tried
it
several
times
before,
himself,
but
could
never
find
the
hiding-places
afterward.
He
puzzled
over
the
matter
some
time,
and
finally
decided
that
some
witch
had
interfered
and
broken
the
charm.
He
thought
he
would
satisfy
himself
on
that
point;
so
he
searched
around
till
he
found
a
small
sandy
spot
with
a
little
funnel-shaped
depression
in
it.
He
laid
himself
down
and
put
his
mouth
close
to
this
depression
and
called--
"Doodle-bug,
doodle-bug,
tell
me
what
I
want
to
know!
Doodle-bug,
doodle-bug,
tell
me
what
I
want
to
know!"
The
sand
began
to
work,
and
presently
a
small
black
bug
appeared
for
a
second
and
then
darted
under
again
in
a
fright.
"He
dasn't
tell!
So
it
WAS
a
witch
that
done
it.
I
just
knowed
it."
He
well
knew
the
futility
of
trying
to
contend
against
witches,
so
he
gave
up
discouraged.
But
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
as
well
have
the
marble
he
had
just
thrown
away,
and
therefore
he
went
and
made
a
patient
search
for
it.
But
he
could
not
find
it.
Now
he
went
back
to
his
treasure-house
and
carefully
placed
himself
just
as
he
had
been
standing
when
he
tossed
the
marble
away;
then
he
took
another
marble
from
his
pocket
and
tossed
it
in
the
same
way,
saying:
"Brother,
go
find
your
brother!"
He
watched
where
it
stopped,
and
went
there
and
looked.
But
it
must
have
fallen
short
or
gone
too
far;
so
he
tried
twice
more.
The
last
repetition
was
successful.
The
two
marbles
lay
within
a
foot
of
each
other.
Just
here
the
blast
of
a
toy
tin
trumpet
came
faintly
down
the
green
aisles
of
the
forest.
Tom
flung
off
his
jacket
and
trousers,
turned
a
suspender
into
a
belt,
raked
away
some
brush
behind
the
rotten
log,
disclosing
a
rude
bow
and
arrow,
a
lath
sword
and
a
tin
trumpet,
and
in
a
moment
had
seized
these
things
and
bounded
away,
barelegged,
with
fluttering
shirt.
He
presently
halted
under
a
great
elm,
blew
an
answering
blast,
and
then
began
to
tiptoe
and
look
warily
out,
this
way
and
that.
He
said
cautiously--to
an
imaginary
company:
"Hold,
my
merry
men!
Keep
hid
till
I
blow."
Now
appeared
Joe
Harper,
as
airily
clad
and
elaborately
armed
as
Tom.
Tom
called:
"Hold!
Who
comes
here
into
Sherwood
Forest
without
my
pass?"
"Guy
of
Guisborne
wants
no
man's
pass.
Who
art
thou
that--that--"
"Dares
to
hold
such
language,"
said
Tom,
prompting--for
they
talked
"by
the
book,"
from
memory.
"Who
art
thou
that
dares
to
hold
such
language?"
"I,
indeed!
I
am
Robin
Hood,
as
thy
caitiff
carcase
soon
shall
know."
"Then
art
thou
indeed
that
famous
outlaw?
Right
gladly
will
I
dispute
with
thee
the
passes
of
the
merry
wood.
Have
at
thee!"
They
took
their
lath
swords,
dumped
their
other
traps
on
the
ground,
struck
a
fencing
attitude,
foot
to
foot,
and
began
a
grave,
careful
combat,
"two
up
and
two
down."
Presently
Tom
said:
"Now,
if
you've
got
the
hang,
go
it
lively!"
So
they
"went
it
lively,"
panting
and
perspiring
with
the
work.
By
and
by
Tom
shouted:
"Fall!
fall!
Why
don't
you
fall?"
"I
sha'n't!
Why
don't
you
fall
yourself?
You're
getting
the
worst
of
it."
"Why,
that
ain't
anything.
I
can't
fall;
that
ain't
the
way
it
is
in
the
book.
The
book
says,
'Then
with
one
back-handed
stroke
he
slew
poor
Guy
of
Guisborne.'
You're
to
turn
around
and
let
me
hit
you
in
the
back."
There
was
no
getting
around
the
authorities,
so
Joe
turned,
received
the
whack
and
fell.
"Now,"
said
Joe,
getting
up,
"you
got
to
let
me
kill
YOU.
That's
fair."
"Why,
I
can't
do
that,
it
ain't
in
the
book."
"Well,
it's
blamed
mean--that's
all."
"Well,
say,
Joe,
you
can
be
Friar
Tuck
or
Much
the
miller's
son,
and
lam
me
with
a
quarter-staff;
or
I'll
be
the
Sheriff
of
Nottingham
and
you
be
Robin
Hood
a
little
while
and
kill
me."
This
was
satisfactory,
and
so
these
adventures
were
carried
out.
Then
Tom
became
Robin
Hood
again,
and
was
allowed
by
the
treacherous
nun
to
bleed
his
strength
away
through
his
neglected
wound.
And
at
last
Joe,
representing
a
whole
tribe
of
weeping
outlaws,
dragged
him
sadly
forth,
gave
his
bow
into
his
feeble
hands,
and
Tom
said,
"Where
this
arrow
falls,
there
bury
poor
Robin
Hood
under
the
greenwood
tree."
Then
he
shot
the
arrow
and
fell
back
and
would
have
died,
but
he
lit
on
a
nettle
and
sprang
up
too
gaily
for
a
corpse.
The
boys
dressed
themselves,
hid
their
accoutrements,
and
went
off
grieving
that
there
were
no
outlaws
any
more,
and
wondering
what
modern
civilization
could
claim
to
have
done
to
compensate
for
their
loss.
They
said
they
would
rather
be
outlaws
a
year
in
Sherwood
Forest
than
President
of
the
United
States
forever.
CHAPTER
IX
AT
half-past
nine,
that
night,
Tom
and
Sid
were
sent
to
bed,
as
usual.
They
said
their
prayers,
and
Sid
was
soon
asleep.
Tom
lay
awake
and
waited,
in
restless
impatience.
When
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
must
be
nearly
daylight,
he
heard
the
clock
strike
ten!
This
was
despair.
He
would
have
tossed
and
fidgeted,
as
his
nerves
demanded,
but
he
was
afraid
he
might
wake
Sid.
So
he
lay
still,
and
stared
up
into
the
dark.
Everything
was
dismally
still.
By
and
by,
out
of
the
stillness,
little,
scarcely
perceptible
noises
began
to
emphasize
themselves.
The
ticking
of
the
clock
began
to
bring
itself
into
notice.
Old
beams
began
to
crack
mysteriously.
The
stairs
creaked
faintly.
Evidently
spirits
were
abroad.
A
measured,
muffled
snore
issued
from
Aunt
Polly's
chamber.
And
now
the
tiresome
chirping
of
a
cricket
that
no
human
ingenuity
could
locate,
began.
Next
the
ghastly
ticking
of
a
deathwatch
in
the
wall
at
the
bed's
head
made
Tom
shudder--it
meant
that
somebody's
days
were
numbered.
Then
the
howl
of
a
far-off
dog
rose
on
the
night
air,
and
was
answered
by
a
fainter
howl
from
a
remoter
distance.
Tom
was
in
an
agony.
At
last
he
was
satisfied
that
time
had
ceased
and
eternity
begun;
he
began
to
doze,
in
spite
of
himself;
the
clock
chimed
eleven,
but
he
did
not
hear
it.
And
then
there
came,
mingling
with
his
half-formed
dreams,
a
most
melancholy
caterwauling.
The
raising
of
a
neighboring
window
disturbed
him.
A
cry
of
"Scat!
you
devil!"
and
the
crash
of
an
empty
bottle
against
the
back
of
his
aunt's
woodshed
brought
him
wide
awake,
and
a
single
minute
later
he
was
dressed
and
out
of
the
window
and
creeping
along
the
roof
of
the
"ell"
on
all
fours.
He
"meow'd"
with
caution
once
or
twice,
as
he
went;
then
jumped
to
the
roof
of
the
woodshed
and
thence
to
the
ground.
Huckleberry
Finn
was
there,
with
his
dead
cat.
The
boys
moved
off
and
disappeared
in
the
gloom.
At
the
end
of
half
an
hour
they
were
wading
through
the
tall
grass
of
the
graveyard.
It
was
a
graveyard
of
the
old-fashioned
Western
kind.
It
was
on
a
hill,
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
village.
It
had
a
crazy
board
fence
around
it,
which
leaned
inward
in
places,
and
outward
the
rest
of
the
time,
but
stood
upright
nowhere.
Grass
and
weeds
grew
rank
over
the
whole
cemetery.
All
the
old
graves
were
sunken
in,
there
was
not
a
tombstone
on
the
place;
round-topped,
worm-eaten
boards
staggered
over
the
graves,
leaning
for
support
and
finding
none.
"Sacred
to
the
memory
of"
So-and-So
had
been
painted
on
them
once,
but
it
could
no
longer
have
been
read,
on
the
most
of
them,
now,
even
if
there
had
been
light.
A
faint
wind
moaned
through
the
trees,
and
Tom
feared
it
might
be
the
spirits
of
the
dead,
complaining
at
being
disturbed.
The
boys
talked
little,
and
only
under
their
breath,
for
the
time
and
the
place
and
the
pervading
solemnity
and
silence
oppressed
their
spirits.
They
found
the
sharp
new
heap
they
were
seeking,
and
ensconced
themselves
within
the
protection
of
three
great
elms
that
grew
in
a
bunch
within
a
few
feet
of
the
grave.
Then
they
waited
in
silence
for
what
seemed
a
long
time.
The
hooting
of
a
distant
owl
was
all
the
sound
that
troubled
the
dead
stillness.
Tom's
reflections
grew
oppressive.
He
must
force
some
talk.
So
he
said
in
a
whisper:
"Hucky,
do
you
believe
the
dead
people
like
it
for
us
to
be
here?"
Huckleberry
whispered:
"I
wisht
I
knowed.
It's
awful
solemn
like,
AIN'T
it?"
"I
bet
it
is."
There
was
a
considerable
pause,
while
the
boys
canvassed
this
matter
inwardly.
Then
Tom
whispered:
"Say,
Hucky--do
you
reckon
Hoss
Williams
hears
us
talking?"
"O'
course
he
does.
Least
his
sperrit
does."
Tom,
after
a
pause:
"I
wish
I'd
said
Mister
Williams.
But
I
never
meant
any
harm.
Everybody
calls
him
Hoss."
"A
body
can't
be
too
partic'lar
how
they
talk
'bout
these-yer
dead
people,
Tom."
This
was
a
damper,
and
conversation
died
again.
Presently
Tom
seized
his
comrade's
arm
and
said:
"Sh!"
"What
is
it,
Tom?"
And
the
two
clung
together
with
beating
hearts.
"Sh!
There
'tis
again!
Didn't
you
hear
it?"
"I--"
"There!
Now
you
hear
it."
"Lord,
Tom,
they're
coming!
They're
coming,
sure.
What'll
we
do?"
"I
dono.
Think
they'll
see
us?"
"Oh,
Tom,
they
can
see
in
the
dark,
same
as
cats.
I
wisht
I
hadn't
come."
"Oh,
don't
be
afeard.
I
don't
believe
they'll
bother
us.
We
ain't
doing
any
harm.
If
we
keep
perfectly
still,
maybe
they
won't
notice
us
at
all."
"I'll
try
to,
Tom,
but,
Lord,
I'm
all
of
a
shiver."
"Listen!"
The
boys
bent
their
heads
together
and
scarcely
breathed.
A
muffled
sound
of
voices
floated
up
from
the
far
end
of
the
graveyard.
"Look!
See
there!"
whispered
Tom.
"What
is
it?"
"It's
devil-fire.
Oh,
Tom,
this
is
awful."
Some
vague
figures
approached
through
the
gloom,
swinging
an
old-fashioned
tin
lantern
that
freckled
the
ground
with
innumerable
little
spangles
of
light.
Presently
Huckleberry
whispered
with
a
shudder:
"It's
the
devils
sure
enough.
Three
of
'em!
Lordy,
Tom,
we're
goners!
Can
you
pray?"
"I'll
try,
but
don't
you
be
afeard.
They
ain't
going
to
hurt
us.
'Now
I
lay
me
down
to
sleep,
I--'"
"Sh!"
"What
is
it,
Huck?"
"They're
HUMANS!
One
of
'em
is,
anyway.
One
of
'em's
old
Muff
Potter's
voice."
"No--'tain't
so,
is
it?"
"I
bet
I
know
it.
Don't
you
stir
nor
budge.
He
ain't
sharp
enough
to
notice
us.
Drunk,
the
same
as
usual,
likely--blamed
old
rip!"
"All
right,
I'll
keep
still.
Now
they're
stuck.
Can't
find
it.
Here
they
come
again.
Now
they're
hot.
Cold
again.
Hot
again.
Red
hot!
They're
p'inted
right,
this
time.
Say,
Huck,
I
know
another
o'
them
voices;
it's
Injun
Joe."
"That's
so--that
murderin'
half-breed!
I'd
druther
they
was
devils
a
dern
sight.
What
kin
they
be
up
to?"
The
whisper
died
wholly
out,
now,
for
the
three
men
had
reached
the
grave
and
stood
within
a
few
feet
of
the
boys'
hiding-place.
"Here
it
is,"
said
the
third
voice;
and
the
owner
of
it
held
the
lantern
up
and
revealed
the
face
of
young
Doctor
Robinson.
Potter
and
Injun
Joe
were
carrying
a
handbarrow
with
a
rope
and
a
couple
of
shovels
on
it.
They
cast
down
their
load
and
began
to
open
the
grave.
The
doctor
put
the
lantern
at
the
head
of
the
grave
and
came
and
sat
down
with
his
back
against
one
of
the
elm
trees.
He
was
so
close
the
boys
could
have
touched
him.
"Hurry,
men!"
he
said,
in
a
low
voice;
"the
moon
might
come
out
at
any
moment."
They
growled
a
response
and
went
on
digging.
For
some
time
there
was
no
noise
but
the
grating
sound
of
the
spades
discharging
their
freight
of
mould
and
gravel.
It
was
very
monotonous.
Finally
a
spade
struck
upon
the
coffin
with
a
dull
woody
accent,
and
within
another
minute
or
two
the
men
had
hoisted
it
out
on
the
ground.
They
pried
off
the
lid
with
their
shovels,
got
out
the
body
and
dumped
it
rudely
on
the
ground.
The
moon
drifted
from
behind
the
clouds
and
exposed
the
pallid
face.
The
barrow
was
got
ready
and
the
corpse
placed
on
it,
covered
with
a
blanket,
and
bound
to
its
place
with
the
rope.
Potter
took
out
a
large
spring-knife
and
cut
off
the
dangling
end
of
the
rope
and
then
said:
"Now
the
cussed
thing's
ready,
Sawbones,
and
you'll
just
out
with
another
five,
or
here
she
stays."
"That's
the
talk!"
said
Injun
Joe.
"Look
here,
what
does
this
mean?"
said
the
doctor.
"You
required
your
pay
in
advance,
and
I've
paid
you."
"Yes,
and
you
done
more
than
that,"
said
Injun
Joe,
approaching
the
doctor,
who
was
now
standing.
"Five
years
ago
you
drove
me
away
from
your
father's
kitchen
one
night,
when
I
come
to
ask
for
something
to
eat,
and
you
said
I
warn't
there
for
any
good;
and
when
I
swore
I'd
get
even
with
you
if
it
took
a
hundred
years,
your
father
had
me
jailed
for
a
vagrant.
Did
you
think
I'd
forget?
The
Injun
blood
ain't
in
me
for
nothing.
And
now
I've
GOT
you,
and
you
got
to
SETTLE,
you
know!"
He
was
threatening
the
doctor,
with
his
fist
in
his
face,
by
this
time.
The
doctor
struck
out
suddenly
and
stretched
the
ruffian
on
the
ground.
Potter
dropped
his
knife,
and
exclaimed:
"Here,
now,
don't
you
hit
my
pard!"
and
the
next
moment
he
had
grappled
with
the
doctor
and
the
two
were
struggling
with
might
and
main,
trampling
the
grass
and
tearing
the
ground
with
their
heels.
Injun
Joe
sprang
to
his
feet,
his
eyes
flaming
with
passion,
snatched
up
Potter's
knife,
and
went
creeping,
catlike
and
stooping,
round
and
round
about
the
combatants,
seeking
an
opportunity.
All
at
once
the
doctor
flung
himself
free,
seized
the
heavy
headboard
of
Williams'
grave
and
felled
Potter
to
the
earth
with
it--and
in
the
same
instant
the
half-breed
saw
his
chance
and
drove
the
knife
to
the
hilt
in
the
young
man's
breast.
He
reeled
and
fell
partly
upon
Potter,
flooding
him
with
his
blood,
and
in
the
same
moment
the
clouds
blotted
out
the
dreadful
spectacle
and
the
two
frightened
boys
went
speeding
away
in
the
dark.
Presently,
when
the
moon
emerged
again,
Injun
Joe
was
standing
over
the
two
forms,
contemplating
them.
The
doctor
murmured
inarticulately,
gave
a
long
gasp
or
two
and
was
still.
The
half-breed
muttered:
"THAT
score
is
settled--damn
you."
Then
he
robbed
the
body.
After
which
he
put
the
fatal
knife
in
Potter's
open
right
hand,
and
sat
down
on
the
dismantled
coffin.
Three
--four--five
minutes
passed,
and
then
Potter
began
to
stir
and
moan.
His
hand
closed
upon
the
knife;
he
raised
it,
glanced
at
it,
and
let
it
fall,
with
a
shudder.
Then
he
sat
up,
pushing
the
body
from
him,
and
gazed
at
it,
and
then
around
him,
confusedly.
His
eyes
met
Joe's.
"Lord,
how
is
this,
Joe?"
he
said.
"It's
a
dirty
business,"
said
Joe,
without
moving.
"What
did
you
do
it
for?"
"I!
I
never
done
it!"
"Look
here!
That
kind
of
talk
won't
wash."
Potter
trembled
and
grew
white.
"I
thought
I'd
got
sober.
I'd
no
business
to
drink
to-night.
But
it's
in
my
head
yet--worse'n
when
we
started
here.
I'm
all
in
a
muddle;
can't
recollect
anything
of
it,
hardly.
Tell
me,
Joe--HONEST,
now,
old
feller--did
I
do
it?
Joe,
I
never
meant
to--'pon
my
soul
and
honor,
I
never
meant
to,
Joe.
Tell
me
how
it
was,
Joe.
Oh,
it's
awful--and
him
so
young
and
promising."
"Why,
you
two
was
scuffling,
and
he
fetched
you
one
with
the
headboard
and
you
fell
flat;
and
then
up
you
come,
all
reeling
and
staggering
like,
and
snatched
the
knife
and
jammed
it
into
him,
just
as
he
fetched
you
another
awful
clip--and
here
you've
laid,
as
dead
as
a
wedge
til
now."
"Oh,
I
didn't
know
what
I
was
a-doing.
I
wish
I
may
die
this
minute
if
I
did.
It
was
all
on
account
of
the
whiskey
and
the
excitement,
I
reckon.
I
never
used
a
weepon
in
my
life
before,
Joe.
I've
fought,
but
never
with
weepons.
They'll
all
say
that.
Joe,
don't
tell!
Say
you
won't
tell,
Joe--that's
a
good
feller.
I
always
liked
you,
Joe,
and
stood
up
for
you,
too.
Don't
you
remember?
You
WON'T
tell,
WILL
you,
Joe?"
And
the
poor
creature
dropped
on
his
knees
before
the
stolid
murderer,
and
clasped
his
appealing
hands.
"No,
you've
always
been
fair
and
square
with
me,
Muff
Potter,
and
I
won't
go
back
on
you.
There,
now,
that's
as
fair
as
a
man
can
say."
"Oh,
Joe,
you're
an
angel.
I'll
bless
you
for
this
the
longest
day
I
live."
And
Potter
began
to
cry.
"Come,
now,
that's
enough
of
that.
This
ain't
any
time
for
blubbering.
You
be
off
yonder
way
and
I'll
go
this.
Move,
now,
and
don't
leave
any
tracks
behind
you."
Potter
started
on
a
trot
that
quickly
increased
to
a
run.
The
half-breed
stood
looking
after
him.
He
muttered:
"If
he's
as
much
stunned
with
the
lick
and
fuddled
with
the
rum
as
he
had
the
look
of
being,
he
won't
think
of
the
knife
till
he's
gone
so
far
he'll
be
afraid
to
come
back
after
it
to
such
a
place
by
himself
--chicken-heart!"
Two
or
three
minutes
later
the
murdered
man,
the
blanketed
corpse,
the
lidless
coffin,
and
the
open
grave
were
under
no
inspection
but
the
moon's.
The
stillness
was
complete
again,
too.
CHAPTER
X
THE
two
boys
flew
on
and
on,
toward
the
village,
speechless
with
horror.
They
glanced
backward
over
their
shoulders
from
time
to
time,
apprehensively,
as
if
they
feared
they
might
be
followed.
Every
stump
that
started
up
in
their
path
seemed
a
man
and
an
enemy,
and
made
them
catch
their
breath;
and
as
they
sped
by
some
outlying
cottages
that
lay
near
the
village,
the
barking
of
the
aroused
watch-dogs
seemed
to
give
wings
to
their
feet.
"If
we
can
only
get
to
the
old
tannery
before
we
break
down!"
whispered
Tom,
in
short
catches
between
breaths.
"I
can't
stand
it
much
longer."
Huckleberry's
hard
pantings
were
his
only
reply,
and
the
boys
fixed
their
eyes
on
the
goal
of
their
hopes
and
bent
to
their
work
to
win
it.
They
gained
steadily
on
it,
and
at
last,
breast
to
breast,
they
burst
through
the
open
door
and
fell
grateful
and
exhausted
in
the
sheltering
shadows
beyond.
By
and
by
their
pulses
slowed
down,
and
Tom
whispered:
"Huckleberry,
what
do
you
reckon'll
come
of
this?"
"If
Doctor
Robinson
dies,
I
reckon
hanging'll
come
of
it."
"Do
you
though?"
"Why,
I
KNOW
it,
Tom."
Tom
thought
a
while,
then
he
said:
"Who'll
tell?
We?"
"What
are
you
talking
about?
S'pose
something
happened
and
Injun
Joe
DIDN'T
hang?
Why,
he'd
kill
us
some
time
or
other,
just
as
dead
sure
as
we're
a
laying
here."
"That's
just
what
I
was
thinking
to
myself,
Huck."
"If
anybody
tells,
let
Muff
Potter
do
it,
if
he's
fool
enough.
He's
generally
drunk
enough."
Tom
said
nothing--went
on
thinking.
Presently
he
whispered:
"Huck,
Muff
Potter
don't
know
it.
How
can
he
tell?"
"What's
the
reason
he
don't
know
it?"
"Because
he'd
just
got
that
whack
when
Injun
Joe
done
it.
D'you
reckon
he
could
see
anything?
D'you
reckon
he
knowed
anything?"
"By
hokey,
that's
so,
Tom!"
"And
besides,
look-a-here--maybe
that
whack
done
for
HIM!"
"No,
'taint
likely,
Tom.
He
had
liquor
in
him;
I
could
see
that;
and
besides,
he
always
has.
Well,
when
pap's
full,
you
might
take
and
belt
him
over
the
head
with
a
church
and
you
couldn't
phase
him.
He
says
so,
his
own
self.
So
it's
the
same
with
Muff
Potter,
of
course.
But
if
a
man
was
dead
sober,
I
reckon
maybe
that
whack
might
fetch
him;
I
dono."
After
another
reflective
silence,
Tom
said:
"Hucky,
you
sure
you
can
keep
mum?"
"Tom,
we
GOT
to
keep
mum.
You
know
that.
That
Injun
devil
wouldn't
make
any
more
of
drownding
us
than
a
couple
of
cats,
if
we
was
to
squeak
'bout
this
and
they
didn't
hang
him.
Now,
look-a-here,
Tom,
less
take
and
swear
to
one
another--that's
what
we
got
to
do--swear
to
keep
mum."
"I'm
agreed.
It's
the
best
thing.
Would
you
just
hold
hands
and
swear
that
we--"
"Oh
no,
that
wouldn't
do
for
this.
That's
good
enough
for
little
rubbishy
common
things--specially
with
gals,
cuz
THEY
go
back
on
you
anyway,
and
blab
if
they
get
in
a
huff--but
there
orter
be
writing
'bout
a
big
thing
like
this.
And
blood."
Tom's
whole
being
applauded
this
idea.
It
was
deep,
and
dark,
and
awful;
the
hour,
the
circumstances,
the
surroundings,
were
in
keeping
with
it.
He
picked
up
a
clean
pine
shingle
that
lay
in
the
moonlight,
took
a
little
fragment
of
"red
keel"
out
of
his
pocket,
got
the
moon
on
his
work,
and
painfully
scrawled
these
lines,
emphasizing
each
slow
down-stroke
by
clamping
his
tongue
between
his
teeth,
and
letting
up
the
pressure
on
the
up-strokes.
[See
next
page.]
"Huck
Finn
and
Tom
Sawyer
swears
they
will
keep
mum
about
This
and
They
wish
They
may
Drop
down
dead
in
Their
Tracks
if
They
ever
Tell
and
Rot."
Huckleberry
was
filled
with
admiration
of
Tom's
facility
in
writing,
and
the
sublimity
of
his
language.
He
at
once
took
a
pin
from
his
lapel
and
was
going
to
prick
his
flesh,
but
Tom
said:
"Hold
on!
Don't
do
that.
A
pin's
brass.
It
might
have
verdigrease
on
it."
"What's
verdigrease?"
"It's
p'ison.
That's
what
it
is.
You
just
swaller
some
of
it
once
--you'll
see."
So
Tom
unwound
the
thread
from
one
of
his
needles,
and
each
boy
pricked
the
ball
of
his
thumb
and
squeezed
out
a
drop
of
blood.
In
time,
after
many
squeezes,
Tom
managed
to
sign
his
initials,
using
the
ball
of
his
little
finger
for
a
pen.
Then
he
showed
Huckleberry
how
to
make
an
H
and
an
F,
and
the
oath
was
complete.
They
buried
the
shingle
close
to
the
wall,
with
some
dismal
ceremonies
and
incantations,
and
the
fetters
that
bound
their
tongues
were
considered
to
be
locked
and
the
key
thrown
away.
A
figure
crept
stealthily
through
a
break
in
the
other
end
of
the
ruined
building,
now,
but
they
did
not
notice
it.
"Tom,"
whispered
Huckleberry,
"does
this
keep
us
from
EVER
telling
--ALWAYS?"
"Of
course
it
does.
It
don't
make
any
difference
WHAT
happens,
we
got
to
keep
mum.
We'd
drop
down
dead--don't
YOU
know
that?"
"Yes,
I
reckon
that's
so."
They
continued
to
whisper
for
some
little
time.
Presently
a
dog
set
up
a
long,
lugubrious
howl
just
outside--within
ten
feet
of
them.
The
boys
clasped
each
other
suddenly,
in
an
agony
of
fright.
"Which
of
us
does
he
mean?"
gasped
Huckleberry.
"I
dono--peep
through
the
crack.
Quick!"
"No,
YOU,
Tom!"
"I
can't--I
can't
DO
it,
Huck!"
"Please,
Tom.
There
'tis
again!"
"Oh,
lordy,
I'm
thankful!"
whispered
Tom.
"I
know
his
voice.
It's
Bull
Harbison."
*
[*
If
Mr.
Harbison
owned
a
slave
named
Bull,
Tom
would
have
spoken
of
him
as
"Harbison's
Bull,"
but
a
son
or
a
dog
of
that
name
was
"Bull
Harbison."]
"Oh,
that's
good--I
tell
you,
Tom,
I
was
most
scared
to
death;
I'd
a
bet
anything
it
was
a
STRAY
dog."
The
dog
howled
again.
The
boys'
hearts
sank
once
more.
"Oh,
my!
that
ain't
no
Bull
Harbison!"
whispered
Huckleberry.
"DO,
Tom!"
Tom,
quaking
with
fear,
yielded,
and
put
his
eye
to
the
crack.
His
whisper
was
hardly
audible
when
he
said:
"Oh,
Huck,
IT
S
A
STRAY
DOG!"
"Quick,
Tom,
quick!
Who
does
he
mean?"
"Huck,
he
must
mean
us
both--we're
right
together."
"Oh,
Tom,
I
reckon
we're
goners.
I
reckon
there
ain't
no
mistake
'bout
where
I'LL
go
to.
I
been
so
wicked."
"Dad
fetch
it!
This
comes
of
playing
hookey
and
doing
everything
a
feller's
told
NOT
to
do.
I
might
a
been
good,
like
Sid,
if
I'd
a
tried
--but
no,
I
wouldn't,
of
course.
But
if
ever
I
get
off
this
time,
I
lay
I'll
just
WALLER
in
Sunday-schools!"
And
Tom
began
to
snuffle
a
little.
"YOU
bad!"
and
Huckleberry
began
to
snuffle
too.
"Consound
it,
Tom
Sawyer,
you're
just
old
pie,
'longside
o'
what
I
am.
Oh,
LORDY,
lordy,
lordy,
I
wisht
I
only
had
half
your
chance."
Tom
choked
off
and
whispered:
"Look,
Hucky,
look!
He's
got
his
BACK
to
us!"
Hucky
looked,
with
joy
in
his
heart.
"Well,
he
has,
by
jingoes!
Did
he
before?"
"Yes,
he
did.
But
I,
like
a
fool,
never
thought.
Oh,
this
is
bully,
you
know.
NOW
who
can
he
mean?"
The
howling
stopped.
Tom
pricked
up
his
ears.
"Sh!
What's
that?"
he
whispered.
"Sounds
like--like
hogs
grunting.
No--it's
somebody
snoring,
Tom."
"That
IS
it!
Where
'bouts
is
it,
Huck?"
"I
bleeve
it's
down
at
'tother
end.
Sounds
so,
anyway.
Pap
used
to
sleep
there,
sometimes,
'long
with
the
hogs,
but
laws
bless
you,
he
just
lifts
things
when
HE
snores.
Besides,
I
reckon
he
ain't
ever
coming
back
to
this
town
any
more."
The
spirit
of
adventure
rose
in
the
boys'
souls
once
more.
"Hucky,
do
you
das't
to
go
if
I
lead?"
"I
don't
like
to,
much.
Tom,
s'pose
it's
Injun
Joe!"
Tom
quailed.
But
presently
the
temptation
rose
up
strong
again
and
the
boys
agreed
to
try,
with
the
understanding
that
they
would
take
to
their
heels
if
the
snoring
stopped.
So
they
went
tiptoeing
stealthily
down,
the
one
behind
the
other.
When
they
had
got
to
within
five
steps
of
the
snorer,
Tom
stepped
on
a
stick,
and
it
broke
with
a
sharp
snap.
The
man
moaned,
writhed
a
little,
and
his
face
came
into
the
moonlight.
It
was
Muff
Potter.
The
boys'
hearts
had
stood
still,
and
their
hopes
too,
when
the
man
moved,
but
their
fears
passed
away
now.
They
tiptoed
out,
through
the
broken
weather-boarding,
and
stopped
at
a
little
distance
to
exchange
a
parting
word.
That
long,
lugubrious
howl
rose
on
the
night
air
again!
They
turned
and
saw
the
strange
dog
standing
within
a
few
feet
of
where
Potter
was
lying,
and
FACING
Potter,
with
his
nose
pointing
heavenward.
"Oh,
geeminy,
it's
HIM!"
exclaimed
both
boys,
in
a
breath.
"Say,
Tom--they
say
a
stray
dog
come
howling
around
Johnny
Miller's
house,
'bout
midnight,
as
much
as
two
weeks
ago;
and
a
whippoorwill
come
in
and
lit
on
the
banisters
and
sung,
the
very
same
evening;
and
there
ain't
anybody
dead
there
yet."
"Well,
I
know
that.
And
suppose
there
ain't.
Didn't
Gracie
Miller
fall
in
the
kitchen
fire
and
burn
herself
terrible
the
very
next
Saturday?"
"Yes,
but
she
ain't
DEAD.
And
what's
more,
she's
getting
better,
too."
"All
right,
you
wait
and
see.
She's
a
goner,
just
as
dead
sure
as
Muff
Potter's
a
goner.
That's
what
the
niggers
say,
and
they
know
all
about
these
kind
of
things,
Huck."
Then
they
separated,
cogitating.
When
Tom
crept
in
at
his
bedroom
window
the
night
was
almost
spent.
He
undressed
with
excessive
caution,
and
fell
asleep
congratulating
himself
that
nobody
knew
of
his
escapade.
He
was
not
aware
that
the
gently-snoring
Sid
was
awake,
and
had
been
so
for
an
hour.
When
Tom
awoke,
Sid
was
dressed
and
gone.
There
was
a
late
look
in
the
light,
a
late
sense
in
the
atmosphere.
He
was
startled.
Why
had
he
not
been
called--persecuted
till
he
was
up,
as
usual?
The
thought
filled
him
with
bodings.
Within
five
minutes
he
was
dressed
and
down-stairs,
feeling
sore
and
drowsy.
The
family
were
still
at
table,
but
they
had
finished
breakfast.
There
was
no
voice
of
rebuke;
but
there
were
averted
eyes;
there
was
a
silence
and
an
air
of
solemnity
that
struck
a
chill
to
the
culprit's
heart.
He
sat
down
and
tried
to
seem
gay,
but
it
was
up-hill
work;
it
roused
no
smile,
no
response,
and
he
lapsed
into
silence
and
let
his
heart
sink
down
to
the
depths.
After
breakfast
his
aunt
took
him
aside,
and
Tom
almost
brightened
in
the
hope
that
he
was
going
to
be
flogged;
but
it
was
not
so.
His
aunt
wept
over
him
and
asked
him
how
he
could
go
and
break
her
old
heart
so;
and
finally
told
him
to
go
on,
and
ruin
himself
and
bring
her
gray
hairs
with
sorrow
to
the
grave,
for
it
was
no
use
for
her
to
try
any
more.
This
was
worse
than
a
thousand
whippings,
and
Tom's
heart
was
sorer
now
than
his
body.
He
cried,
he
pleaded
for
forgiveness,
promised
to
reform
over
and
over
again,
and
then
received
his
dismissal,
feeling
that
he
had
won
but
an
imperfect
forgiveness
and
established
but
a
feeble
confidence.
He
left
the
presence
too
miserable
to
even
feel
revengeful
toward
Sid;
and
so
the
latter's
prompt
retreat
through
the
back
gate
was
unnecessary.
He
moped
to
school
gloomy
and
sad,
and
took
his
flogging,
along
with
Joe
Harper,
for
playing
hookey
the
day
before,
with
the
air
of
one
whose
heart
was
busy
with
heavier
woes
and
wholly
dead
to
trifles.
Then
he
betook
himself
to
his
seat,
rested
his
elbows
on
his
desk
and
his
jaws
in
his
hands,
and
stared
at
the
wall
with
the
stony
stare
of
suffering
that
has
reached
the
limit
and
can
no
further
go.
His
elbow
was
pressing
against
some
hard
substance.
After
a
long
time
he
slowly
and
sadly
changed
his
position,
and
took
up
this
object
with
a
sigh.
It
was
in
a
paper.
He
unrolled
it.
A
long,
lingering,
colossal
sigh
followed,
and
his
heart
broke.
It
was
his
brass
andiron
knob!
This
final
feather
broke
the
camel's
back.
CHAPTER
XI
CLOSE
upon
the
hour
of
noon
the
whole
village
was
suddenly
electrified
with
the
ghastly
news.
No
need
of
the
as
yet
undreamed-of
telegraph;
the
tale
flew
from
man
to
man,
from
group
to
group,
from
house
to
house,
with
little
less
than
telegraphic
speed.
Of
course
the
schoolmaster
gave
holiday
for
that
afternoon;
the
town
would
have
thought
strangely
of
him
if
he
had
not.
A
gory
knife
had
been
found
close
to
the
murdered
man,
and
it
had
been
recognized
by
somebody
as
belonging
to
Muff
Potter--so
the
story
ran.
And
it
was
said
that
a
belated
citizen
had
come
upon
Potter
washing
himself
in
the
"branch"
about
one
or
two
o'clock
in
the
morning,
and
that
Potter
had
at
once
sneaked
off--suspicious
circumstances,
especially
the
washing
which
was
not
a
habit
with
Potter.
It
was
also
said
that
the
town
had
been
ransacked
for
this
"murderer"
(the
public
are
not
slow
in
the
matter
of
sifting
evidence
and
arriving
at
a
verdict),
but
that
he
could
not
be
found.
Horsemen
had
departed
down
all
the
roads
in
every
direction,
and
the
Sheriff
"was
confident"
that
he
would
be
captured
before
night.
All
the
town
was
drifting
toward
the
graveyard.
Tom's
heartbreak
vanished
and
he
joined
the
procession,
not
because
he
would
not
a
thousand
times
rather
go
anywhere
else,
but
because
an
awful,
unaccountable
fascination
drew
him
on.
Arrived
at
the
dreadful
place,
he
wormed
his
small
body
through
the
crowd
and
saw
the
dismal
spectacle.
It
seemed
to
him
an
age
since
he
was
there
before.
Somebody
pinched
his
arm.
He
turned,
and
his
eyes
met
Huckleberry's.
Then
both
looked
elsewhere
at
once,
and
wondered
if
anybody
had
noticed
anything
in
their
mutual
glance.
But
everybody
was
talking,
and
intent
upon
the
grisly
spectacle
before
them.
"Poor
fellow!"
"Poor
young
fellow!"
"This
ought
to
be
a
lesson
to
grave
robbers!"
"Muff
Potter'll
hang
for
this
if
they
catch
him!"
This
was
the
drift
of
remark;
and
the
minister
said,
"It
was
a
judgment;
His
hand
is
here."
Now
Tom
shivered
from
head
to
heel;
for
his
eye
fell
upon
the
stolid
face
of
Injun
Joe.
At
this
moment
the
crowd
began
to
sway
and
struggle,
and
voices
shouted,
"It's
him!
it's
him!
he's
coming
himself!"
"Who?
Who?"
from
twenty
voices.
"Muff
Potter!"
"Hallo,
he's
stopped!--Look
out,
he's
turning!
Don't
let
him
get
away!"
People
in
the
branches
of
the
trees
over
Tom's
head
said
he
wasn't
trying
to
get
away--he
only
looked
doubtful
and
perplexed.
"Infernal
impudence!"
said
a
bystander;
"wanted
to
come
and
take
a
quiet
look
at
his
work,
I
reckon--didn't
expect
any
company."
The
crowd
fell
apart,
now,
and
the
Sheriff
came
through,
ostentatiously
leading
Potter
by
the
arm.
The
poor
fellow's
face
was
haggard,
and
his
eyes
showed
the
fear
that
was
upon
him.
When
he
stood
before
the
murdered
man,
he
shook
as
with
a
palsy,
and
he
put
his
face
in
his
hands
and
burst
into
tears.
"I
didn't
do
it,
friends,"
he
sobbed;
"'pon
my
word
and
honor
I
never
done
it."
"Who's
accused
you?"
shouted
a
voice.
This
shot
seemed
to
carry
home.
Potter
lifted
his
face
and
looked
around
him
with
a
pathetic
hopelessness
in
his
eyes.
He
saw
Injun
Joe,
and
exclaimed:
"Oh,
Injun
Joe,
you
promised
me
you'd
never--"
"Is
that
your
knife?"
and
it
was
thrust
before
him
by
the
Sheriff.
Potter
would
have
fallen
if
they
had
not
caught
him
and
eased
him
to
the
ground.
Then
he
said:
"Something
told
me
't
if
I
didn't
come
back
and
get--"
He
shuddered;
then
waved
his
nerveless
hand
with
a
vanquished
gesture
and
said,
"Tell
'em,
Joe,
tell
'em--it
ain't
any
use
any
more."
Then
Huckleberry
and
Tom
stood
dumb
and
staring,
and
heard
the
stony-hearted
liar
reel
off
his
serene
statement,
they
expecting
every
moment
that
the
clear
sky
would
deliver
God's
lightnings
upon
his
head,
and
wondering
to
see
how
long
the
stroke
was
delayed.
And
when
he
had
finished
and
still
stood
alive
and
whole,
their
wavering
impulse
to
break
their
oath
and
save
the
poor
betrayed
prisoner's
life
faded
and
vanished
away,
for
plainly
this
miscreant
had
sold
himself
to
Satan
and
it
would
be
fatal
to
meddle
with
the
property
of
such
a
power
as
that.
"Why
didn't
you
leave?
What
did
you
want
to
come
here
for?"
somebody
said.
"I
couldn't
help
it--I
couldn't
help
it,"
Potter
moaned.
"I
wanted
to
run
away,
but
I
couldn't
seem
to
come
anywhere
but
here."
And
he
fell
to
sobbing
again.
Injun
Joe
repeated
his
statement,
just
as
calmly,
a
few
minutes
afterward
on
the
inquest,
under
oath;
and
the
boys,
seeing
that
the
lightnings
were
still
withheld,
were
confirmed
in
their
belief
that
Joe
had
sold
himself
to
the
devil.
He
was
now
become,
to
them,
the
most
balefully
interesting
object
they
had
ever
looked
upon,
and
they
could
not
take
their
fascinated
eyes
from
his
face.
They
inwardly
resolved
to
watch
him
nights,
when
opportunity
should
offer,
in
the
hope
of
getting
a
glimpse
of
his
dread
master.
Injun
Joe
helped
to
raise
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
and
put
it
in
a
wagon
for
removal;
and
it
was
whispered
through
the
shuddering
crowd
that
the
wound
bled
a
little!
The
boys
thought
that
this
happy
circumstance
would
turn
suspicion
in
the
right
direction;
but
they
were
disappointed,
for
more
than
one
villager
remarked:
"It
was
within
three
feet
of
Muff
Potter
when
it
done
it."
Tom's
fearful
secret
and
gnawing
conscience
disturbed
his
sleep
for
as
much
as
a
week
after
this;
and
at
breakfast
one
morning
Sid
said:
"Tom,
you
pitch
around
and
talk
in
your
sleep
so
much
that
you
keep
me
awake
half
the
time."
Tom
blanched
and
dropped
his
eyes.
"It's
a
bad
sign,"
said
Aunt
Polly,
gravely.
"What
you
got
on
your
mind,
Tom?"
"Nothing.
Nothing
't
I
know
of."
But
the
boy's
hand
shook
so
that
he
spilled
his
coffee.
"And
you
do
talk
such
stuff,"
Sid
said.
"Last
night
you
said,
'It's
blood,
it's
blood,
that's
what
it
is!'
You
said
that
over
and
over.
And
you
said,
'Don't
torment
me
so--I'll
tell!'
Tell
WHAT?
What
is
it
you'll
tell?"
Everything
was
swimming
before
Tom.
There
is
no
telling
what
might
have
happened,
now,
but
luckily
the
concern
passed
out
of
Aunt
Polly's
face
and
she
came
to
Tom's
relief
without
knowing
it.
She
said:
"Sho!
It's
that
dreadful
murder.
I
dream
about
it
most
every
night
myself.
Sometimes
I
dream
it's
me
that
done
it."
Mary
said
she
had
been
affected
much
the
same
way.
Sid
seemed
satisfied.
Tom
got
out
of
the
presence
as
quick
as
he
plausibly
could,
and
after
that
he
complained
of
toothache
for
a
week,
and
tied
up
his
jaws
every
night.
He
never
knew
that
Sid
lay
nightly
watching,
and
frequently
slipped
the
bandage
free
and
then
leaned
on
his
elbow
listening
a
good
while
at
a
time,
and
afterward
slipped
the
bandage
back
to
its
place
again.
Tom's
distress
of
mind
wore
off
gradually
and
the
toothache
grew
irksome
and
was
discarded.
If
Sid
really
managed
to
make
anything
out
of
Tom's
disjointed
mutterings,
he
kept
it
to
himself.
It
seemed
to
Tom
that
his
schoolmates
never
would
get
done
holding
inquests
on
dead
cats,
and
thus
keeping
his
trouble
present
to
his
mind.
Sid
noticed
that
Tom
never
was
coroner
at
one
of
these
inquiries,
though
it
had
been
his
habit
to
take
the
lead
in
all
new
enterprises;
he
noticed,
too,
that
Tom
never
acted
as
a
witness--and
that
was
strange;
and
Sid
did
not
overlook
the
fact
that
Tom
even
showed
a
marked
aversion
to
these
inquests,
and
always
avoided
them
when
he
could.
Sid
marvelled,
but
said
nothing.
However,
even
inquests
went
out
of
vogue
at
last,
and
ceased
to
torture
Tom's
conscience.
Every
day
or
two,
during
this
time
of
sorrow,
Tom
watched
his
opportunity
and
went
to
the
little
grated
jail-window
and
smuggled
such
small
comforts
through
to
the
"murderer"
as
he
could
get
hold
of.
The
jail
was
a
trifling
little
brick
den
that
stood
in
a
marsh
at
the
edge
of
the
village,
and
no
guards
were
afforded
for
it;
indeed,
it
was
seldom
occupied.
These
offerings
greatly
helped
to
ease
Tom's
conscience.
The
villagers
had
a
strong
desire
to
tar-and-feather
Injun
Joe
and
ride
him
on
a
rail,
for
body-snatching,
but
so
formidable
was
his
character
that
nobody
could
be
found
who
was
willing
to
take
the
lead
in
the
matter,
so
it
was
dropped.
He
had
been
careful
to
begin
both
of
his
inquest-statements
with
the
fight,
without
confessing
the
grave-robbery
that
preceded
it;
therefore
it
was
deemed
wisest
not
to
try
the
case
in
the
courts
at
present.
CHAPTER
XII
ONE
of
the
reasons
why
Tom's
mind
had
drifted
away
from
its
secret
troubles
was,
that
it
had
found
a
new
and
weighty
matter
to
interest
itself
about.
Becky
Thatcher
had
stopped
coming
to
school.
Tom
had
struggled
with
his
pride
a
few
days,
and
tried
to
"whistle
her
down
the
wind,"
but
failed.
He
began
to
find
himself
hanging
around
her
father's
house,
nights,
and
feeling
very
miserable.
She
was
ill.
What
if
she
should
die!
There
was
distraction
in
the
thought.
He
no
longer
took
an
interest
in
war,
nor
even
in
piracy.
The
charm
of
life
was
gone;
there
was
nothing
but
dreariness
left.
He
put
his
hoop
away,
and
his
bat;
there
was
no
joy
in
them
any
more.
His
aunt
was
concerned.
She
began
to
try
all
manner
of
remedies
on
him.
She
was
one
of
those
people
who
are
infatuated
with
patent
medicines
and
all
new-fangled
methods
of
producing
health
or
mending
it.
She
was
an
inveterate
experimenter
in
these
things.
When
something
fresh
in
this
line
came
out
she
was
in
a
fever,
right
away,
to
try
it;
not
on
herself,
for
she
was
never
ailing,
but
on
anybody
else
that
came
handy.
She
was
a
subscriber
for
all
the
"Health"
periodicals
and
phrenological
frauds;
and
the
solemn
ignorance
they
were
inflated
with
was
breath
to
her
nostrils.
All
the
"rot"
they
contained
about
ventilation,
and
how
to
go
to
bed,
and
how
to
get
up,
and
what
to
eat,
and
what
to
drink,
and
how
much
exercise
to
take,
and
what
frame
of
mind
to
keep
one's
self
in,
and
what
sort
of
clothing
to
wear,
was
all
gospel
to
her,
and
she
never
observed
that
her
health-journals
of
the
current
month
customarily
upset
everything
they
had
recommended
the
month
before.
She
was
as
simple-hearted
and
honest
as
the
day
was
long,
and
so
she
was
an
easy
victim.
She
gathered
together
her
quack
periodicals
and
her
quack
medicines,
and
thus
armed
with
death,
went
about
on
her
pale
horse,
metaphorically
speaking,
with
"hell
following
after."
But
she
never
suspected
that
she
was
not
an
angel
of
healing
and
the
balm
of
Gilead
in
disguise,
to
the
suffering
neighbors.
The
water
treatment
was
new,
now,
and
Tom's
low
condition
was
a
windfall
to
her.
She
had
him
out
at
daylight
every
morning,
stood
him
up
in
the
woodshed
and
drowned
him
with
a
deluge
of
cold
water;
then
she
scrubbed
him
down
with
a
towel
like
a
file,
and
so
brought
him
to;
then
she
rolled
him
up
in
a
wet
sheet
and
put
him
away
under
blankets
till
she
sweated
his
soul
clean
and
"the
yellow
stains
of
it
came
through
his
pores"--as
Tom
said.
Yet
notwithstanding
all
this,
the
boy
grew
more
and
more
melancholy
and
pale
and
dejected.
She
added
hot
baths,
sitz
baths,
shower
baths,
and
plunges.
The
boy
remained
as
dismal
as
a
hearse.
She
began
to
assist
the
water
with
a
slim
oatmeal
diet
and
blister-plasters.
She
calculated
his
capacity
as
she
would
a
jug's,
and
filled
him
up
every
day
with
quack
cure-alls.
Tom
had
become
indifferent
to
persecution
by
this
time.
This
phase
filled
the
old
lady's
heart
with
consternation.
This
indifference
must
be
broken
up
at
any
cost.
Now
she
heard
of
Pain-killer
for
the
first
time.
She
ordered
a
lot
at
once.
She
tasted
it
and
was
filled
with
gratitude.
It
was
simply
fire
in
a
liquid
form.
She
dropped
the
water
treatment
and
everything
else,
and
pinned
her
faith
to
Pain-killer.
She
gave
Tom
a
teaspoonful
and
watched
with
the
deepest
anxiety
for
the
result.
Her
troubles
were
instantly
at
rest,
her
soul
at
peace
again;
for
the
"indifference"
was
broken
up.
The
boy
could
not
have
shown
a
wilder,
heartier
interest,
if
she
had
built
a
fire
under
him.
Tom
felt
that
it
was
time
to
wake
up;
this
sort
of
life
might
be
romantic
enough,
in
his
blighted
condition,
but
it
was
getting
to
have
too
little
sentiment
and
too
much
distracting
variety
about
it.
So
he
thought
over
various
plans
for
relief,
and
finally
hit
pon
that
of
professing
to
be
fond
of
Pain-killer.
He
asked
for
it
so
often
that
he
became
a
nuisance,
and
his
aunt
ended
by
telling
him
to
help
himself
and
quit
bothering
her.
If
it
had
been
Sid,
she
would
have
had
no
misgivings
to
alloy
her
delight;
but
since
it
was
Tom,
she
watched
the
bottle
clandestinely.
She
found
that
the
medicine
did
really
diminish,
but
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
the
boy
was
mending
the
health
of
a
crack
in
the
sitting-room
floor
with
it.
One
day
Tom
was
in
the
act
of
dosing
the
crack
when
his
aunt's
yellow
cat
came
along,
purring,
eying
the
teaspoon
avariciously,
and
begging
for
a
taste.
Tom
said:
"Don't
ask
for
it
unless
you
want
it,
Peter."
But
Peter
signified
that
he
did
want
it.
"You
better
make
sure."
Peter
was
sure.
"Now
you've
asked
for
it,
and
I'll
give
it
to
you,
because
there
ain't
anything
mean
about
me;
but
if
you
find
you
don't
like
it,
you
mustn't
blame
anybody
but
your
own
self."
Peter
was
agreeable.
So
Tom
pried
his
mouth
open
and
poured
down
the
Pain-killer.
Peter
sprang
a
couple
of
yards
in
the
air,
and
then
delivered
a
war-whoop
and
set
off
round
and
round
the
room,
banging
against
furniture,
upsetting
flower-pots,
and
making
general
havoc.
Next
he
rose
on
his
hind
feet
and
pranced
around,
in
a
frenzy
of
enjoyment,
with
his
head
over
his
shoulder
and
his
voice
proclaiming
his
unappeasable
happiness.
Then
he
went
tearing
around
the
house
again
spreading
chaos
and
destruction
in
his
path.
Aunt
Polly
entered
in
time
to
see
him
throw
a
few
double
summersets,
deliver
a
final
mighty
hurrah,
and
sail
through
the
open
window,
carrying
the
rest
of
the
flower-pots
with
him.
The
old
lady
stood
petrified
with
astonishment,
peering
over
her
glasses;
Tom
lay
on
the
floor
expiring
with
laughter.
"Tom,
what
on
earth
ails
that
cat?"
"I
don't
know,
aunt,"
gasped
the
boy.
"Why,
I
never
see
anything
like
it.
What
did
make
him
act
so?"
"Deed
I
don't
know,
Aunt
Polly;
cats
always
act
so
when
they're
having
a
good
time."
"They
do,
do
they?"
There
was
something
in
the
tone
that
made
Tom
apprehensive.
"Yes'm.
That
is,
I
believe
they
do."
"You
DO?"
"Yes'm."
The
old
lady
was
bending
down,
Tom
watching,
with
interest
emphasized
by
anxiety.
Too
late
he
divined
her
"drift."
The
handle
of
the
telltale
teaspoon
was
visible
under
the
bed-valance.
Aunt
Polly
took
it,
held
it
up.
Tom
winced,
and
dropped
his
eyes.
Aunt
Polly
raised
him
by
the
usual
handle--his
ear--and
cracked
his
head
soundly
with
her
thimble.
"Now,
sir,
what
did
you
want
to
treat
that
poor
dumb
beast
so,
for?"
"I
done
it
out
of
pity
for
him--because
he
hadn't
any
aunt."
"Hadn't
any
aunt!--you
numskull.
What
has
that
got
to
do
with
it?"
"Heaps.
Because
if
he'd
had
one
she'd
a
burnt
him
out
herself!
She'd
a
roasted
his
bowels
out
of
him
'thout
any
more
feeling
than
if
he
was
a
human!"
Aunt
Polly
felt
a
sudden
pang
of
remorse.
This
was
putting
the
thing
in
a
new
light;
what
was
cruelty
to
a
cat
MIGHT
be
cruelty
to
a
boy,
too.
She
began
to
soften;
she
felt
sorry.
Her
eyes
watered
a
little,
and
she
put
her
hand
on
Tom's
head
and
said
gently:
"I
was
meaning
for
the
best,
Tom.
And,
Tom,
it
DID
do
you
good."
Tom
looked
up
in
her
face
with
just
a
perceptible
twinkle
peeping
through
his
gravity.
"I
know
you
was
meaning
for
the
best,
aunty,
and
so
was
I
with
Peter.
It
done
HIM
good,
too.
I
never
see
him
get
around
so
since--"
"Oh,
go
'long
with
you,
Tom,
before
you
aggravate
me
again.
And
you
try
and
see
if
you
can't
be
a
good
boy,
for
once,
and
you
needn't
take
any
more
medicine."
Tom
reached
school
ahead
of
time.
It
was
noticed
that
this
strange
thing
had
been
occurring
every
day
latterly.
And
now,
as
usual
of
late,
he
hung
about
the
gate
of
the
schoolyard
instead
of
playing
with
his
comrades.
He
was
sick,
he
said,
and
he
looked
it.
He
tried
to
seem
to
be
looking
everywhere
but
whither
he
really
was
looking--down
the
road.
Presently
Jeff
Thatcher
hove
in
sight,
and
Tom's
face
lighted;
he
gazed
a
moment,
and
then
turned
sorrowfully
away.
When
Jeff
arrived,
Tom
accosted
him;
and
"led
up"
warily
to
opportunities
for
remark
about
Becky,
but
the
giddy
lad
never
could
see
the
bait.
Tom
watched
and
watched,
hoping
whenever
a
frisking
frock
came
in
sight,
and
hating
the
owner
of
it
as
soon
as
he
saw
she
was
not
the
right
one.
At
last
frocks
ceased
to
appear,
and
he
dropped
hopelessly
into
the
dumps;
he
entered
the
empty
schoolhouse
and
sat
down
to
suffer.
Then
one
more
frock
passed
in
at
the
gate,
and
Tom's
heart
gave
a
great
bound.
The
next
instant
he
was
out,
and
"going
on"
like
an
Indian;
yelling,
laughing,
chasing
boys,
jumping
over
the
fence
at
risk
of
life
and
limb,
throwing
handsprings,
standing
on
his
head--doing
all
the
heroic
things
he
could
conceive
of,
and
keeping
a
furtive
eye
out,
all
the
while,
to
see
if
Becky
Thatcher
was
noticing.
But
she
seemed
to
be
unconscious
of
it
all;
she
never
looked.
Could
it
be
possible
that
she
was
not
aware
that
he
was
there?
He
carried
his
exploits
to
her
immediate
vicinity;
came
war-whooping
around,
snatched
a
boy's
cap,
hurled
it
to
the
roof
of
the
schoolhouse,
broke
through
a
group
of
boys,
tumbling
them
in
every
direction,
and
fell
sprawling,
himself,
under
Becky's
nose,
almost
upsetting
her--and
she
turned,
with
her
nose
in
the
air,
and
he
heard
her
say:
"Mf!
some
people
think
they're
mighty
smart--always
showing
off!"
Tom's
cheeks
burned.
He
gathered
himself
up
and
sneaked
off,
crushed
and
crestfallen.
CHAPTER
XIII
TOM'S
mind
was
made
up
now.
He
was
gloomy
and
desperate.
He
was
a
forsaken,
friendless
boy,
he
said;
nobody
loved
him;
when
they
found
out
what
they
had
driven
him
to,
perhaps
they
would
be
sorry;
he
had
tried
to
do
right
and
get
along,
but
they
would
not
let
him;
since
nothing
would
do
them
but
to
be
rid
of
him,
let
it
be
so;
and
let
them
blame
HIM
for
the
consequences--why
shouldn't
they?
What
right
had
the
friendless
to
complain?
Yes,
they
had
forced
him
to
it
at
last:
he
would
lead
a
life
of
crime.
There
was
no
choice.
By
this
time
he
was
far
down
Meadow
Lane,
and
the
bell
for
school
to
"take
up"
tinkled
faintly
upon
his
ear.
He
sobbed,
now,
to
think
he
should
never,
never
hear
that
old
familiar
sound
any
more--it
was
very
hard,
but
it
was
forced
on
him;
since
he
was
driven
out
into
the
cold
world,
he
must
submit--but
he
forgave
them.
Then
the
sobs
came
thick
and
fast.
Just
at
this
point
he
met
his
soul's
sworn
comrade,
Joe
Harper
--hard-eyed,
and
with
evidently
a
great
and
dismal
purpose
in
his
heart.
Plainly
here
were
"two
souls
with
but
a
single
thought."
Tom,
wiping
his
eyes
with
his
sleeve,
began
to
blubber
out
something
about
a
resolution
to
escape
from
hard
usage
and
lack
of
sympathy
at
home
by
roaming
abroad
into
the
great
world
never
to
return;
and
ended
by
hoping
that
Joe
would
not
forget
him.
But
it
transpired
that
this
was
a
request
which
Joe
had
just
been
going
to
make
of
Tom,
and
had
come
to
hunt
him
up
for
that
purpose.
His
mother
had
whipped
him
for
drinking
some
cream
which
he
had
never
tasted
and
knew
nothing
about;
it
was
plain
that
she
was
tired
of
him
and
wished
him
to
go;
if
she
felt
that
way,
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
succumb;
he
hoped
she
would
be
happy,
and
never
regret
having
driven
her
poor
boy
out
into
the
unfeeling
world
to
suffer
and
die.
As
the
two
boys
walked
sorrowing
along,
they
made
a
new
compact
to
stand
by
each
other
and
be
brothers
and
never
separate
till
death
relieved
them
of
their
troubles.
Then
they
began
to
lay
their
plans.
Joe
was
for
being
a
hermit,
and
living
on
crusts
in
a
remote
cave,
and
dying,
some
time,
of
cold
and
want
and
grief;
but
after
listening
to
Tom,
he
conceded
that
there
were
some
conspicuous
advantages
about
a
life
of
crime,
and
so
he
consented
to
be
a
pirate.
Three
miles
below
St.
Petersburg,
at
a
point
where
the
Mississippi
River
was
a
trifle
over
a
mile
wide,
there
was
a
long,
narrow,
wooded
island,
with
a
shallow
bar
at
the
head
of
it,
and
this
offered
well
as
a
rendezvous.
It
was
not
inhabited;
it
lay
far
over
toward
the
further
shore,
abreast
a
dense
and
almost
wholly
unpeopled
forest.
So
Jackson's
Island
was
chosen.
Who
were
to
be
the
subjects
of
their
piracies
was
a
matter
that
did
not
occur
to
them.
Then
they
hunted
up
Huckleberry
Finn,
and
he
joined
them
promptly,
for
all
careers
were
one
to
him;
he
was
indifferent.
They
presently
separated
to
meet
at
a
lonely
spot
on
the
river-bank
two
miles
above
the
village
at
the
favorite
hour--which
was
midnight.
There
was
a
small
log
raft
there
which
they
meant
to
capture.
Each
would
bring
hooks
and
lines,
and
such
provision
as
he
could
steal
in
the
most
dark
and
mysterious
way--as
became
outlaws.
And
before
the
afternoon
was
done,
they
had
all
managed
to
enjoy
the
sweet
glory
of
spreading
the
fact
that
pretty
soon
the
town
would
"hear
something."
All
who
got
this
vague
hint
were
cautioned
to
"be
mum
and
wait."
About
midnight
Tom
arrived
with
a
boiled
ham
and
a
few
trifles,
and
stopped
in
a
dense
undergrowth
on
a
small
bluff
overlooking
the
meeting-place.
It
was
starlight,
and
very
still.
The
mighty
river
lay
like
an
ocean
at
rest.
Tom
listened
a
moment,
but
no
sound
disturbed
the
quiet.
Then
he
gave
a
low,
distinct
whistle.
It
was
answered
from
under
the
bluff.
Tom
whistled
twice
more;
these
signals
were
answered
in
the
same
way.
Then
a
guarded
voice
said:
"Who
goes
there?"
"Tom
Sawyer,
the
Black
Avenger
of
the
Spanish
Main.
Name
your
names."
"Huck
Finn
the
Red-Handed,
and
Joe
Harper
the
Terror
of
the
Seas."
Tom
had
furnished
these
titles,
from
his
favorite
literature.
"'Tis
well.
Give
the
countersign."
Two
hoarse
whispers
delivered
the
same
awful
word
simultaneously
to
the
brooding
night:
"BLOOD!"
Then
Tom
tumbled
his
ham
over
the
bluff
and
let
himself
down
after
it,
tearing
both
skin
and
clothes
to
some
extent
in
the
effort.
There
was
an
easy,
comfortable
path
along
the
shore
under
the
bluff,
but
it
lacked
the
advantages
of
difficulty
and
danger
so
valued
by
a
pirate.
The
Terror
of
the
Seas
had
brought
a
side
of
bacon,
and
had
about
worn
himself
out
with
getting
it
there.
Finn
the
Red-Handed
had
stolen
a
skillet
and
a
quantity
of
half-cured
leaf
tobacco,
and
had
also
brought
a
few
corn-cobs
to
make
pipes
with.
But
none
of
the
pirates
smoked
or
"chewed"
but
himself.
The
Black
Avenger
of
the
Spanish
Main
said
it
would
never
do
to
start
without
some
fire.
That
was
a
wise
thought;
matches
were
hardly
known
there
in
that
day.
They
saw
a
fire
smouldering
upon
a
great
raft
a
hundred
yards
above,
and
they
went
stealthily
thither
and
helped
themselves
to
a
chunk.
They
made
an
imposing
adventure
of
it,
saying,
"Hist!"
every
now
and
then,
and
suddenly
halting
with
finger
on
lip;
moving
with
hands
on
imaginary
dagger-hilts;
and
giving
orders
in
dismal
whispers
that
if
"the
foe"
stirred,
to
"let
him
have
it
to
the
hilt,"
because
"dead
men
tell
no
tales."
They
knew
well
enough
that
the
raftsmen
were
all
down
at
the
village
laying
in
stores
or
having
a
spree,
but
still
that
was
no
excuse
for
their
conducting
this
thing
in
an
unpiratical
way.
They
shoved
off,
presently,
Tom
in
command,
Huck
at
the
after
oar
and
Joe
at
the
forward.
Tom
stood
amidships,
gloomy-browed,
and
with
folded
arms,
and
gave
his
orders
in
a
low,
stern
whisper:
"Luff,
and
bring
her
to
the
wind!"
"Aye-aye,
sir!"
"Steady,
steady-y-y-y!"
"Steady
it
is,
sir!"
"Let
her
go
off
a
point!"
"Point
it
is,
sir!"
As
the
boys
steadily
and
monotonously
drove
the
raft
toward
mid-stream
it
was
no
doubt
understood
that
these
orders
were
given
only
for
"style,"
and
were
not
intended
to
mean
anything
in
particular.
"What
sail's
she
carrying?"
"Courses,
tops'ls,
and
flying-jib,
sir."
"Send
the
r'yals
up!
Lay
out
aloft,
there,
half
a
dozen
of
ye
--foretopmaststuns'l!
Lively,
now!"
"Aye-aye,
sir!"
"Shake
out
that
maintogalans'l!
Sheets
and
braces!
NOW
my
hearties!"
"Aye-aye,
sir!"
"Hellum-a-lee--hard
a
port!
Stand
by
to
meet
her
when
she
comes!
Port,
port!
NOW,
men!
With
a
will!
Stead-y-y-y!"
"Steady
it
is,
sir!"
The
raft
drew
beyond
the
middle
of
the
river;
the
boys
pointed
her
head
right,
and
then
lay
on
their
oars.
The
river
was
not
high,
so
there
was
not
more
than
a
two
or
three
mile
current.
Hardly
a
word
was
said
during
the
next
three-quarters
of
an
hour.
Now
the
raft
was
passing
before
the
distant
town.
Two
or
three
glimmering
lights
showed
where
it
lay,
peacefully
sleeping,
beyond
the
vague
vast
sweep
of
star-gemmed
water,
unconscious
of
the
tremendous
event
that
was
happening.
The
Black
Avenger
stood
still
with
folded
arms,
"looking
his
last"
upon
the
scene
of
his
former
joys
and
his
later
sufferings,
and
wishing
"she"
could
see
him
now,
abroad
on
the
wild
sea,
facing
peril
and
death
with
dauntless
heart,
going
to
his
doom
with
a
grim
smile
on
his
lips.
It
was
but
a
small
strain
on
his
imagination
to
remove
Jackson's
Island
beyond
eyeshot
of
the
village,
and
so
he
"looked
his
last"
with
a
broken
and
satisfied
heart.
The
other
pirates
were
looking
their
last,
too;
and
they
all
looked
so
long
that
they
came
near
letting
the
current
drift
them
out
of
the
range
of
the
island.
But
they
discovered
the
danger
in
time,
and
made
shift
to
avert
it.
About
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
the
raft
grounded
on
the
bar
two
hundred
yards
above
the
head
of
the
island,
and
they
waded
back
and
forth
until
they
had
landed
their
freight.
Part
of
the
little
raft's
belongings
consisted
of
an
old
sail,
and
this
they
spread
over
a
nook
in
the
bushes
for
a
tent
to
shelter
their
provisions;
but
they
themselves
would
sleep
in
the
open
air
in
good
weather,
as
became
outlaws.
They
built
a
fire
against
the
side
of
a
great
log
twenty
or
thirty
steps
within
the
sombre
depths
of
the
forest,
and
then
cooked
some
bacon
in
the
frying-pan
for
supper,
and
used
up
half
of
the
corn
"pone"
stock
they
had
brought.
It
seemed
glorious
sport
to
be
feasting
in
that
wild,
free
way
in
the
virgin
forest
of
an
unexplored
and
uninhabited
island,
far
from
the
haunts
of
men,
and
they
said
they
never
would
return
to
civilization.
The
climbing
fire
lit
up
their
faces
and
threw
its
ruddy
glare
upon
the
pillared
tree-trunks
of
their
forest
temple,
and
upon
the
varnished
foliage
and
festooning
vines.
When
the
last
crisp
slice
of
bacon
was
gone,
and
the
last
allowance
of
corn
pone
devoured,
the
boys
stretched
themselves
out
on
the
grass,
filled
with
contentment.
They
could
have
found
a
cooler
place,
but
they
would
not
deny
themselves
such
a
romantic
feature
as
the
roasting
camp-fire.
"AIN'T
it
gay?"
said
Joe.
"It's
NUTS!"
said
Tom.
"What
would
the
boys
say
if
they
could
see
us?"
"Say?
Well,
they'd
just
die
to
be
here--hey,
Hucky!"
"I
reckon
so,"
said
Huckleberry;
"anyways,
I'm
suited.
I
don't
want
nothing
better'n
this.
I
don't
ever
get
enough
to
eat,
gen'ally--and
here
they
can't
come
and
pick
at
a
feller
and
bullyrag
him
so."
"It's
just
the
life
for
me,"
said
Tom.
"You
don't
have
to
get
up,
mornings,
and
you
don't
have
to
go
to
school,
and
wash,
and
all
that
blame
foolishness.
You
see
a
pirate
don't
have
to
do
ANYTHING,
Joe,
when
he's
ashore,
but
a
hermit
HE
has
to
be
praying
considerable,
and
then
he
don't
have
any
fun,
anyway,
all
by
himself
that
way."
"Oh
yes,
that's
so,"
said
Joe,
"but
I
hadn't
thought
much
about
it,
you
know.
I'd
a
good
deal
rather
be
a
pirate,
now
that
I've
tried
it."
"You
see,"
said
Tom,
"people
don't
go
much
on
hermits,
nowadays,
like
they
used
to
in
old
times,
but
a
pirate's
always
respected.
And
a
hermit's
got
to
sleep
on
the
hardest
place
he
can
find,
and
put
sackcloth
and
ashes
on
his
head,
and
stand
out
in
the
rain,
and--"
"What
does
he
put
sackcloth
and
ashes
on
his
head
for?"
inquired
Huck.
"I
dono.
But
they've
GOT
to
do
it.
Hermits
always
do.
You'd
have
to
do
that
if
you
was
a
hermit."
"Dern'd
if
I
would,"
said
Huck.
"Well,
what
would
you
do?"
"I
dono.
But
I
wouldn't
do
that."
"Why,
Huck,
you'd
HAVE
to.
How'd
you
get
around
it?"
"Why,
I
just
wouldn't
stand
it.
I'd
run
away."
"Run
away!
Well,
you
WOULD
be
a
nice
old
slouch
of
a
hermit.
You'd
be
a
disgrace."
The
Red-Handed
made
no
response,
being
better
employed.
He
had
finished
gouging
out
a
cob,
and
now
he
fitted
a
weed
stem
to
it,
loaded
it
with
tobacco,
and
was
pressing
a
coal
to
the
charge
and
blowing
a
cloud
of
fragrant
smoke--he
was
in
the
full
bloom
of
luxurious
contentment.
The
other
pirates
envied
him
this
majestic
vice,
and
secretly
resolved
to
acquire
it
shortly.
Presently
Huck
said:
"What
does
pirates
have
to
do?"
Tom
said:
"Oh,
they
have
just
a
bully
time--take
ships
and
burn
them,
and
get
the
money
and
bury
it
in
awful
places
in
their
island
where
there's
ghosts
and
things
to
watch
it,
and
kill
everybody
in
the
ships--make
'em
walk
a
plank."
"And
they
carry
the
women
to
the
island,"
said
Joe;
"they
don't
kill
the
women."
"No,"
assented
Tom,
"they
don't
kill
the
women--they're
too
noble.
And
the
women's
always
beautiful,
too.
"And
don't
they
wear
the
bulliest
clothes!
Oh
no!
All
gold
and
silver
and
di'monds,"
said
Joe,
with
enthusiasm.
"Who?"
said
Huck.
"Why,
the
pirates."
Huck
scanned
his
own
clothing
forlornly.
"I
reckon
I
ain't
dressed
fitten
for
a
pirate,"
said
he,
with
a
regretful
pathos
in
his
voice;
"but
I
ain't
got
none
but
these."
But
the
other
boys
told
him
the
fine
clothes
would
come
fast
enough,
after
they
should
have
begun
their
adventures.
They
made
him
understand
that
his
poor
rags
would
do
to
begin
with,
though
it
was
customary
for
wealthy
pirates
to
start
with
a
proper
wardrobe.
Gradually
their
talk
died
out
and
drowsiness
began
to
steal
upon
the
eyelids
of
the
little
waifs.
The
pipe
dropped
from
the
fingers
of
the
Red-Handed,
and
he
slept
the
sleep
of
the
conscience-free
and
the
weary.
The
Terror
of
the
Seas
and
the
Black
Avenger
of
the
Spanish
Main
had
more
difficulty
in
getting
to
sleep.
They
said
their
prayers
inwardly,
and
lying
down,
since
there
was
nobody
there
with
authority
to
make
them
kneel
and
recite
aloud;
in
truth,
they
had
a
mind
not
to
say
them
at
all,
but
they
were
afraid
to
proceed
to
such
lengths
as
that,
lest
they
might
call
down
a
sudden
and
special
thunderbolt
from
heaven.
Then
at
once
they
reached
and
hovered
upon
the
imminent
verge
of
sleep--but
an
intruder
came,
now,
that
would
not
"down."
It
was
conscience.
They
began
to
feel
a
vague
fear
that
they
had
been
doing
wrong
to
run
away;
and
next
they
thought
of
the
stolen
meat,
and
then
the
real
torture
came.
They
tried
to
argue
it
away
by
reminding
conscience
that
they
had
purloined
sweetmeats
and
apples
scores
of
times;
but
conscience
was
not
to
be
appeased
by
such
thin
plausibilities;
it
seemed
to
them,
in
the
end,
that
there
was
no
getting
around
the
stubborn
fact
that
taking
sweetmeats
was
only
"hooking,"
while
taking
bacon
and
hams
and
such
valuables
was
plain
simple
stealing--and
there
was
a
command
against
that
in
the
Bible.
So
they
inwardly
resolved
that
so
long
as
they
remained
in
the
business,
their
piracies
should
not
again
be
sullied
with
the
crime
of
stealing.
Then
conscience
granted
a
truce,
and
these
curiously
inconsistent
pirates
fell
peacefully
to
sleep.
CHAPTER
XIV
WHEN
Tom
awoke
in
the
morning,
he
wondered
where
he
was.
He
sat
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looked
around.
Then
he
comprehended.
It
was
the
cool
gray
dawn,
and
there
was
a
delicious
sense
of
repose
and
peace
in
the
deep
pervading
calm
and
silence
of
the
woods.
Not
a
leaf
stirred;
not
a
sound
obtruded
upon
great
Nature's
meditation.
Beaded
dewdrops
stood
upon
the
leaves
and
grasses.
A
white
layer
of
ashes
covered
the
fire,
and
a
thin
blue
breath
of
smoke
rose
straight
into
the
air.
Joe
and
Huck
still
slept.
Now,
far
away
in
the
woods
a
bird
called;
another
answered;
presently
the
hammering
of
a
woodpecker
was
heard.
Gradually
the
cool
dim
gray
of
the
morning
whitened,
and
as
gradually
sounds
multiplied
and
life
manifested
itself.
The
marvel
of
Nature
shaking
off
sleep
and
going
to
work
unfolded
itself
to
the
musing
boy.
A
little
green
worm
came
crawling
over
a
dewy
leaf,
lifting
two-thirds
of
his
body
into
the
air
from
time
to
time
and
"sniffing
around,"
then
proceeding
again--for
he
was
measuring,
Tom
said;
and
when
the
worm
approached
him,
of
its
own
accord,
he
sat
as
still
as
a
stone,
with
his
hopes
rising
and
falling,
by
turns,
as
the
creature
still
came
toward
him
or
seemed
inclined
to
go
elsewhere;
and
when
at
last
it
considered
a
painful
moment
with
its
curved
body
in
the
air
and
then
came
decisively
down
upon
Tom's
leg
and
began
a
journey
over
him,
his
whole
heart
was
glad--for
that
meant
that
he
was
going
to
have
a
new
suit
of
clothes--without
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
a
gaudy
piratical
uniform.
Now
a
procession
of
ants
appeared,
from
nowhere
in
particular,
and
went
about
their
labors;
one
struggled
manfully
by
with
a
dead
spider
five
times
as
big
as
itself
in
its
arms,
and
lugged
it
straight
up
a
tree-trunk.
A
brown
spotted
lady-bug
climbed
the
dizzy
height
of
a
grass
blade,
and
Tom
bent
down
close
to
it
and
said,
"Lady-bug,
lady-bug,
fly
away
home,
your
house
is
on
fire,
your
children's
alone,"
and
she
took
wing
and
went
off
to
see
about
it
--which
did
not
surprise
the
boy,
for
he
knew
of
old
that
this
insect
was
credulous
about
conflagrations,
and
he
had
practised
upon
its
simplicity
more
than
once.
A
tumblebug
came
next,
heaving
sturdily
at
its
ball,
and
Tom
touched
the
creature,
to
see
it
shut
its
legs
against
its
body
and
pretend
to
be
dead.
The
birds
were
fairly
rioting
by
this
time.
A
catbird,
the
Northern
mocker,
lit
in
a
tree
over
Tom's
head,
and
trilled
out
her
imitations
of
her
neighbors
in
a
rapture
of
enjoyment;
then
a
shrill
jay
swept
down,
a
flash
of
blue
flame,
and
stopped
on
a
twig
almost
within
the
boy's
reach,
cocked
his
head
to
one
side
and
eyed
the
strangers
with
a
consuming
curiosity;
a
gray
squirrel
and
a
big
fellow
of
the
"fox"
kind
came
skurrying
along,
sitting
up
at
intervals
to
inspect
and
chatter
at
the
boys,
for
the
wild
things
had
probably
never
seen
a
human
being
before
and
scarcely
knew
whether
to
be
afraid
or
not.
All
Nature
was
wide
awake
and
stirring,
now;
long
lances
of
sunlight
pierced
down
through
the
dense
foliage
far
and
near,
and
a
few
butterflies
came
fluttering
upon
the
scene.
Tom
stirred
up
the
other
pirates
and
they
all
clattered
away
with
a
shout,
and
in
a
minute
or
two
were
stripped
and
chasing
after
and
tumbling
over
each
other
in
the
shallow
limpid
water
of
the
white
sandbar.
They
felt
no
longing
for
the
little
village
sleeping
in
the
distance
beyond
the
majestic
waste
of
water.
A
vagrant
current
or
a
slight
rise
in
the
river
had
carried
off
their
raft,
but
this
only
gratified
them,
since
its
going
was
something
like
burning
the
bridge
between
them
and
civilization.
They
came
back
to
camp
wonderfully
refreshed,
glad-hearted,
and
ravenous;
and
they
soon
had
the
camp-fire
blazing
up
again.
Huck
found
a
spring
of
clear
cold
water
close
by,
and
the
boys
made
cups
of
broad
oak
or
hickory
leaves,
and
felt
that
water,
sweetened
with
such
a
wildwood
charm
as
that,
would
be
a
good
enough
substitute
for
coffee.
While
Joe
was
slicing
bacon
for
breakfast,
Tom
and
Huck
asked
him
to
hold
on
a
minute;
they
stepped
to
a
promising
nook
in
the
river-bank
and
threw
in
their
lines;
almost
immediately
they
had
reward.
Joe
had
not
had
time
to
get
impatient
before
they
were
back
again
with
some
handsome
bass,
a
couple
of
sun-perch
and
a
small
catfish--provisions
enough
for
quite
a
family.
They
fried
the
fish
with
the
bacon,
and
were
astonished;
for
no
fish
had
ever
seemed
so
delicious
before.
They
did
not
know
that
the
quicker
a
fresh-water
fish
is
on
the
fire
after
he
is
caught
the
better
he
is;
and
they
reflected
little
upon
what
a
sauce
open-air
sleeping,
open-air
exercise,
bathing,
and
a
large
ingredient
of
hunger
make,
too.
They
lay
around
in
the
shade,
after
breakfast,
while
Huck
had
a
smoke,
and
then
went
off
through
the
woods
on
an
exploring
expedition.
They
tramped
gayly
along,
over
decaying
logs,
through
tangled
underbrush,
among
solemn
monarchs
of
the
forest,
hung
from
their
crowns
to
the
ground
with
a
drooping
regalia
of
grape-vines.
Now
and
then
they
came
upon
snug
nooks
carpeted
with
grass
and
jeweled
with
flowers.
They
found
plenty
of
things
to
be
delighted
with,
but
nothing
to
be
astonished
at.
They
discovered
that
the
island
was
about
three
miles
long
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide,
and
that
the
shore
it
lay
closest
to
was
only
separated
from
it
by
a
narrow
channel
hardly
two
hundred
yards
wide.
They
took
a
swim
about
every
hour,
so
it
was
close
upon
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
when
they
got
back
to
camp.
They
were
too
hungry
to
stop
to
fish,
but
they
fared
sumptuously
upon
cold
ham,
and
then
threw
themselves
down
in
the
shade
to
talk.
But
the
talk
soon
began
to
drag,
and
then
died.
The
stillness,
the
solemnity
that
brooded
in
the
woods,
and
the
sense
of
loneliness,
began
to
tell
upon
the
spirits
of
the
boys.
They
fell
to
thinking.
A
sort
of
undefined
longing
crept
upon
them.
This
took
dim
shape,
presently--it
was
budding
homesickness.
Even
Finn
the
Red-Handed
was
dreaming
of
his
doorsteps
and
empty
hogsheads.
But
they
were
all
ashamed
of
their
weakness,
and
none
was
brave
enough
to
speak
his
thought.
For
some
time,
now,
the
boys
had
been
dully
conscious
of
a
peculiar
sound
in
the
distance,
just
as
one
sometimes
is
of
the
ticking
of
a
clock
which
he
takes
no
distinct
note
of.
But
now
this
mysterious
sound
became
more
pronounced,
and
forced
a
recognition.
The
boys
started,
glanced
at
each
other,
and
then
each
assumed
a
listening
attitude.
There
was
a
long
silence,
profound
and
unbroken;
then
a
deep,
sullen
boom
came
floating
down
out
of
the
distance.
"What
is
it!"
exclaimed
Joe,
under
his
breath.
"I
wonder,"
said
Tom
in
a
whisper.
"'Tain't
thunder,"
said
Huckleberry,
in
an
awed
tone,
"becuz
thunder--"
"Hark!"
said
Tom.
"Listen--don't
talk."
They
waited
a
time
that
seemed
an
age,
and
then
the
same
muffled
boom
troubled
the
solemn
hush.
"Let's
go
and
see."
They
sprang
to
their
feet
and
hurried
to
the
shore
toward
the
town.
They
parted
the
bushes
on
the
bank
and
peered
out
over
the
water.
The
little
steam
ferryboat
was
about
a
mile
below
the
village,
drifting
with
the
current.
Her
broad
deck
seemed
crowded
with
people.
There
were
a
great
many
skiffs
rowing
about
or
floating
with
the
stream
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
ferryboat,
but
the
boys
could
not
determine
what
the
men
in
them
were
doing.
Presently
a
great
jet
of
white
smoke
burst
from
the
ferryboat's
side,
and
as
it
expanded
and
rose
in
a
lazy
cloud,
that
same
dull
throb
of
sound
was
borne
to
the
listeners
again.
"I
know
now!"
exclaimed
Tom;
"somebody's
drownded!"
"That's
it!"
said
Huck;
"they
done
that
last
summer,
when
Bill
Turner
got
drownded;
they
shoot
a
cannon
over
the
water,
and
that
makes
him
come
up
to
the
top.
Yes,
and
they
take
loaves
of
bread
and
put
quicksilver
in
'em
and
set
'em
afloat,
and
wherever
there's
anybody
that's
drownded,
they'll
float
right
there
and
stop."
"Yes,
I've
heard
about
that,"
said
Joe.
"I
wonder
what
makes
the
bread
do
that."
"Oh,
it
ain't
the
bread,
so
much,"
said
Tom;
"I
reckon
it's
mostly
what
they
SAY
over
it
before
they
start
it
out."
"But
they
don't
say
anything
over
it,"
said
Huck.
"I've
seen
'em
and
they
don't."
"Well,
that's
funny,"
said
Tom.
"But
maybe
they
say
it
to
themselves.
Of
COURSE
they
do.
Anybody
might
know
that."
The
other
boys
agreed
that
there
was
reason
in
what
Tom
said,
because
an
ignorant
lump
of
bread,
uninstructed
by
an
incantation,
could
not
be
expected
to
act
very
intelligently
when
set
upon
an
errand
of
such
gravity.
"By
jings,
I
wish
I
was
over
there,
now,"
said
Joe.
"I
do
too"
said
Huck
"I'd
give
heaps
to
know
who
it
is."
The
boys
still
listened
and
watched.
Presently
a
revealing
thought
flashed
through
Tom's
mind,
and
he
exclaimed:
"Boys,
I
know
who's
drownded--it's
us!"
They
felt
like
heroes
in
an
instant.
Here
was
a
gorgeous
triumph;
they
were
missed;
they
were
mourned;
hearts
were
breaking
on
their
account;
tears
were
being
shed;
accusing
memories
of
unkindness
to
these
poor
lost
lads
were
rising
up,
and
unavailing
regrets
and
remorse
were
being
indulged;
and
best
of
all,
the
departed
were
the
talk
of
the
whole
town,
and
the
envy
of
all
the
boys,
as
far
as
this
dazzling
notoriety
was
concerned.
This
was
fine.
It
was
worth
while
to
be
a
pirate,
after
all.
As
twilight
drew
on,
the
ferryboat
went
back
to
her
accustomed
business
and
the
skiffs
disappeared.
The
pirates
returned
to
camp.
They
were
jubilant
with
vanity
over
their
new
grandeur
and
the
illustrious
trouble
they
were
making.
They
caught
fish,
cooked
supper
and
ate
it,
and
then
fell
to
guessing
at
what
the
village
was
thinking
and
saying
about
them;
and
the
pictures
they
drew
of
the
public
distress
on
their
account
were
gratifying
to
look
upon--from
their
point
of
view.
But
when
the
shadows
of
night
closed
them
in,
they
gradually
ceased
to
talk,
and
sat
gazing
into
the
fire,
with
their
minds
evidently
wandering
elsewhere.
The
excitement
was
gone,
now,
and
Tom
and
Joe
could
not
keep
back
thoughts
of
certain
persons
at
home
who
were
not
enjoying
this
fine
frolic
as
much
as
they
were.
Misgivings
came;
they
grew
troubled
and
unhappy;
a
sigh
or
two
escaped,
unawares.
By
and
by
Joe
timidly
ventured
upon
a
roundabout
"feeler"
as
to
how
the
others
might
look
upon
a
return
to
civilization--not
right
now,
but--
Tom
withered
him
with
derision!
Huck,
being
uncommitted
as
yet,
joined
in
with
Tom,
and
the
waverer
quickly
"explained,"
and
was
glad
to
get
out
of
the
scrape
with
as
little
taint
of
chicken-hearted
homesickness
clinging
to
his
garments
as
he
could.
Mutiny
was
effectually
laid
to
rest
for
the
moment.
As
the
night
deepened,
Huck
began
to
nod,
and
presently
to
snore.
Joe
followed
next.
Tom
lay
upon
his
elbow
motionless,
for
some
time,
watching
the
two
intently.
At
last
he
got
up
cautiously,
on
his
knees,
and
went
searching
among
the
grass
and
the
flickering
reflections
flung
by
the
camp-fire.
He
picked
up
and
inspected
several
large
semi-cylinders
of
the
thin
white
bark
of
a
sycamore,
and
finally
chose
two
which
seemed
to
suit
him.
Then
he
knelt
by
the
fire
and
painfully
wrote
something
upon
each
of
these
with
his
"red
keel";
one
he
rolled
up
and
put
in
his
jacket
pocket,
and
the
other
he
put
in
Joe's
hat
and
removed
it
to
a
little
distance
from
the
owner.
And
he
also
put
into
the
hat
certain
schoolboy
treasures
of
almost
inestimable
value--among
them
a
lump
of
chalk,
an
India-rubber
ball,
three
fishhooks,
and
one
of
that
kind
of
marbles
known
as
a
"sure
'nough
crystal."
Then
he
tiptoed
his
way
cautiously
among
the
trees
till
he
felt
that
he
was
out
of
hearing,
and
straightway
broke
into
a
keen
run
in
the
direction
of
the
sandbar.
CHAPTER
XV
A
FEW
minutes
later
Tom
was
in
the
shoal
water
of
the
bar,
wading
toward
the
Illinois
shore.
Before
the
depth
reached
his
middle
he
was
half-way
over;
the
current
would
permit
no
more
wading,
now,
so
he
struck
out
confidently
to
swim
the
remaining
hundred
yards.
He
swam
quartering
upstream,
but
still
was
swept
downward
rather
faster
than
he
had
expected.
However,
he
reached
the
shore
finally,
and
drifted
along
till
he
found
a
low
place
and
drew
himself
out.
He
put
his
hand
on
his
jacket
pocket,
found
his
piece
of
bark
safe,
and
then
struck
through
the
woods,
following
the
shore,
with
streaming
garments.
Shortly
before
ten
o'clock
he
came
out
into
an
open
place
opposite
the
village,
and
saw
the
ferryboat
lying
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
and
the
high
bank.
Everything
was
quiet
under
the
blinking
stars.
He
crept
down
the
bank,
watching
with
all
his
eyes,
slipped
into
the
water,
swam
three
or
four
strokes
and
climbed
into
the
skiff
that
did
"yawl"
duty
at
the
boat's
stern.
He
laid
himself
down
under
the
thwarts
and
waited,
panting.
Presently
the
cracked
bell
tapped
and
a
voice
gave
the
order
to
"cast
off."
A
minute
or
two
later
the
skiff's
head
was
standing
high
up,
against
the
boat's
swell,
and
the
voyage
was
begun.
Tom
felt
happy
in
his
success,
for
he
knew
it
was
the
boat's
last
trip
for
the
night.
At
the
end
of
a
long
twelve
or
fifteen
minutes
the
wheels
stopped,
and
Tom
slipped
overboard
and
swam
ashore
in
the
dusk,
landing
fifty
yards
downstream,
out
of
danger
of
possible
stragglers.
He
flew
along
unfrequented
alleys,
and
shortly
found
himself
at
his
aunt's
back
fence.
He
climbed
over,
approached
the
"ell,"
and
looked
in
at
the
sitting-room
window,
for
a
light
was
burning
there.
There
sat
Aunt
Polly,
Sid,
Mary,
and
Joe
Harper's
mother,
grouped
together,
talking.
They
were
by
the
bed,
and
the
bed
was
between
them
and
the
door.
Tom
went
to
the
door
and
began
to
softly
lift
the
latch;
then
he
pressed
gently
and
the
door
yielded
a
crack;
he
continued
pushing
cautiously,
and
quaking
every
time
it
creaked,
till
he
judged
he
might
squeeze
through
on
his
knees;
so
he
put
his
head
through
and
began,
warily.
"What
makes
the
candle
blow
so?"
said
Aunt
Polly.
Tom
hurried
up.
"Why,
that
door's
open,
I
believe.
Why,
of
course
it
is.
No
end
of
strange
things
now.
Go
'long
and
shut
it,
Sid."
Tom
disappeared
under
the
bed
just
in
time.
He
lay
and
"breathed"
himself
for
a
time,
and
then
crept
to
where
he
could
almost
touch
his
aunt's
foot.
"But
as
I
was
saying,"
said
Aunt
Polly,
"he
warn't
BAD,
so
to
say
--only
mischEEvous.
Only
just
giddy,
and
harum-scarum,
you
know.
He
warn't
any
more
responsible
than
a
colt.
HE
never
meant
any
harm,
and
he
was
the
best-hearted
boy
that
ever
was"--and
she
began
to
cry.
"It
was
just
so
with
my
Joe--always
full
of
his
devilment,
and
up
to
every
kind
of
mischief,
but
he
was
just
as
unselfish
and
kind
as
he
could
be--and
laws
bless
me,
to
think
I
went
and
whipped
him
for
taking
that
cream,
never
once
recollecting
that
I
throwed
it
out
myself
because
it
was
sour,
and
I
never
to
see
him
again
in
this
world,
never,
never,
never,
poor
abused
boy!"
And
Mrs.
Harper
sobbed
as
if
her
heart
would
break.
"I
hope
Tom's
better
off
where
he
is,"
said
Sid,
"but
if
he'd
been
better
in
some
ways--"
"SID!"
Tom
felt
the
glare
of
the
old
lady's
eye,
though
he
could
not
see
it.
"Not
a
word
against
my
Tom,
now
that
he's
gone!
God'll
take
care
of
HIM--never
you
trouble
YOURself,
sir!
Oh,
Mrs.
Harper,
I
don't
know
how
to
give
him
up!
I
don't
know
how
to
give
him
up!
He
was
such
a
comfort
to
me,
although
he
tormented
my
old
heart
out
of
me,
'most."
"The
Lord
giveth
and
the
Lord
hath
taken
away--Blessed
be
the
name
of
the
Lord!
But
it's
so
hard--Oh,
it's
so
hard!
Only
last
Saturday
my
Joe
busted
a
firecracker
right
under
my
nose
and
I
knocked
him
sprawling.
Little
did
I
know
then,
how
soon--Oh,
if
it
was
to
do
over
again
I'd
hug
him
and
bless
him
for
it."
"Yes,
yes,
yes,
I
know
just
how
you
feel,
Mrs.
Harper,
I
know
just
exactly
how
you
feel.
No
longer
ago
than
yesterday
noon,
my
Tom
took
and
filled
the
cat
full
of
Pain-killer,
and
I
did
think
the
cretur
would
tear
the
house
down.
And
God
forgive
me,
I
cracked
Tom's
head
with
my
thimble,
poor
boy,
poor
dead
boy.
But
he's
out
of
all
his
troubles
now.
And
the
last
words
I
ever
heard
him
say
was
to
reproach--"
But
this
memory
was
too
much
for
the
old
lady,
and
she
broke
entirely
down.
Tom
was
snuffling,
now,
himself--and
more
in
pity
of
himself
than
anybody
else.
He
could
hear
Mary
crying,
and
putting
in
a
kindly
word
for
him
from
time
to
time.
He
began
to
have
a
nobler
opinion
of
himself
than
ever
before.
Still,
he
was
sufficiently
touched
by
his
aunt's
grief
to
long
to
rush
out
from
under
the
bed
and
overwhelm
her
with
joy--and
the
theatrical
gorgeousness
of
the
thing
appealed
strongly
to
his
nature,
too,
but
he
resisted
and
lay
still.
He
went
on
listening,
and
gathered
by
odds
and
ends
that
it
was
conjectured
at
first
that
the
boys
had
got
drowned
while
taking
a
swim;
then
the
small
raft
had
been
missed;
next,
certain
boys
said
the
missing
lads
had
promised
that
the
village
should
"hear
something"
soon;
the
wise-heads
had
"put
this
and
that
together"
and
decided
that
the
lads
had
gone
off
on
that
raft
and
would
turn
up
at
the
next
town
below,
presently;
but
toward
noon
the
raft
had
been
found,
lodged
against
the
Missouri
shore
some
five
or
six
miles
below
the
village
--and
then
hope
perished;
they
must
be
drowned,
else
hunger
would
have
driven
them
home
by
nightfall
if
not
sooner.
It
was
believed
that
the
search
for
the
bodies
had
been
a
fruitless
effort
merely
because
the
drowning
must
have
occurred
in
mid-channel,
since
the
boys,
being
good
swimmers,
would
otherwise
have
escaped
to
shore.
This
was
Wednesday
night.
If
the
bodies
continued
missing
until
Sunday,
all
hope
would
be
given
over,
and
the
funerals
would
be
preached
on
that
morning.
Tom
shuddered.
Mrs.
Harper
gave
a
sobbing
good-night
and
turned
to
go.
Then
with
a
mutual
impulse
the
two
bereaved
women
flung
themselves
into
each
other's
arms
and
had
a
good,
consoling
cry,
and
then
parted.
Aunt
Polly
was
tender
far
beyond
her
wont,
in
her
good-night
to
Sid
and
Mary.
Sid
snuffled
a
bit
and
Mary
went
off
crying
with
all
her
heart.
Aunt
Polly
knelt
down
and
prayed
for
Tom
so
touchingly,
so
appealingly,
and
with
such
measureless
love
in
her
words
and
her
old
trembling
voice,
that
he
was
weltering
in
tears
again,
long
before
she
was
through.
He
had
to
keep
still
long
after
she
went
to
bed,
for
she
kept
making
broken-hearted
ejaculations
from
time
to
time,
tossing
unrestfully,
and
turning
over.
But
at
last
she
was
still,
only
moaning
a
little
in
her
sleep.
Now
the
boy
stole
out,
rose
gradually
by
the
bedside,
shaded
the
candle-light
with
his
hand,
and
stood
regarding
her.
His
heart
was
full
of
pity
for
her.
He
took
out
his
sycamore
scroll
and
placed
it
by
the
candle.
But
something
occurred
to
him,
and
he
lingered
considering.
His
face
lighted
with
a
happy
solution
of
his
thought;
he
put
the
bark
hastily
in
his
pocket.
Then
he
bent
over
and
kissed
the
faded
lips,
and
straightway
made
his
stealthy
exit,
latching
the
door
behind
him.
He
threaded
his
way
back
to
the
ferry
landing,
found
nobody
at
large
there,
and
walked
boldly
on
board
the
boat,
for
he
knew
she
was
tenantless
except
that
there
was
a
watchman,
who
always
turned
in
and
slept
like
a
graven
image.
He
untied
the
skiff
at
the
stern,
slipped
into
it,
and
was
soon
rowing
cautiously
upstream.
When
he
had
pulled
a
mile
above
the
village,
he
started
quartering
across
and
bent
himself
stoutly
to
his
work.
He
hit
the
landing
on
the
other
side
neatly,
for
this
was
a
familiar
bit
of
work
to
him.
He
was
moved
to
capture
the
skiff,
arguing
that
it
might
be
considered
a
ship
and
therefore
legitimate
prey
for
a
pirate,
but
he
knew
a
thorough
search
would
be
made
for
it
and
that
might
end
in
revelations.
So
he
stepped
ashore
and
entered
the
woods.
He
sat
down
and
took
a
long
rest,
torturing
himself
meanwhile
to
keep
awake,
and
then
started
warily
down
the
home-stretch.
The
night
was
far
spent.
It
was
broad
daylight
before
he
found
himself
fairly
abreast
the
island
bar.
He
rested
again
until
the
sun
was
well
up
and
gilding
the
great
river
with
its
splendor,
and
then
he
plunged
into
the
stream.
A
little
later
he
paused,
dripping,
upon
the
threshold
of
the
camp,
and
heard
Joe
say:
"No,
Tom's
true-blue,
Huck,
and
he'll
come
back.
He
won't
desert.
He
knows
that
would
be
a
disgrace
to
a
pirate,
and
Tom's
too
proud
for
that
sort
of
thing.
He's
up
to
something
or
other.
Now
I
wonder
what?"
"Well,
the
things
is
ours,
anyway,
ain't
they?"
"Pretty
near,
but
not
yet,
Huck.
The
writing
says
they
are
if
he
ain't
back
here
to
breakfast."
"Which
he
is!"
exclaimed
Tom,
with
fine
dramatic
effect,
stepping
grandly
into
camp.
A
sumptuous
breakfast
of
bacon
and
fish
was
shortly
provided,
and
as
the
boys
set
to
work
upon
it,
Tom
recounted
(and
adorned)
his
adventures.
They
were
a
vain
and
boastful
company
of
heroes
when
the
tale
was
done.
Then
Tom
hid
himself
away
in
a
shady
nook
to
sleep
till
noon,
and
the
other
pirates
got
ready
to
fish
and
explore.
CHAPTER
XVI
AFTER
dinner
all
the
gang
turned
out
to
hunt
for
turtle
eggs
on
the
bar.
They
went
about
poking
sticks
into
the
sand,
and
when
they
found
a
soft
place
they
went
down
on
their
knees
and
dug
with
their
hands.
Sometimes
they
would
take
fifty
or
sixty
eggs
out
of
one
hole.
They
were
perfectly
round
white
things
a
trifle
smaller
than
an
English
walnut.
They
had
a
famous
fried-egg
feast
that
night,
and
another
on
Friday
morning.
After
breakfast
they
went
whooping
and
prancing
out
on
the
bar,
and
chased
each
other
round
and
round,
shedding
clothes
as
they
went,
until
they
were
naked,
and
then
continued
the
frolic
far
away
up
the
shoal
water
of
the
bar,
against
the
stiff
current,
which
latter
tripped
their
legs
from
under
them
from
time
to
time
and
greatly
increased
the
fun.
And
now
and
then
they
stooped
in
a
group
and
splashed
water
in
each
other's
faces
with
their
palms,
gradually
approaching
each
other,
with
averted
faces
to
avoid
the
strangling
sprays,
and
finally
gripping
and
struggling
till
the
best
man
ducked
his
neighbor,
and
then
they
all
went
under
in
a
tangle
of
white
legs
and
arms
and
came
up
blowing,
sputtering,
laughing,
and
gasping
for
breath
at
one
and
the
same
time.
When
they
were
well
exhausted,
they
would
run
out
and
sprawl
on
the
dry,
hot
sand,
and
lie
there
and
cover
themselves
up
with
it,
and
by
and
by
break
for
the
water
again
and
go
through
the
original
performance
once
more.
Finally
it
occurred
to
them
that
their
naked
skin
represented
flesh-colored
"tights"
very
fairly;
so
they
drew
a
ring
in
the
sand
and
had
a
circus--with
three
clowns
in
it,
for
none
would
yield
this
proudest
post
to
his
neighbor.
Next
they
got
their
marbles
and
played
"knucks"
and
"ring-taw"
and
"keeps"
till
that
amusement
grew
stale.
Then
Joe
and
Huck
had
another
swim,
but
Tom
would
not
venture,
because
he
found
that
in
kicking
off
his
trousers
he
had
kicked
his
string
of
rattlesnake
rattles
off
his
ankle,
and
he
wondered
how
he
had
escaped
cramp
so
long
without
the
protection
of
this
mysterious
charm.
He
did
not
venture
again
until
he
had
found
it,
and
by
that
time
the
other
boys
were
tired
and
ready
to
rest.
They
gradually
wandered
apart,
dropped
into
the
"dumps,"
and
fell
to
gazing
longingly
across
the
wide
river
to
where
the
village
lay
drowsing
in
the
sun.
Tom
found
himself
writing
"BECKY"
in
the
sand
with
his
big
toe;
he
scratched
it
out,
and
was
angry
with
himself
for
his
weakness.
But
he
wrote
it
again,
nevertheless;
he
could
not
help
it.
He
erased
it
once
more
and
then
took
himself
out
of
temptation
by
driving
the
other
boys
together
and
joining
them.
But
Joe's
spirits
had
gone
down
almost
beyond
resurrection.
He
was
so
homesick
that
he
could
hardly
endure
the
misery
of
it.
The
tears
lay
very
near
the
surface.
Huck
was
melancholy,
too.
Tom
was
downhearted,
but
tried
hard
not
to
show
it.
He
had
a
secret
which
he
was
not
ready
to
tell,
yet,
but
if
this
mutinous
depression
was
not
broken
up
soon,
he
would
have
to
bring
it
out.
He
said,
with
a
great
show
of
cheerfulness:
"I
bet
there's
been
pirates
on
this
island
before,
boys.
We'll
explore
it
again.
They've
hid
treasures
here
somewhere.
How'd
you
feel
to
light
on
a
rotten
chest
full
of
gold
and
silver--hey?"
But
it
roused
only
faint
enthusiasm,
which
faded
out,
with
no
reply.
Tom
tried
one
or
two
other
seductions;
but
they
failed,
too.
It
was
discouraging
work.
Joe
sat
poking
up
the
sand
with
a
stick
and
looking
very
gloomy.
Finally
he
said:
"Oh,
boys,
let's
give
it
up.
I
want
to
go
home.
It's
so
lonesome."
"Oh
no,
Joe,
you'll
feel
better
by
and
by,"
said
Tom.
"Just
think
of
the
fishing
that's
here."
"I
don't
care
for
fishing.
I
want
to
go
home."
"But,
Joe,
there
ain't
such
another
swimming-place
anywhere."
"Swimming's
no
good.
I
don't
seem
to
care
for
it,
somehow,
when
there
ain't
anybody
to
say
I
sha'n't
go
in.
I
mean
to
go
home."
"Oh,
shucks!
Baby!
You
want
to
see
your
mother,
I
reckon."
"Yes,
I
DO
want
to
see
my
mother--and
you
would,
too,
if
you
had
one.
I
ain't
any
more
baby
than
you
are."
And
Joe
snuffled
a
little.
"Well,
we'll
let
the
cry-baby
go
home
to
his
mother,
won't
we,
Huck?
Poor
thing--does
it
want
to
see
its
mother?
And
so
it
shall.
You
like
it
here,
don't
you,
Huck?
We'll
stay,
won't
we?"
Huck
said,
"Y-e-s"--without
any
heart
in
it.
"I'll
never
speak
to
you
again
as
long
as
I
live,"
said
Joe,
rising.
"There
now!"
And
he
moved
moodily
away
and
began
to
dress
himself.
"Who
cares!"
said
Tom.
"Nobody
wants
you
to.
Go
'long
home
and
get
laughed
at.
Oh,
you're
a
nice
pirate.
Huck
and
me
ain't
cry-babies.
We'll
stay,
won't
we,
Huck?
Let
him
go
if
he
wants
to.
I
reckon
we
can
get
along
without
him,
per'aps."
But
Tom
was
uneasy,
nevertheless,
and
was
alarmed
to
see
Joe
go
sullenly
on
with
his
dressing.
And
then
it
was
discomforting
to
see
Huck
eying
Joe's
preparations
so
wistfully,
and
keeping
up
such
an
ominous
silence.
Presently,
without
a
parting
word,
Joe
began
to
wade
off
toward
the
Illinois
shore.
Tom's
heart
began
to
sink.
He
glanced
at
Huck.
Huck
could
not
bear
the
look,
and
dropped
his
eyes.
Then
he
said:
"I
want
to
go,
too,
Tom.
It
was
getting
so
lonesome
anyway,
and
now
it'll
be
worse.
Let's
us
go,
too,
Tom."
"I
won't!
You
can
all
go,
if
you
want
to.
I
mean
to
stay."
"Tom,
I
better
go."
"Well,
go
'long--who's
hendering
you."
Huck
began
to
pick
up
his
scattered
clothes.
He
said:
"Tom,
I
wisht
you'd
come,
too.
Now
you
think
it
over.
We'll
wait
for
you
when
we
get
to
shore."
"Well,
you'll
wait
a
blame
long
time,
that's
all."
Huck
started
sorrowfully
away,
and
Tom
stood
looking
after
him,
with
a
strong
desire
tugging
at
his
heart
to
yield
his
pride
and
go
along
too.
He
hoped
the
boys
would
stop,
but
they
still
waded
slowly
on.
It
suddenly
dawned
on
Tom
that
it
was
become
very
lonely
and
still.
He
made
one
final
struggle
with
his
pride,
and
then
darted
after
his
comrades,
yelling:
"Wait!
Wait!
I
want
to
tell
you
something!"
They
presently
stopped
and
turned
around.
When
he
got
to
where
they
were,
he
began
unfolding
his
secret,
and
they
listened
moodily
till
at
last
they
saw
the
"point"
he
was
driving
at,
and
then
they
set
up
a
war-whoop
of
applause
and
said
it
was
"splendid!"
and
said
if
he
had
told
them
at
first,
they
wouldn't
have
started
away.
He
made
a
plausible
excuse;
but
his
real
reason
had
been
the
fear
that
not
even
the
secret
would
keep
them
with
him
any
very
great
length
of
time,
and
so
he
had
meant
to
hold
it
in
reserve
as
a
last
seduction.
The
lads
came
gayly
back
and
went
at
their
sports
again
with
a
will,
chattering
all
the
time
about
Tom's
stupendous
plan
and
admiring
the
genius
of
it.
After
a
dainty
egg
and
fish
dinner,
Tom
said
he
wanted
to
learn
to
smoke,
now.
Joe
caught
at
the
idea
and
said
he
would
like
to
try,
too.
So
Huck
made
pipes
and
filled
them.
These
novices
had
never
smoked
anything
before
but
cigars
made
of
grape-vine,
and
they
"bit"
the
tongue,
and
were
not
considered
manly
anyway.
Now
they
stretched
themselves
out
on
their
elbows
and
began
to
puff,
charily,
and
with
slender
confidence.
The
smoke
had
an
unpleasant
taste,
and
they
gagged
a
little,
but
Tom
said:
"Why,
it's
just
as
easy!
If
I'd
a
knowed
this
was
all,
I'd
a
learnt
long
ago."
"So
would
I,"
said
Joe.
"It's
just
nothing."
"Why,
many
a
time
I've
looked
at
people
smoking,
and
thought
well
I
wish
I
could
do
that;
but
I
never
thought
I
could,"
said
Tom.
"That's
just
the
way
with
me,
hain't
it,
Huck?
You've
heard
me
talk
just
that
way--haven't
you,
Huck?
I'll
leave
it
to
Huck
if
I
haven't."
"Yes--heaps
of
times,"
said
Huck.
"Well,
I
have
too,"
said
Tom;
"oh,
hundreds
of
times.
Once
down
by
the
slaughter-house.
Don't
you
remember,
Huck?
Bob
Tanner
was
there,
and
Johnny
Miller,
and
Jeff
Thatcher,
when
I
said
it.
Don't
you
remember,
Huck,
'bout
me
saying
that?"
"Yes,
that's
so,"
said
Huck.
"That
was
the
day
after
I
lost
a
white
alley.
No,
'twas
the
day
before."
"There--I
told
you
so,"
said
Tom.
"Huck
recollects
it."
"I
bleeve
I
could
smoke
this
pipe
all
day,"
said
Joe.
"I
don't
feel
sick."
"Neither
do
I,"
said
Tom.
"I
could
smoke
it
all
day.
But
I
bet
you
Jeff
Thatcher
couldn't."
"Jeff
Thatcher!
Why,
he'd
keel
over
just
with
two
draws.
Just
let
him
try
it
once.
HE'D
see!"
"I
bet
he
would.
And
Johnny
Miller--I
wish
could
see
Johnny
Miller
tackle
it
once."
"Oh,
don't
I!"
said
Joe.
"Why,
I
bet
you
Johnny
Miller
couldn't
any
more
do
this
than
nothing.
Just
one
little
snifter
would
fetch
HIM."
"'Deed
it
would,
Joe.
Say--I
wish
the
boys
could
see
us
now."
"So
do
I."
"Say--boys,
don't
say
anything
about
it,
and
some
time
when
they're
around,
I'll
come
up
to
you
and
say,
'Joe,
got
a
pipe?
I
want
a
smoke.'
And
you'll
say,
kind
of
careless
like,
as
if
it
warn't
anything,
you'll
say,
'Yes,
I
got
my
OLD
pipe,
and
another
one,
but
my
tobacker
ain't
very
good.'
And
I'll
say,
'Oh,
that's
all
right,
if
it's
STRONG
enough.'
And
then
you'll
out
with
the
pipes,
and
we'll
light
up
just
as
ca'm,
and
then
just
see
'em
look!"
"By
jings,
that'll
be
gay,
Tom!
I
wish
it
was
NOW!"
"So
do
I!
And
when
we
tell
'em
we
learned
when
we
was
off
pirating,
won't
they
wish
they'd
been
along?"
"Oh,
I
reckon
not!
I'll
just
BET
they
will!"
So
the
talk
ran
on.
But
presently
it
began
to
flag
a
trifle,
and
grow
disjointed.
The
silences
widened;
the
expectoration
marvellously
increased.
Every
pore
inside
the
boys'
cheeks
became
a
spouting
fountain;
they
could
scarcely
bail
out
the
cellars
under
their
tongues
fast
enough
to
prevent
an
inundation;
little
overflowings
down
their
throats
occurred
in
spite
of
all
they
could
do,
and
sudden
retchings
followed
every
time.
Both
boys
were
looking
very
pale
and
miserable,
now.
Joe's
pipe
dropped
from
his
nerveless
fingers.
Tom's
followed.
Both
fountains
were
going
furiously
and
both
pumps
bailing
with
might
and
main.
Joe
said
feebly:
"I've
lost
my
knife.
I
reckon
I
better
go
and
find
it."
Tom
said,
with
quivering
lips
and
halting
utterance:
"I'll
help
you.
You
go
over
that
way
and
I'll
hunt
around
by
the
spring.
No,
you
needn't
come,
Huck--we
can
find
it."
So
Huck
sat
down
again,
and
waited
an
hour.
Then
he
found
it
lonesome,
and
went
to
find
his
comrades.
They
were
wide
apart
in
the
woods,
both
very
pale,
both
fast
asleep.
But
something
informed
him
that
if
they
had
had
any
trouble
they
had
got
rid
of
it.
They
were
not
talkative
at
supper
that
night.
They
had
a
humble
look,
and
when
Huck
prepared
his
pipe
after
the
meal
and
was
going
to
prepare
theirs,
they
said
no,
they
were
not
feeling
very
well--something
they
ate
at
dinner
had
disagreed
with
them.
About
midnight
Joe
awoke,
and
called
the
boys.
There
was
a
brooding
oppressiveness
in
the
air
that
seemed
to
bode
something.
The
boys
huddled
themselves
together
and
sought
the
friendly
companionship
of
the
fire,
though
the
dull
dead
heat
of
the
breathless
atmosphere
was
stifling.
They
sat
still,
intent
and
waiting.
The
solemn
hush
continued.
Beyond
the
light
of
the
fire
everything
was
swallowed
up
in
the
blackness
of
darkness.
Presently
there
came
a
quivering
glow
that
vaguely
revealed
the
foliage
for
a
moment
and
then
vanished.
By
and
by
another
came,
a
little
stronger.
Then
another.
Then
a
faint
moan
came
sighing
through
the
branches
of
the
forest
and
the
boys
felt
a
fleeting
breath
upon
their
cheeks,
and
shuddered
with
the
fancy
that
the
Spirit
of
the
Night
had
gone
by.
There
was
a
pause.
Now
a
weird
flash
turned
night
into
day
and
showed
every
little
grass-blade,
separate
and
distinct,
that
grew
about
their
feet.
And
it
showed
three
white,
startled
faces,
too.
A
deep
peal
of
thunder
went
rolling
and
tumbling
down
the
heavens
and
lost
itself
in
sullen
rumblings
in
the
distance.
A
sweep
of
chilly
air
passed
by,
rustling
all
the
leaves
and
snowing
the
flaky
ashes
broadcast
about
the
fire.
Another
fierce
glare
lit
up
the
forest
and
an
instant
crash
followed
that
seemed
to
rend
the
tree-tops
right
over
the
boys'
heads.
They
clung
together
in
terror,
in
the
thick
gloom
that
followed.
A
few
big
rain-drops
fell
pattering
upon
the
leaves.
"Quick!
boys,
go
for
the
tent!"
exclaimed
Tom.
They
sprang
away,
stumbling
over
roots
and
among
vines
in
the
dark,
no
two
plunging
in
the
same
direction.
A
furious
blast
roared
through
the
trees,
making
everything
sing
as
it
went.
One
blinding
flash
after
another
came,
and
peal
on
peal
of
deafening
thunder.
And
now
a
drenching
rain
poured
down
and
the
rising
hurricane
drove
it
in
sheets
along
the
ground.
The
boys
cried
out
to
each
other,
but
the
roaring
wind
and
the
booming
thunder-blasts
drowned
their
voices
utterly.
However,
one
by
one
they
straggled
in
at
last
and
took
shelter
under
the
tent,
cold,
scared,
and
streaming
with
water;
but
to
have
company
in
misery
seemed
something
to
be
grateful
for.
They
could
not
talk,
the
old
sail
flapped
so
furiously,
even
if
the
other
noises
would
have
allowed
them.
The
tempest
rose
higher
and
higher,
and
presently
the
sail
tore
loose
from
its
fastenings
and
went
winging
away
on
the
blast.
The
boys
seized
each
others'
hands
and
fled,
with
many
tumblings
and
bruises,
to
the
shelter
of
a
great
oak
that
stood
upon
the
river-bank.
Now
the
battle
was
at
its
highest.
Under
the
ceaseless
conflagration
of
lightning
that
flamed
in
the
skies,
everything
below
stood
out
in
clean-cut
and
shadowless
distinctness:
the
bending
trees,
the
billowy
river,
white
with
foam,
the
driving
spray
of
spume-flakes,
the
dim
outlines
of
the
high
bluffs
on
the
other
side,
glimpsed
through
the
drifting
cloud-rack
and
the
slanting
veil
of
rain.
Every
little
while
some
giant
tree
yielded
the
fight
and
fell
crashing
through
the
younger
growth;
and
the
unflagging
thunder-peals
came
now
in
ear-splitting
explosive
bursts,
keen
and
sharp,
and
unspeakably
appalling.
The
storm
culminated
in
one
matchless
effort
that
seemed
likely
to
tear
the
island
to
pieces,
burn
it
up,
drown
it
to
the
tree-tops,
blow
it
away,
and
deafen
every
creature
in
it,
all
at
one
and
the
same
moment.
It
was
a
wild
night
for
homeless
young
heads
to
be
out
in.
But
at
last
the
battle
was
done,
and
the
forces
retired
with
weaker
and
weaker
threatenings
and
grumblings,
and
peace
resumed
her
sway.
The
boys
went
back
to
camp,
a
good
deal
awed;
but
they
found
there
was
still
something
to
be
thankful
for,
because
the
great
sycamore,
the
shelter
of
their
beds,
was
a
ruin,
now,
blasted
by
the
lightnings,
and
they
were
not
under
it
when
the
catastrophe
happened.
Everything
in
camp
was
drenched,
the
camp-fire
as
well;
for
they
were
but
heedless
lads,
like
their
generation,
and
had
made
no
provision
against
rain.
Here
was
matter
for
dismay,
for
they
were
soaked
through
and
chilled.
They
were
eloquent
in
their
distress;
but
they
presently
discovered
that
the
fire
had
eaten
so
far
up
under
the
great
log
it
had
been
built
against
(where
it
curved
upward
and
separated
itself
from
the
ground),
that
a
handbreadth
or
so
of
it
had
escaped
wetting;
so
they
patiently
wrought
until,
with
shreds
and
bark
gathered
from
the
under
sides
of
sheltered
logs,
they
coaxed
the
fire
to
burn
again.
Then
they
piled
on
great
dead
boughs
till
they
had
a
roaring
furnace,
and
were
glad-hearted
once
more.
They
dried
their
boiled
ham
and
had
a
feast,
and
after
that
they
sat
by
the
fire
and
expanded
and
glorified
their
midnight
adventure
until
morning,
for
there
was
not
a
dry
spot
to
sleep
on,
anywhere
around.
As
the
sun
began
to
steal
in
upon
the
boys,
drowsiness
came
over
them,
and
they
went
out
on
the
sandbar
and
lay
down
to
sleep.
They
got
scorched
out
by
and
by,
and
drearily
set
about
getting
breakfast.
After
the
meal
they
felt
rusty,
and
stiff-jointed,
and
a
little
homesick
once
more.
Tom
saw
the
signs,
and
fell
to
cheering
up
the
pirates
as
well
as
he
could.
But
they
cared
nothing
for
marbles,
or
circus,
or
swimming,
or
anything.
He
reminded
them
of
the
imposing
secret,
and
raised
a
ray
of
cheer.
While
it
lasted,
he
got
them
interested
in
a
new
device.
This
was
to
knock
off
being
pirates,
for
a
while,
and
be
Indians
for
a
change.
They
were
attracted
by
this
idea;
so
it
was
not
long
before
they
were
stripped,
and
striped
from
head
to
heel
with
black
mud,
like
so
many
zebras--all
of
them
chiefs,
of
course--and
then
they
went
tearing
through
the
woods
to
attack
an
English
settlement.
By
and
by
they
separated
into
three
hostile
tribes,
and
darted
upon
each
other
from
ambush
with
dreadful
war-whoops,
and
killed
and
scalped
each
other
by
thousands.
It
was
a
gory
day.
Consequently
it
was
an
extremely
satisfactory
one.
They
assembled
in
camp
toward
supper-time,
hungry
and
happy;
but
now
a
difficulty
arose--hostile
Indians
could
not
break
the
bread
of
hospitality
together
without
first
making
peace,
and
this
was
a
simple
impossibility
without
smoking
a
pipe
of
peace.
There
was
no
other
process
that
ever
they
had
heard
of.
Two
of
the
savages
almost
wished
they
had
remained
pirates.
However,
there
was
no
other
way;
so
with
such
show
of
cheerfulness
as
they
could
muster
they
called
for
the
pipe
and
took
their
whiff
as
it
passed,
in
due
form.
And
behold,
they
were
glad
they
had
gone
into
savagery,
for
they
had
gained
something;
they
found
that
they
could
now
smoke
a
little
without
having
to
go
and
hunt
for
a
lost
knife;
they
did
not
get
sick
enough
to
be
seriously
uncomfortable.
They
were
not
likely
to
fool
away
this
high
promise
for
lack
of
effort.
No,
they
practised
cautiously,
after
supper,
with
right
fair
success,
and
so
they
spent
a
jubilant
evening.
They
were
prouder
and
happier
in
their
new
acquirement
than
they
would
have
been
in
the
scalping
and
skinning
of
the
Six
Nations.
We
will
leave
them
to
smoke
and
chatter
and
brag,
since
we
have
no
further
use
for
them
at
present.
CHAPTER
XVII
BUT
there
was
no
hilarity
in
the
little
town
that
same
tranquil
Saturday
afternoon.
The
Harpers,
and
Aunt
Polly's
family,
were
being
put
into
mourning,
with
great
grief
and
many
tears.
An
unusual
quiet
possessed
the
village,
although
it
was
ordinarily
quiet
enough,
in
all
conscience.
The
villagers
conducted
their
concerns
with
an
absent
air,
and
talked
little;
but
they
sighed
often.
The
Saturday
holiday
seemed
a
burden
to
the
children.
They
had
no
heart
in
their
sports,
and
gradually
gave
them
up.
In
the
afternoon
Becky
Thatcher
found
herself
moping
about
the
deserted
schoolhouse
yard,
and
feeling
very
melancholy.
But
she
found
nothing
there
to
comfort
her.
She
soliloquized:
"Oh,
if
I
only
had
a
brass
andiron-knob
again!
But
I
haven't
got
anything
now
to
remember
him
by."
And
she
choked
back
a
little
sob.
Presently
she
stopped,
and
said
to
herself:
"It
was
right
here.
Oh,
if
it
was
to
do
over
again,
I
wouldn't
say
that--I
wouldn't
say
it
for
the
whole
world.
But
he's
gone
now;
I'll
never,
never,
never
see
him
any
more."
This
thought
broke
her
down,
and
she
wandered
away,
with
tears
rolling
down
her
cheeks.
Then
quite
a
group
of
boys
and
girls--playmates
of
Tom's
and
Joe's--came
by,
and
stood
looking
over
the
paling
fence
and
talking
in
reverent
tones
of
how
Tom
did
so-and-so
the
last
time
they
saw
him,
and
how
Joe
said
this
and
that
small
trifle
(pregnant
with
awful
prophecy,
as
they
could
easily
see
now!)--and
each
speaker
pointed
out
the
exact
spot
where
the
lost
lads
stood
at
the
time,
and
then
added
something
like
"and
I
was
a-standing
just
so--just
as
I
am
now,
and
as
if
you
was
him--I
was
as
close
as
that--and
he
smiled,
just
this
way--and
then
something
seemed
to
go
all
over
me,
like--awful,
you
know--and
I
never
thought
what
it
meant,
of
course,
but
I
can
see
now!"
Then
there
was
a
dispute
about
who
saw
the
dead
boys
last
in
life,
and
many
claimed
that
dismal
distinction,
and
offered
evidences,
more
or
less
tampered
with
by
the
witness;
and
when
it
was
ultimately
decided
who
DID
see
the
departed
last,
and
exchanged
the
last
words
with
them,
the
lucky
parties
took
upon
themselves
a
sort
of
sacred
importance,
and
were
gaped
at
and
envied
by
all
the
rest.
One
poor
chap,
who
had
no
other
grandeur
to
offer,
said
with
tolerably
manifest
pride
in
the
remembrance:
"Well,
Tom
Sawyer
he
licked
me
once."
But
that
bid
for
glory
was
a
failure.
Most
of
the
boys
could
say
that,
and
so
that
cheapened
the
distinction
too
much.
The
group
loitered
away,
still
recalling
memories
of
the
lost
heroes,
in
awed
voices.
When
the
Sunday-school
hour
was
finished,
the
next
morning,
the
bell
began
to
toll,
instead
of
ringing
in
the
usual
way.
It
was
a
very
still
Sabbath,
and
the
mournful
sound
seemed
in
keeping
with
the
musing
hush
that
lay
upon
nature.
The
villagers
began
to
gather,
loitering
a
moment
in
the
vestibule
to
converse
in
whispers
about
the
sad
event.
But
there
was
no
whispering
in
the
house;
only
the
funereal
rustling
of
dresses
as
the
women
gathered
to
their
seats
disturbed
the
silence
there.
None
could
remember
when
the
little
church
had
been
so
full
before.
There
was
finally
a
waiting
pause,
an
expectant
dumbness,
and
then
Aunt
Polly
entered,
followed
by
Sid
and
Mary,
and
they
by
the
Harper
family,
all
in
deep
black,
and
the
whole
congregation,
the
old
minister
as
well,
rose
reverently
and
stood
until
the
mourners
were
seated
in
the
front
pew.
There
was
another
communing
silence,
broken
at
intervals
by
muffled
sobs,
and
then
the
minister
spread
his
hands
abroad
and
prayed.
A
moving
hymn
was
sung,
and
the
text
followed:
"I
am
the
Resurrection
and
the
Life."
As
the
service
proceeded,
the
clergyman
drew
such
pictures
of
the
graces,
the
winning
ways,
and
the
rare
promise
of
the
lost
lads
that
every
soul
there,
thinking
he
recognized
these
pictures,
felt
a
pang
in
remembering
that
he
had
persistently
blinded
himself
to
them
always
before,
and
had
as
persistently
seen
only
faults
and
flaws
in
the
poor
boys.
The
minister
related
many
a
touching
incident
in
the
lives
of
the
departed,
too,
which
illustrated
their
sweet,
generous
natures,
and
the
people
could
easily
see,
now,
how
noble
and
beautiful
those
episodes
were,
and
remembered
with
grief
that
at
the
time
they
occurred
they
had
seemed
rank
rascalities,
well
deserving
of
the
cowhide.
The
congregation
became
more
and
more
moved,
as
the
pathetic
tale
went
on,
till
at
last
the
whole
company
broke
down
and
joined
the
weeping
mourners
in
a
chorus
of
anguished
sobs,
the
preacher
himself
giving
way
to
his
feelings,
and
crying
in
the
pulpit.
There
was
a
rustle
in
the
gallery,
which
nobody
noticed;
a
moment
later
the
church
door
creaked;
the
minister
raised
his
streaming
eyes
above
his
handkerchief,
and
stood
transfixed!
First
one
and
then
another
pair
of
eyes
followed
the
minister's,
and
then
almost
with
one
impulse
the
congregation
rose
and
stared
while
the
three
dead
boys
came
marching
up
the
aisle,
Tom
in
the
lead,
Joe
next,
and
Huck,
a
ruin
of
drooping
rags,
sneaking
sheepishly
in
the
rear!
They
had
been
hid
in
the
unused
gallery
listening
to
their
own
funeral
sermon!
Aunt
Polly,
Mary,
and
the
Harpers
threw
themselves
upon
their
restored
ones,
smothered
them
with
kisses
and
poured
out
thanksgivings,
while
poor
Huck
stood
abashed
and
uncomfortable,
not
knowing
exactly
what
to
do
or
where
to
hide
from
so
many
unwelcoming
eyes.
He
wavered,
and
started
to
slink
away,
but
Tom
seized
him
and
said:
"Aunt
Polly,
it
ain't
fair.
Somebody's
got
to
be
glad
to
see
Huck."
"And
so
they
shall.
I'm
glad
to
see
him,
poor
motherless
thing!"
And
the
loving
attentions
Aunt
Polly
lavished
upon
him
were
the
one
thing
capable
of
making
him
more
uncomfortable
than
he
was
before.
Suddenly
the
minister
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice:
"Praise
God
from
whom
all
blessings
flow--SING!--and
put
your
hearts
in
it!"
And
they
did.
Old
Hundred
swelled
up
with
a
triumphant
burst,
and
while
it
shook
the
rafters
Tom
Sawyer
the
Pirate
looked
around
upon
the
envying
juveniles
about
him
and
confessed
in
his
heart
that
this
was
the
proudest
moment
of
his
life.
As
the
"sold"
congregation
trooped
out
they
said
they
would
almost
be
willing
to
be
made
ridiculous
again
to
hear
Old
Hundred
sung
like
that
once
more.
Tom
got
more
cuffs
and
kisses
that
day--according
to
Aunt
Polly's
varying
moods--than
he
had
earned
before
in
a
year;
and
he
hardly
knew
which
expressed
the
most
gratefulness
to
God
and
affection
for
himself.
CHAPTER
XVIII
THAT
was
Tom's
great
secret--the
scheme
to
return
home
with
his
brother
pirates
and
attend
their
own
funerals.
They
had
paddled
over
to
the
Missouri
shore
on
a
log,
at
dusk
on
Saturday,
landing
five
or
six
miles
below
the
village;
they
had
slept
in
the
woods
at
the
edge
of
the
town
till
nearly
daylight,
and
had
then
crept
through
back
lanes
and
alleys
and
finished
their
sleep
in
the
gallery
of
the
church
among
a
chaos
of
invalided
benches.
At
breakfast,
Monday
morning,
Aunt
Polly
and
Mary
were
very
loving
to
Tom,
and
very
attentive
to
his
wants.
There
was
an
unusual
amount
of
talk.
In
the
course
of
it
Aunt
Polly
said:
"Well,
I
don't
say
it
wasn't
a
fine
joke,
Tom,
to
keep
everybody
suffering
'most
a
week
so
you
boys
had
a
good
time,
but
it
is
a
pity
you
could
be
so
hard-hearted
as
to
let
me
suffer
so.
If
you
could
come
over
on
a
log
to
go
to
your
funeral,
you
could
have
come
over
and
give
me
a
hint
some
way
that
you
warn't
dead,
but
only
run
off."
"Yes,
you
could
have
done
that,
Tom,"
said
Mary;
"and
I
believe
you
would
if
you
had
thought
of
it."
"Would
you,
Tom?"
said
Aunt
Polly,
her
face
lighting
wistfully.
"Say,
now,
would
you,
if
you'd
thought
of
it?"
"I--well,
I
don't
know.
'Twould
'a'
spoiled
everything."
"Tom,
I
hoped
you
loved
me
that
much,"
said
Aunt
Polly,
with
a
grieved
tone
that
discomforted
the
boy.
"It
would
have
been
something
if
you'd
cared
enough
to
THINK
of
it,
even
if
you
didn't
DO
it."
"Now,
auntie,
that
ain't
any
harm,"
pleaded
Mary;
"it's
only
Tom's
giddy
way--he
is
always
in
such
a
rush
that
he
never
thinks
of
anything."
"More's
the
pity.
Sid
would
have
thought.
And
Sid
would
have
come
and
DONE
it,
too.
Tom,
you'll
look
back,
some
day,
when
it's
too
late,
and
wish
you'd
cared
a
little
more
for
me
when
it
would
have
cost
you
so
little."
"Now,
auntie,
you
know
I
do
care
for
you,"
said
Tom.
"I'd
know
it
better
if
you
acted
more
like
it."
"I
wish
now
I'd
thought,"
said
Tom,
with
a
repentant
tone;
"but
I
dreamt
about
you,
anyway.
That's
something,
ain't
it?"
"It
ain't
much--a
cat
does
that
much--but
it's
better
than
nothing.
What
did
you
dream?"
"Why,
Wednesday
night
I
dreamt
that
you
was
sitting
over
there
by
the
bed,
and
Sid
was
sitting
by
the
woodbox,
and
Mary
next
to
him."
"Well,
so
we
did.
So
we
always
do.
I'm
glad
your
dreams
could
take
even
that
much
trouble
about
us."
"And
I
dreamt
that
Joe
Harper's
mother
was
here."
"Why,
she
was
here!
Did
you
dream
any
more?"
"Oh,
lots.
But
it's
so
dim,
now."
"Well,
try
to
recollect--can't
you?"
"Somehow
it
seems
to
me
that
the
wind--the
wind
blowed
the--the--"
"Try
harder,
Tom!
The
wind
did
blow
something.
Come!"
Tom
pressed
his
fingers
on
his
forehead
an
anxious
minute,
and
then
said:
"I've
got
it
now!
I've
got
it
now!
It
blowed
the
candle!"
"Mercy
on
us!
Go
on,
Tom--go
on!"
"And
it
seems
to
me
that
you
said,
'Why,
I
believe
that
that
door--'"
"Go
ON,
Tom!"
"Just
let
me
study
a
moment--just
a
moment.
Oh,
yes--you
said
you
believed
the
door
was
open."
"As
I'm
sitting
here,
I
did!
Didn't
I,
Mary!
Go
on!"
"And
then--and
then--well
I
won't
be
certain,
but
it
seems
like
as
if
you
made
Sid
go
and--and--"
"Well?
Well?
What
did
I
make
him
do,
Tom?
What
did
I
make
him
do?"
"You
made
him--you--Oh,
you
made
him
shut
it."
"Well,
for
the
land's
sake!
I
never
heard
the
beat
of
that
in
all
my
days!
Don't
tell
ME
there
ain't
anything
in
dreams,
any
more.
Sereny
Harper
shall
know
of
this
before
I'm
an
hour
older.
I'd
like
to
see
her
get
around
THIS
with
her
rubbage
'bout
superstition.
Go
on,
Tom!"
"Oh,
it's
all
getting
just
as
bright
as
day,
now.
Next
you
said
I
warn't
BAD,
only
mischeevous
and
harum-scarum,
and
not
any
more
responsible
than--than--I
think
it
was
a
colt,
or
something."
"And
so
it
was!
Well,
goodness
gracious!
Go
on,
Tom!"
"And
then
you
began
to
cry."
"So
I
did.
So
I
did.
Not
the
first
time,
neither.
And
then--"
"Then
Mrs.
Harper
she
began
to
cry,
and
said
Joe
was
just
the
same,
and
she
wished
she
hadn't
whipped
him
for
taking
cream
when
she'd
throwed
it
out
her
own
self--"
"Tom!
The
sperrit
was
upon
you!
You
was
a
prophesying--that's
what
you
was
doing!
Land
alive,
go
on,
Tom!"
"Then
Sid
he
said--he
said--"
"I
don't
think
I
said
anything,"
said
Sid.
"Yes
you
did,
Sid,"
said
Mary.
"Shut
your
heads
and
let
Tom
go
on!
What
did
he
say,
Tom?"
"He
said--I
THINK
he
said
he
hoped
I
was
better
off
where
I
was
gone
to,
but
if
I'd
been
better
sometimes--"
"THERE,
d'you
hear
that!
It
was
his
very
words!"
"And
you
shut
him
up
sharp."
"I
lay
I
did!
There
must
'a'
been
an
angel
there.
There
WAS
an
angel
there,
somewheres!"
"And
Mrs.
Harper
told
about
Joe
scaring
her
with
a
firecracker,
and
you
told
about
Peter
and
the
Painkiller--"
"Just
as
true
as
I
live!"
"And
then
there
was
a
whole
lot
of
talk
'bout
dragging
the
river
for
us,
and
'bout
having
the
funeral
Sunday,
and
then
you
and
old
Miss
Harper
hugged
and
cried,
and
she
went."
"It
happened
just
so!
It
happened
just
so,
as
sure
as
I'm
a-sitting
in
these
very
tracks.
Tom,
you
couldn't
told
it
more
like
if
you'd
'a'
seen
it!
And
then
what?
Go
on,
Tom!"
"Then
I
thought
you
prayed
for
me--and
I
could
see
you
and
hear
every
word
you
said.
And
you
went
to
bed,
and
I
was
so
sorry
that
I
took
and
wrote
on
a
piece
of
sycamore
bark,
'We
ain't
dead--we
are
only
off
being
pirates,'
and
put
it
on
the
table
by
the
candle;
and
then
you
looked
so
good,
laying
there
asleep,
that
I
thought
I
went
and
leaned
over
and
kissed
you
on
the
lips."
"Did
you,
Tom,
DID
you!
I
just
forgive
you
everything
for
that!"
And
she
seized
the
boy
in
a
crushing
embrace
that
made
him
feel
like
the
guiltiest
of
villains.
"It
was
very
kind,
even
though
it
was
only
a--dream,"
Sid
soliloquized
just
audibly.
"Shut
up,
Sid!
A
body
does
just
the
same
in
a
dream
as
he'd
do
if
he
was
awake.
Here's
a
big
Milum
apple
I've
been
saving
for
you,
Tom,
if
you
was
ever
found
again--now
go
'long
to
school.
I'm
thankful
to
the
good
God
and
Father
of
us
all
I've
got
you
back,
that's
long-suffering
and
merciful
to
them
that
believe
on
Him
and
keep
His
word,
though
goodness
knows
I'm
unworthy
of
it,
but
if
only
the
worthy
ones
got
His
blessings
and
had
His
hand
to
help
them
over
the
rough
places,
there's
few
enough
would
smile
here
or
ever
enter
into
His
rest
when
the
long
night
comes.
Go
'long
Sid,
Mary,
Tom--take
yourselves
off--you've
hendered
me
long
enough."
The
children
left
for
school,
and
the
old
lady
to
call
on
Mrs.
Harper
and
vanquish
her
realism
with
Tom's
marvellous
dream.
Sid
had
better
judgment
than
to
utter
the
thought
that
was
in
his
mind
as
he
left
the
house.
It
was
this:
"Pretty
thin--as
long
a
dream
as
that,
without
any
mistakes
in
it!"
What
a
hero
Tom
was
become,
now!
He
did
not
go
skipping
and
prancing,
but
moved
with
a
dignified
swagger
as
became
a
pirate
who
felt
that
the
public
eye
was
on
him.
And
indeed
it
was;
he
tried
not
to
seem
to
see
the
looks
or
hear
the
remarks
as
he
passed
along,
but
they
were
food
and
drink
to
him.
Smaller
boys
than
himself
flocked
at
his
heels,
as
proud
to
be
seen
with
him,
and
tolerated
by
him,
as
if
he
had
been
the
drummer
at
the
head
of
a
procession
or
the
elephant
leading
a
menagerie
into
town.
Boys
of
his
own
size
pretended
not
to
know
he
had
been
away
at
all;
but
they
were
consuming
with
envy,
nevertheless.
They
would
have
given
anything
to
have
that
swarthy
suntanned
skin
of
his,
and
his
glittering
notoriety;
and
Tom
would
not
have
parted
with
either
for
a
circus.
At
school
the
children
made
so
much
of
him
and
of
Joe,
and
delivered
such
eloquent
admiration
from
their
eyes,
that
the
two
heroes
were
not
long
in
becoming
insufferably
"stuck-up."
They
began
to
tell
their
adventures
to
hungry
listeners--but
they
only
began;
it
was
not
a
thing
likely
to
have
an
end,
with
imaginations
like
theirs
to
furnish
material.
And
finally,
when
they
got
out
their
pipes
and
went
serenely
puffing
around,
the
very
summit
of
glory
was
reached.
Tom
decided
that
he
could
be
independent
of
Becky
Thatcher
now.
Glory
was
sufficient.
He
would
live
for
glory.
Now
that
he
was
distinguished,
maybe
she
would
be
wanting
to
"make
up."
Well,
let
her--she
should
see
that
he
could
be
as
indifferent
as
some
other
people.
Presently
she
arrived.
Tom
pretended
not
to
see
her.
He
moved
away
and
joined
a
group
of
boys
and
girls
and
began
to
talk.
Soon
he
observed
that
she
was
tripping
gayly
back
and
forth
with
flushed
face
and
dancing
eyes,
pretending
to
be
busy
chasing
schoolmates,
and
screaming
with
laughter
when
she
made
a
capture;
but
he
noticed
that
she
always
made
her
captures
in
his
vicinity,
and
that
she
seemed
to
cast
a
conscious
eye
in
his
direction
at
such
times,
too.
It
gratified
all
the
vicious
vanity
that
was
in
him;
and
so,
instead
of
winning
him,
it
only
"set
him
up"
the
more
and
made
him
the
more
diligent
to
avoid
betraying
that
he
knew
she
was
about.
Presently
she
gave
over
skylarking,
and
moved
irresolutely
about,
sighing
once
or
twice
and
glancing
furtively
and
wistfully
toward
Tom.
Then
she
observed
that
now
Tom
was
talking
more
particularly
to
Amy
Lawrence
than
to
any
one
else.
She
felt
a
sharp
pang
and
grew
disturbed
and
uneasy
at
once.
She
tried
to
go
away,
but
her
feet
were
treacherous,
and
carried
her
to
the
group
instead.
She
said
to
a
girl
almost
at
Tom's
elbow--with
sham
vivacity:
"Why,
Mary
Austin!
you
bad
girl,
why
didn't
you
come
to
Sunday-school?"
"I
did
come--didn't
you
see
me?"
"Why,
no!
Did
you?
Where
did
you
sit?"
"I
was
in
Miss
Peters'
class,
where
I
always
go.
I
saw
YOU."
"Did
you?
Why,
it's
funny
I
didn't
see
you.
I
wanted
to
tell
you
about
the
picnic."
"Oh,
that's
jolly.
Who's
going
to
give
it?"
"My
ma's
going
to
let
me
have
one."
"Oh,
goody;
I
hope
she'll
let
ME
come."
"Well,
she
will.
The
picnic's
for
me.
She'll
let
anybody
come
that
I
want,
and
I
want
you."
"That's
ever
so
nice.
When
is
it
going
to
be?"
"By
and
by.
Maybe
about
vacation."
"Oh,
won't
it
be
fun!
You
going
to
have
all
the
girls
and
boys?"
"Yes,
every
one
that's
friends
to
me--or
wants
to
be";
and
she
glanced
ever
so
furtively
at
Tom,
but
he
talked
right
along
to
Amy
Lawrence
about
the
terrible
storm
on
the
island,
and
how
the
lightning
tore
the
great
sycamore
tree
"all
to
flinders"
while
he
was
"standing
within
three
feet
of
it."
"Oh,
may
I
come?"
said
Grace
Miller.
"Yes."
"And
me?"
said
Sally
Rogers.
"Yes."
"And
me,
too?"
said
Susy
Harper.
"And
Joe?"
"Yes."
And
so
on,
with
clapping
of
joyful
hands
till
all
the
group
had
begged
for
invitations
but
Tom
and
Amy.
Then
Tom
turned
coolly
away,
still
talking,
and
took
Amy
with
him.
Becky's
lips
trembled
and
the
tears
came
to
her
eyes;
she
hid
these
signs
with
a
forced
gayety
and
went
on
chattering,
but
the
life
had
gone
out
of
the
picnic,
now,
and
out
of
everything
else;
she
got
away
as
soon
as
she
could
and
hid
herself
and
had
what
her
sex
call
"a
good
cry."
Then
she
sat
moody,
with
wounded
pride,
till
the
bell
rang.
She
roused
up,
now,
with
a
vindictive
cast
in
her
eye,
and
gave
her
plaited
tails
a
shake
and
said
she
knew
what
SHE'D
do.
At
recess
Tom
continued
his
flirtation
with
Amy
with
jubilant
self-satisfaction.
And
he
kept
drifting
about
to
find
Becky
and
lacerate
her
with
the
performance.
At
last
he
spied
her,
but
there
was
a
sudden
falling
of
his
mercury.
She
was
sitting
cosily
on
a
little
bench
behind
the
schoolhouse
looking
at
a
picture-book
with
Alfred
Temple--and
so
absorbed
were
they,
and
their
heads
so
close
together
over
the
book,
that
they
did
not
seem
to
be
conscious
of
anything
in
the
world
besides.
Jealousy
ran
red-hot
through
Tom's
veins.
He
began
to
hate
himself
for
throwing
away
the
chance
Becky
had
offered
for
a
reconciliation.
He
called
himself
a
fool,
and
all
the
hard
names
he
could
think
of.
He
wanted
to
cry
with
vexation.
Amy
chatted
happily
along,
as
they
walked,
for
her
heart
was
singing,
but
Tom's
tongue
had
lost
its
function.
He
did
not
hear
what
Amy
was
saying,
and
whenever
she
paused
expectantly
he
could
only
stammer
an
awkward
assent,
which
was
as
often
misplaced
as
otherwise.
He
kept
drifting
to
the
rear
of
the
schoolhouse,
again
and
again,
to
sear
his
eyeballs
with
the
hateful
spectacle
there.
He
could
not
help
it.
And
it
maddened
him
to
see,
as
he
thought
he
saw,
that
Becky
Thatcher
never
once
suspected
that
he
was
even
in
the
land
of
the
living.
But
she
did
see,
nevertheless;
and
she
knew
she
was
winning
her
fight,
too,
and
was
glad
to
see
him
suffer
as
she
had
suffered.
Amy's
happy
prattle
became
intolerable.
Tom
hinted
at
things
he
had
to
attend
to;
things
that
must
be
done;
and
time
was
fleeting.
But
in
vain--the
girl
chirped
on.
Tom
thought,
"Oh,
hang
her,
ain't
I
ever
going
to
get
rid
of
her?"
At
last
he
must
be
attending
to
those
things--and
she
said
artlessly
that
she
would
be
"around"
when
school
let
out.
And
he
hastened
away,
hating
her
for
it.
"Any
other
boy!"
Tom
thought,
grating
his
teeth.
"Any
boy
in
the
whole
town
but
that
Saint
Louis
smarty
that
thinks
he
dresses
so
fine
and
is
aristocracy!
Oh,
all
right,
I
licked
you
the
first
day
you
ever
saw
this
town,
mister,
and
I'll
lick
you
again!
You
just
wait
till
I
catch
you
out!
I'll
just
take
and--"
And
he
went
through
the
motions
of
thrashing
an
imaginary
boy
--pummelling
the
air,
and
kicking
and
gouging.
"Oh,
you
do,
do
you?
You
holler
'nough,
do
you?
Now,
then,
let
that
learn
you!"
And
so
the
imaginary
flogging
was
finished
to
his
satisfaction.
Tom
fled
home
at
noon.
His
conscience
could
not
endure
any
more
of
Amy's
grateful
happiness,
and
his
jealousy
could
bear
no
more
of
the
other
distress.
Becky
resumed
her
picture
inspections
with
Alfred,
but
as
the
minutes
dragged
along
and
no
Tom
came
to
suffer,
her
triumph
began
to
cloud
and
she
lost
interest;
gravity
and
absent-mindedness
followed,
and
then
melancholy;
two
or
three
times
she
pricked
up
her
ear
at
a
footstep,
but
it
was
a
false
hope;
no
Tom
came.
At
last
she
grew
entirely
miserable
and
wished
she
hadn't
carried
it
so
far.
When
poor
Alfred,
seeing
that
he
was
losing
her,
he
did
not
know
how,
kept
exclaiming:
"Oh,
here's
a
jolly
one!
look
at
this!"
she
lost
patience
at
last,
and
said,
"Oh,
don't
bother
me!
I
don't
care
for
them!"
and
burst
into
tears,
and
got
up
and
walked
away.
Alfred
dropped
alongside
and
was
going
to
try
to
comfort
her,
but
she
said:
"Go
away
and
leave
me
alone,
can't
you!
I
hate
you!"
So
the
boy
halted,
wondering
what
he
could
have
done--for
she
had
said
she
would
look
at
pictures
all
through
the
nooning--and
she
walked
on,
crying.
Then
Alfred
went
musing
into
the
deserted
schoolhouse.
He
was
humiliated
and
angry.
He
easily
guessed
his
way
to
the
truth--the
girl
had
simply
made
a
convenience
of
him
to
vent
her
spite
upon
Tom
Sawyer.
He
was
far
from
hating
Tom
the
less
when
this
thought
occurred
to
him.
He
wished
there
was
some
way
to
get
that
boy
into
trouble
without
much
risk
to
himself.
Tom's
spelling-book
fell
under
his
eye.
Here
was
his
opportunity.
He
gratefully
opened
to
the
lesson
for
the
afternoon
and
poured
ink
upon
the
page.
Becky,
glancing
in
at
a
window
behind
him
at
the
moment,
saw
the
act,
and
moved
on,
without
discovering
herself.
She
started
homeward,
now,
intending
to
find
Tom
and
tell
him;
Tom
would
be
thankful
and
their
troubles
would
be
healed.
Before
she
was
half
way
home,
however,
she
had
changed
her
mind.
The
thought
of
Tom's
treatment
of
her
when
she
was
talking
about
her
picnic
came
scorching
back
and
filled
her
with
shame.
She
resolved
to
let
him
get
whipped
on
the
damaged
spelling-book's
account,
and
to
hate
him
forever,
into
the
bargain.
CHAPTER
XIX
TOM
arrived
at
home
in
a
dreary
mood,
and
the
first
thing
his
aunt
said
to
him
showed
him
that
he
had
brought
his
sorrows
to
an
unpromising
market:
"Tom,
I've
a
notion
to
skin
you
alive!"
"Auntie,
what
have
I
done?"
"Well,
you've
done
enough.
Here
I
go
over
to
Sereny
Harper,
like
an
old
softy,
expecting
I'm
going
to
make
her
believe
all
that
rubbage
about
that
dream,
when
lo
and
behold
you
she'd
found
out
from
Joe
that
you
was
over
here
and
heard
all
the
talk
we
had
that
night.
Tom,
I
don't
know
what
is
to
become
of
a
boy
that
will
act
like
that.
It
makes
me
feel
so
bad
to
think
you
could
let
me
go
to
Sereny
Harper
and
make
such
a
fool
of
myself
and
never
say
a
word."
This
was
a
new
aspect
of
the
thing.
His
smartness
of
the
morning
had
seemed
to
Tom
a
good
joke
before,
and
very
ingenious.
It
merely
looked
mean
and
shabby
now.
He
hung
his
head
and
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
for
a
moment.
Then
he
said:
"Auntie,
I
wish
I
hadn't
done
it--but
I
didn't
think."
"Oh,
child,
you
never
think.
You
never
think
of
anything
but
your
own
selfishness.
You
could
think
to
come
all
the
way
over
here
from
Jackson's
Island
in
the
night
to
laugh
at
our
troubles,
and
you
could
think
to
fool
me
with
a
lie
about
a
dream;
but
you
couldn't
ever
think
to
pity
us
and
save
us
from
sorrow."
"Auntie,
I
know
now
it
was
mean,
but
I
didn't
mean
to
be
mean.
I
didn't,
honest.
And
besides,
I
didn't
come
over
here
to
laugh
at
you
that
night."
"What
did
you
come
for,
then?"
"It
was
to
tell
you
not
to
be
uneasy
about
us,
because
we
hadn't
got
drownded."
"Tom,
Tom,
I
would
be
the
thankfullest
soul
in
this
world
if
I
could
believe
you
ever
had
as
good
a
thought
as
that,
but
you
know
you
never
did--and
I
know
it,
Tom."
"Indeed
and
'deed
I
did,
auntie--I
wish
I
may
never
stir
if
I
didn't."
"Oh,
Tom,
don't
lie--don't
do
it.
It
only
makes
things
a
hundred
times
worse."
"It
ain't
a
lie,
auntie;
it's
the
truth.
I
wanted
to
keep
you
from
grieving--that
was
all
that
made
me
come."
"I'd
give
the
whole
world
to
believe
that--it
would
cover
up
a
power
of
sins,
Tom.
I'd
'most
be
glad
you'd
run
off
and
acted
so
bad.
But
it
ain't
reasonable;
because,
why
didn't
you
tell
me,
child?"
"Why,
you
see,
when
you
got
to
talking
about
the
funeral,
I
just
got
all
full
of
the
idea
of
our
coming
and
hiding
in
the
church,
and
I
couldn't
somehow
bear
to
spoil
it.
So
I
just
put
the
bark
back
in
my
pocket
and
kept
mum."
"What
bark?"
"The
bark
I
had
wrote
on
to
tell
you
we'd
gone
pirating.
I
wish,
now,
you'd
waked
up
when
I
kissed
you--I
do,
honest."
The
hard
lines
in
his
aunt's
face
relaxed
and
a
sudden
tenderness
dawned
in
her
eyes.
"DID
you
kiss
me,
Tom?"
"Why,
yes,
I
did."
"Are
you
sure
you
did,
Tom?"
"Why,
yes,
I
did,
auntie--certain
sure."
"What
did
you
kiss
me
for,
Tom?"
"Because
I
loved
you
so,
and
you
laid
there
moaning
and
I
was
so
sorry."
The
words
sounded
like
truth.
The
old
lady
could
not
hide
a
tremor
in
her
voice
when
she
said:
"Kiss
me
again,
Tom!--and
be
off
with
you
to
school,
now,
and
don't
bother
me
any
more."
The
moment
he
was
gone,
she
ran
to
a
closet
and
got
out
the
ruin
of
a
jacket
which
Tom
had
gone
pirating
in.
Then
she
stopped,
with
it
in
her
hand,
and
said
to
herself:
"No,
I
don't
dare.
Poor
boy,
I
reckon
he's
lied
about
it--but
it's
a
blessed,
blessed
lie,
there's
such
a
comfort
come
from
it.
I
hope
the
Lord--I
KNOW
the
Lord
will
forgive
him,
because
it
was
such
goodheartedness
in
him
to
tell
it.
But
I
don't
want
to
find
out
it's
a
lie.
I
won't
look."
She
put
the
jacket
away,
and
stood
by
musing
a
minute.
Twice
she
put
out
her
hand
to
take
the
garment
again,
and
twice
she
refrained.
Once
more
she
ventured,
and
this
time
she
fortified
herself
with
the
thought:
"It's
a
good
lie--it's
a
good
lie--I
won't
let
it
grieve
me."
So
she
sought
the
jacket
pocket.
A
moment
later
she
was
reading
Tom's
piece
of
bark
through
flowing
tears
and
saying:
"I
could
forgive
the
boy,
now,
if
he'd
committed
a
million
sins!"
CHAPTER
XX
THERE
was
something
about
Aunt
Polly's
manner,
when
she
kissed
Tom,
that
swept
away
his
low
spirits
and
made
him
lighthearted
and
happy
again.
He
started
to
school
and
had
the
luck
of
coming
upon
Becky
Thatcher
at
the
head
of
Meadow
Lane.
His
mood
always
determined
his
manner.
Without
a
moment's
hesitation
he
ran
to
her
and
said:
"I
acted
mighty
mean
to-day,
Becky,
and
I'm
so
sorry.
I
won't
ever,
ever
do
that
way
again,
as
long
as
ever
I
live--please
make
up,
won't
you?"
The
girl
stopped
and
looked
him
scornfully
in
the
face:
"I'll
thank
you
to
keep
yourself
TO
yourself,
Mr.
Thomas
Sawyer.
I'll
never
speak
to
you
again."
She
tossed
her
head
and
passed
on.
Tom
was
so
stunned
that
he
had
not
even
presence
of
mind
enough
to
say
"Who
cares,
Miss
Smarty?"
until
the
right
time
to
say
it
had
gone
by.
So
he
said
nothing.
But
he
was
in
a
fine
rage,
nevertheless.
He
moped
into
the
schoolyard
wishing
she
were
a
boy,
and
imagining
how
he
would
trounce
her
if
she
were.
He
presently
encountered
her
and
delivered
a
stinging
remark
as
he
passed.
She
hurled
one
in
return,
and
the
angry
breach
was
complete.
It
seemed
to
Becky,
in
her
hot
resentment,
that
she
could
hardly
wait
for
school
to
"take
in,"
she
was
so
impatient
to
see
Tom
flogged
for
the
injured
spelling-book.
If
she
had
had
any
lingering
notion
of
exposing
Alfred
Temple,
Tom's
offensive
fling
had
driven
it
entirely
away.
Poor
girl,
she
did
not
know
how
fast
she
was
nearing
trouble
herself.
The
master,
Mr.
Dobbins,
had
reached
middle
age
with
an
unsatisfied
ambition.
The
darling
of
his
desires
was,
to
be
a
doctor,
but
poverty
had
decreed
that
he
should
be
nothing
higher
than
a
village
schoolmaster.
Every
day
he
took
a
mysterious
book
out
of
his
desk
and
absorbed
himself
in
it
at
times
when
no
classes
were
reciting.
He
kept
that
book
under
lock
and
key.
There
was
not
an
urchin
in
school
but
was
perishing
to
have
a
glimpse
of
it,
but
the
chance
never
came.
Every
boy
and
girl
had
a
theory
about
the
nature
of
that
book;
but
no
two
theories
were
alike,
and
there
was
no
way
of
getting
at
the
facts
in
the
case.
Now,
as
Becky
was
passing
by
the
desk,
which
stood
near
the
door,
she
noticed
that
the
key
was
in
the
lock!
It
was
a
precious
moment.
She
glanced
around;
found
herself
alone,
and
the
next
instant
she
had
the
book
in
her
hands.
The
title-page--Professor
Somebody's
ANATOMY--carried
no
information
to
her
mind;
so
she
began
to
turn
the
leaves.
She
came
at
once
upon
a
handsomely
engraved
and
colored
frontispiece--a
human
figure,
stark
naked.
At
that
moment
a
shadow
fell
on
the
page
and
Tom
Sawyer
stepped
in
at
the
door
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
picture.
Becky
snatched
at
the
book
to
close
it,
and
had
the
hard
luck
to
tear
the
pictured
page
half
down
the
middle.
She
thrust
the
volume
into
the
desk,
turned
the
key,
and
burst
out
crying
with
shame
and
vexation.
"Tom
Sawyer,
you
are
just
as
mean
as
you
can
be,
to
sneak
up
on
a
person
and
look
at
what
they're
looking
at."
"How
could
I
know
you
was
looking
at
anything?"
"You
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself,
Tom
Sawyer;
you
know
you're
going
to
tell
on
me,
and
oh,
what
shall
I
do,
what
shall
I
do!
I'll
be
whipped,
and
I
never
was
whipped
in
school."
Then
she
stamped
her
little
foot
and
said:
"BE
so
mean
if
you
want
to!
I
know
something
that's
going
to
happen.
You
just
wait
and
you'll
see!
Hateful,
hateful,
hateful!"--and
she
flung
out
of
the
house
with
a
new
explosion
of
crying.
Tom
stood
still,
rather
flustered
by
this
onslaught.
Presently
he
said
to
himself:
"What
a
curious
kind
of
a
fool
a
girl
is!
Never
been
licked
in
school!
Shucks!
What's
a
licking!
That's
just
like
a
girl--they're
so
thin-skinned
and
chicken-hearted.
Well,
of
course
I
ain't
going
to
tell
old
Dobbins
on
this
little
fool,
because
there's
other
ways
of
getting
even
on
her,
that
ain't
so
mean;
but
what
of
it?
Old
Dobbins
will
ask
who
it
was
tore
his
book.
Nobody'll
answer.
Then
he'll
do
just
the
way
he
always
does--ask
first
one
and
then
t'other,
and
when
he
comes
to
the
right
girl
he'll
know
it,
without
any
telling.
Girls'
faces
always
tell
on
them.
They
ain't
got
any
backbone.
She'll
get
licked.
Well,
it's
a
kind
of
a
tight
place
for
Becky
Thatcher,
because
there
ain't
any
way
out
of
it."
Tom
conned
the
thing
a
moment
longer,
and
then
added:
"All
right,
though;
she'd
like
to
see
me
in
just
such
a
fix--let
her
sweat
it
out!"
Tom
joined
the
mob
of
skylarking
scholars
outside.
In
a
few
moments
the
master
arrived
and
school
"took
in."
Tom
did
not
feel
a
strong
interest
in
his
studies.
Every
time
he
stole
a
glance
at
the
girls'
side
of
the
room
Becky's
face
troubled
him.
Considering
all
things,
he
did
not
want
to
pity
her,
and
yet
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
help
it.
He
could
get
up
no
exultation
that
was
really
worthy
the
name.
Presently
the
spelling-book
discovery
was
made,
and
Tom's
mind
was
entirely
full
of
his
own
matters
for
a
while
after
that.
Becky
roused
up
from
her
lethargy
of
distress
and
showed
good
interest
in
the
proceedings.
She
did
not
expect
that
Tom
could
get
out
of
his
trouble
by
denying
that
he
spilt
the
ink
on
the
book
himself;
and
she
was
right.
The
denial
only
seemed
to
make
the
thing
worse
for
Tom.
Becky
supposed
she
would
be
glad
of
that,
and
she
tried
to
believe
she
was
glad
of
it,
but
she
found
she
was
not
certain.
When
the
worst
came
to
the
worst,
she
had
an
impulse
to
get
up
and
tell
on
Alfred
Temple,
but
she
made
an
effort
and
forced
herself
to
keep
still--because,
said
she
to
herself,
"he'll
tell
about
me
tearing
the
picture
sure.
I
wouldn't
say
a
word,
not
to
save
his
life!"
Tom
took
his
whipping
and
went
back
to
his
seat
not
at
all
broken-hearted,
for
he
thought
it
was
possible
that
he
had
unknowingly
upset
the
ink
on
the
spelling-book
himself,
in
some
skylarking
bout--he
had
denied
it
for
form's
sake
and
because
it
was
custom,
and
had
stuck
to
the
denial
from
principle.
A
whole
hour
drifted
by,
the
master
sat
nodding
in
his
throne,
the
air
was
drowsy
with
the
hum
of
study.
By
and
by,
Mr.
Dobbins
straightened
himself
up,
yawned,
then
unlocked
his
desk,
and
reached
for
his
book,
but
seemed
undecided
whether
to
take
it
out
or
leave
it.
Most
of
the
pupils
glanced
up
languidly,
but
there
were
two
among
them
that
watched
his
movements
with
intent
eyes.
Mr.
Dobbins
fingered
his
book
absently
for
a
while,
then
took
it
out
and
settled
himself
in
his
chair
to
read!
Tom
shot
a
glance
at
Becky.
He
had
seen
a
hunted
and
helpless
rabbit
look
as
she
did,
with
a
gun
levelled
at
its
head.
Instantly
he
forgot
his
quarrel
with
her.
Quick--something
must
be
done!
done
in
a
flash,
too!
But
the
very
imminence
of
the
emergency
paralyzed
his
invention.
Good!--he
had
an
inspiration!
He
would
run
and
snatch
the
book,
spring
through
the
door
and
fly.
But
his
resolution
shook
for
one
little
instant,
and
the
chance
was
lost--the
master
opened
the
volume.
If
Tom
only
had
the
wasted
opportunity
back
again!
Too
late.
There
was
no
help
for
Becky
now,
he
said.
The
next
moment
the
master
faced
the
school.
Every
eye
sank
under
his
gaze.
There
was
that
in
it
which
smote
even
the
innocent
with
fear.
There
was
silence
while
one
might
count
ten
--the
master
was
gathering
his
wrath.
Then
he
spoke:
"Who
tore
this
book?"
There
was
not
a
sound.
One
could
have
heard
a
pin
drop.
The
stillness
continued;
the
master
searched
face
after
face
for
signs
of
guilt.
"Benjamin
Rogers,
did
you
tear
this
book?"
A
denial.
Another
pause.
"Joseph
Harper,
did
you?"
Another
denial.
Tom's
uneasiness
grew
more
and
more
intense
under
the
slow
torture
of
these
proceedings.
The
master
scanned
the
ranks
of
boys--considered
a
while,
then
turned
to
the
girls:
"Amy
Lawrence?"
A
shake
of
the
head.
"Gracie
Miller?"
The
same
sign.
"Susan
Harper,
did
you
do
this?"
Another
negative.
The
next
girl
was
Becky
Thatcher.
Tom
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
with
excitement
and
a
sense
of
the
hopelessness
of
the
situation.
"Rebecca
Thatcher"
[Tom
glanced
at
her
face--it
was
white
with
terror]
--"did
you
tear--no,
look
me
in
the
face"
[her
hands
rose
in
appeal]
--"did
you
tear
this
book?"
A
thought
shot
like
lightning
through
Tom's
brain.
He
sprang
to
his
feet
and
shouted--"I
done
it!"
The
school
stared
in
perplexity
at
this
incredible
folly.
Tom
stood
a
moment,
to
gather
his
dismembered
faculties;
and
when
he
stepped
forward
to
go
to
his
punishment
the
surprise,
the
gratitude,
the
adoration
that
shone
upon
him
out
of
poor
Becky's
eyes
seemed
pay
enough
for
a
hundred
floggings.
Inspired
by
the
splendor
of
his
own
act,
he
took
without
an
outcry
the
most
merciless
flaying
that
even
Mr.
Dobbins
had
ever
administered;
and
also
received
with
indifference
the
added
cruelty
of
a
command
to
remain
two
hours
after
school
should
be
dismissed--for
he
knew
who
would
wait
for
him
outside
till
his
captivity
was
done,
and
not
count
the
tedious
time
as
loss,
either.
Tom
went
to
bed
that
night
planning
vengeance
against
Alfred
Temple;
for
with
shame
and
repentance
Becky
had
told
him
all,
not
forgetting
her
own
treachery;
but
even
the
longing
for
vengeance
had
to
give
way,
soon,
to
pleasanter
musings,
and
he
fell
asleep
at
last
with
Becky's
latest
words
lingering
dreamily
in
his
ear--
"Tom,
how
COULD
you
be
so
noble!"
CHAPTER
XXI
VACATION
was
approaching.
The
schoolmaster,
always
severe,
grew
severer
and
more
exacting
than
ever,
for
he
wanted
the
school
to
make
a
good
showing
on
"Examination"
day.
His
rod
and
his
ferule
were
seldom
idle
now--at
least
among
the
smaller
pupils.
Only
the
biggest
boys,
and
young
ladies
of
eighteen
and
twenty,
escaped
lashing.
Mr.
Dobbins'
lashings
were
very
vigorous
ones,
too;
for
although
he
carried,
under
his
wig,
a
perfectly
bald
and
shiny
head,
he
had
only
reached
middle
age,
and
there
was
no
sign
of
feebleness
in
his
muscle.
As
the
great
day
approached,
all
the
tyranny
that
was
in
him
came
to
the
surface;
he
seemed
to
take
a
vindictive
pleasure
in
punishing
the
least
shortcomings.
The
consequence
was,
that
the
smaller
boys
spent
their
days
in
terror
and
suffering
and
their
nights
in
plotting
revenge.
They
threw
away
no
opportunity
to
do
the
master
a
mischief.
But
he
kept
ahead
all
the
time.
The
retribution
that
followed
every
vengeful
success
was
so
sweeping
and
majestic
that
the
boys
always
retired
from
the
field
badly
worsted.
At
last
they
conspired
together
and
hit
upon
a
plan
that
promised
a
dazzling
victory.
They
swore
in
the
sign-painter's
boy,
told
him
the
scheme,
and
asked
his
help.
He
had
his
own
reasons
for
being
delighted,
for
the
master
boarded
in
his
father's
family
and
had
given
the
boy
ample
cause
to
hate
him.
The
master's
wife
would
go
on
a
visit
to
the
country
in
a
few
days,
and
there
would
be
nothing
to
interfere
with
the
plan;
the
master
always
prepared
himself
for
great
occasions
by
getting
pretty
well
fuddled,
and
the
sign-painter's
boy
said
that
when
the
dominie
had
reached
the
proper
condition
on
Examination
Evening
he
would
"manage
the
thing"
while
he
napped
in
his
chair;
then
he
would
have
him
awakened
at
the
right
time
and
hurried
away
to
school.
In
the
fulness
of
time
the
interesting
occasion
arrived.
At
eight
in
the
evening
the
schoolhouse
was
brilliantly
lighted,
and
adorned
with
wreaths
and
festoons
of
foliage
and
flowers.
The
master
sat
throned
in
his
great
chair
upon
a
raised
platform,
with
his
blackboard
behind
him.
He
was
looking
tolerably
mellow.
Three
rows
of
benches
on
each
side
and
six
rows
in
front
of
him
were
occupied
by
the
dignitaries
of
the
town
and
by
the
parents
of
the
pupils.
To
his
left,
back
of
the
rows
of
citizens,
was
a
spacious
temporary
platform
upon
which
were
seated
the
scholars
who
were
to
take
part
in
the
exercises
of
the
evening;
rows
of
small
boys,
washed
and
dressed
to
an
intolerable
state
of
discomfort;
rows
of
gawky
big
boys;
snowbanks
of
girls
and
young
ladies
clad
in
lawn
and
muslin
and
conspicuously
conscious
of
their
bare
arms,
their
grandmothers'
ancient
trinkets,
their
bits
of
pink
and
blue
ribbon
and
the
flowers
in
their
hair.
All
the
rest
of
the
house
was
filled
with
non-participating
scholars.
The
exercises
began.
A
very
little
boy
stood
up
and
sheepishly
recited,
"You'd
scarce
expect
one
of
my
age
to
speak
in
public
on
the
stage,"
etc.--accompanying
himself
with
the
painfully
exact
and
spasmodic
gestures
which
a
machine
might
have
used--supposing
the
machine
to
be
a
trifle
out
of
order.
But
he
got
through
safely,
though
cruelly
scared,
and
got
a
fine
round
of
applause
when
he
made
his
manufactured
bow
and
retired.
A
little
shamefaced
girl
lisped,
"Mary
had
a
little
lamb,"
etc.,
performed
a
compassion-inspiring
curtsy,
got
her
meed
of
applause,
and
sat
down
flushed
and
happy.
Tom
Sawyer
stepped
forward
with
conceited
confidence
and
soared
into
the
unquenchable
and
indestructible
"Give
me
liberty
or
give
me
death"
speech,
with
fine
fury
and
frantic
gesticulation,
and
broke
down
in
the
middle
of
it.
A
ghastly
stage-fright
seized
him,
his
legs
quaked
under
him
and
he
was
like
to
choke.
True,
he
had
the
manifest
sympathy
of
the
house
but
he
had
the
house's
silence,
too,
which
was
even
worse
than
its
sympathy.
The
master
frowned,
and
this
completed
the
disaster.
Tom
struggled
awhile
and
then
retired,
utterly
defeated.
There
was
a
weak
attempt
at
applause,
but
it
died
early.
"The
Boy
Stood
on
the
Burning
Deck"
followed;
also
"The
Assyrian
Came
Down,"
and
other
declamatory
gems.
Then
there
were
reading
exercises,
and
a
spelling
fight.
The
meagre
Latin
class
recited
with
honor.
The
prime
feature
of
the
evening
was
in
order,
now--original
"compositions"
by
the
young
ladies.
Each
in
her
turn
stepped
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
platform,
cleared
her
throat,
held
up
her
manuscript
(tied
with
dainty
ribbon),
and
proceeded
to
read,
with
labored
attention
to
"expression"
and
punctuation.
The
themes
were
the
same
that
had
been
illuminated
upon
similar
occasions
by
their
mothers
before
them,
their
grandmothers,
and
doubtless
all
their
ancestors
in
the
female
line
clear
back
to
the
Crusades.
"Friendship"
was
one;
"Memories
of
Other
Days";
"Religion
in
History";
"Dream
Land";
"The
Advantages
of
Culture";
"Forms
of
Political
Government
Compared
and
Contrasted";
"Melancholy";
"Filial
Love";
"Heart
Longings,"
etc.,
etc.
A
prevalent
feature
in
these
compositions
was
a
nursed
and
petted
melancholy;
another
was
a
wasteful
and
opulent
gush
of
"fine
language";
another
was
a
tendency
to
lug
in
by
the
ears
particularly
prized
words
and
phrases
until
they
were
worn
entirely
out;
and
a
peculiarity
that
conspicuously
marked
and
marred
them
was
the
inveterate
and
intolerable
sermon
that
wagged
its
crippled
tail
at
the
end
of
each
and
every
one
of
them.
No
matter
what
the
subject
might
be,
a
brain-racking
effort
was
made
to
squirm
it
into
some
aspect
or
other
that
the
moral
and
religious
mind
could
contemplate
with
edification.
The
glaring
insincerity
of
these
sermons
was
not
sufficient
to
compass
the
banishment
of
the
fashion
from
the
schools,
and
it
is
not
sufficient
to-day;
it
never
will
be
sufficient
while
the
world
stands,
perhaps.
There
is
no
school
in
all
our
land
where
the
young
ladies
do
not
feel
obliged
to
close
their
compositions
with
a
sermon;
and
you
will
find
that
the
sermon
of
the
most
frivolous
and
the
least
religious
girl
in
the
school
is
always
the
longest
and
the
most
relentlessly
pious.
But
enough
of
this.
Homely
truth
is
unpalatable.
Let
us
return
to
the
"Examination."
The
first
composition
that
was
read
was
one
entitled
"Is
this,
then,
Life?"
Perhaps
the
reader
can
endure
an
extract
from
it:
"In
the
common
walks
of
life,
with
what
delightful
emotions
does
the
youthful
mind
look
forward
to
some
anticipated
scene
of
festivity!
Imagination
is
busy
sketching
rose-tinted
pictures
of
joy.
In
fancy,
the
voluptuous
votary
of
fashion
sees
herself
amid
the
festive
throng,
'the
observed
of
all
observers.'
Her
graceful
form,
arrayed
in
snowy
robes,
is
whirling
through
the
mazes
of
the
joyous
dance;
her
eye
is
brightest,
her
step
is
lightest
in
the
gay
assembly.
"In
such
delicious
fancies
time
quickly
glides
by,
and
the
welcome
hour
arrives
for
her
entrance
into
the
Elysian
world,
of
which
she
has
had
such
bright
dreams.
How
fairy-like
does
everything
appear
to
her
enchanted
vision!
Each
new
scene
is
more
charming
than
the
last.
But
after
a
while
she
finds
that
beneath
this
goodly
exterior,
all
is
vanity,
the
flattery
which
once
charmed
her
soul,
now
grates
harshly
upon
her
ear;
the
ball-room
has
lost
its
charms;
and
with
wasted
health
and
imbittered
heart,
she
turns
away
with
the
conviction
that
earthly
pleasures
cannot
satisfy
the
longings
of
the
soul!"
And
so
forth
and
so
on.
There
was
a
buzz
of
gratification
from
time
to
time
during
the
reading,
accompanied
by
whispered
ejaculations
of
"How
sweet!"
"How
eloquent!"
"So
true!"
etc.,
and
after
the
thing
had
closed
with
a
peculiarly
afflicting
sermon
the
applause
was
enthusiastic.
Then
arose
a
slim,
melancholy
girl,
whose
face
had
the
"interesting"
paleness
that
comes
of
pills
and
indigestion,
and
read
a
"poem."
Two
stanzas
of
it
will
do:
"A
MISSOURI
MAIDEN'S
FAREWELL
TO
ALABAMA
"Alabama,
good-bye!
I
love
thee
well!
But
yet
for
a
while
do
I
leave
thee
now!
Sad,
yes,
sad
thoughts
of
thee
my
heart
doth
swell,
And
burning
recollections
throng
my
brow!
For
I
have
wandered
through
thy
flowery
woods;
Have
roamed
and
read
near
Tallapoosa's
stream;
Have
listened
to
Tallassee's
warring
floods,
And
wooed
on
Coosa's
side
Aurora's
beam.
"Yet
shame
I
not
to
bear
an
o'er-full
heart,
Nor
blush
to
turn
behind
my
tearful
eyes;
'Tis
from
no
stranger
land
I
now
must
part,
'Tis
to
no
strangers
left
I
yield
these
sighs.
Welcome
and
home
were
mine
within
this
State,
Whose
vales
I
leave--whose
spires
fade
fast
from
me
And
cold
must
be
mine
eyes,
and
heart,
and
tete,
When,
dear
Alabama!
they
turn
cold
on
thee!"
There
were
very
few
there
who
knew
what
"tete"
meant,
but
the
poem
was
very
satisfactory,
nevertheless.
Next
appeared
a
dark-complexioned,
black-eyed,
black-haired
young
lady,
who
paused
an
impressive
moment,
assumed
a
tragic
expression,
and
began
to
read
in
a
measured,
solemn
tone:
"A
VISION
"Dark
and
tempestuous
was
night.
Around
the
throne
on
high
not
a
single
star
quivered;
but
the
deep
intonations
of
the
heavy
thunder
constantly
vibrated
upon
the
ear;
whilst
the
terrific
lightning
revelled
in
angry
mood
through
the
cloudy
chambers
of
heaven,
seeming
to
scorn
the
power
exerted
over
its
terror
by
the
illustrious
Franklin!
Even
the
boisterous
winds
unanimously
came
forth
from
their
mystic
homes,
and
blustered
about
as
if
to
enhance
by
their
aid
the
wildness
of
the
scene.
"At
such
a
time,
so
dark,
so
dreary,
for
human
sympathy
my
very
spirit
sighed;
but
instead
thereof,
"'My
dearest
friend,
my
counsellor,
my
comforter
and
guide--My
joy
in
grief,
my
second
bliss
in
joy,'
came
to
my
side.
She
moved
like
one
of
those
bright
beings
pictured
in
the
sunny
walks
of
fancy's
Eden
by
the
romantic
and
young,
a
queen
of
beauty
unadorned
save
by
her
own
transcendent
loveliness.
So
soft
was
her
step,
it
failed
to
make
even
a
sound,
and
but
for
the
magical
thrill
imparted
by
her
genial
touch,
as
other
unobtrusive
beauties,
she
would
have
glided
away
un-perceived--unsought.
A
strange
sadness
rested
upon
her
features,
like
icy
tears
upon
the
robe
of
December,
as
she
pointed
to
the
contending
elements
without,
and
bade
me
contemplate
the
two
beings
presented."
This
nightmare
occupied
some
ten
pages
of
manuscript
and
wound
up
with
a
sermon
so
destructive
of
all
hope
to
non-Presbyterians
that
it
took
the
first
prize.
This
composition
was
considered
to
be
the
very
finest
effort
of
the
evening.
The
mayor
of
the
village,
in
delivering
the
prize
to
the
author
of
it,
made
a
warm
speech
in
which
he
said
that
it
was
by
far
the
most
"eloquent"
thing
he
had
ever
listened
to,
and
that
Daniel
Webster
himself
might
well
be
proud
of
it.
It
may
be
remarked,
in
passing,
that
the
number
of
compositions
in
which
the
word
"beauteous"
was
over-fondled,
and
human
experience
referred
to
as
"life's
page,"
was
up
to
the
usual
average.
Now
the
master,
mellow
almost
to
the
verge
of
geniality,
put
his
chair
aside,
turned
his
back
to
the
audience,
and
began
to
draw
a
map
of
America
on
the
blackboard,
to
exercise
the
geography
class
upon.
But
he
made
a
sad
business
of
it
with
his
unsteady
hand,
and
a
smothered
titter
rippled
over
the
house.
He
knew
what
the
matter
was,
and
set
himself
to
right
it.
He
sponged
out
lines
and
remade
them;
but
he
only
distorted
them
more
than
ever,
and
the
tittering
was
more
pronounced.
He
threw
his
entire
attention
upon
his
work,
now,
as
if
determined
not
to
be
put
down
by
the
mirth.
He
felt
that
all
eyes
were
fastened
upon
him;
he
imagined
he
was
succeeding,
and
yet
the
tittering
continued;
it
even
manifestly
increased.
And
well
it
might.
There
was
a
garret
above,
pierced
with
a
scuttle
over
his
head;
and
down
through
this
scuttle
came
a
cat,
suspended
around
the
haunches
by
a
string;
she
had
a
rag
tied
about
her
head
and
jaws
to
keep
her
from
mewing;
as
she
slowly
descended
she
curved
upward
and
clawed
at
the
string,
she
swung
downward
and
clawed
at
the
intangible
air.
The
tittering
rose
higher
and
higher--the
cat
was
within
six
inches
of
the
absorbed
teacher's
head--down,
down,
a
little
lower,
and
she
grabbed
his
wig
with
her
desperate
claws,
clung
to
it,
and
was
snatched
up
into
the
garret
in
an
instant
with
her
trophy
still
in
her
possession!
And
how
the
light
did
blaze
abroad
from
the
master's
bald
pate--for
the
sign-painter's
boy
had
GILDED
it!
That
broke
up
the
meeting.
The
boys
were
avenged.
Vacation
had
come.
NOTE:--The
pretended
"compositions"
quoted
in
this
chapter
are
taken
without
alteration
from
a
volume
entitled
"Prose
and
Poetry,
by
a
Western
Lady"--but
they
are
exactly
and
precisely
after
the
schoolgirl
pattern,
and
hence
are
much
happier
than
any
mere
imitations
could
be.
CHAPTER
XXII
TOM
joined
the
new
order
of
Cadets
of
Temperance,
being
attracted
by
the
showy
character
of
their
"regalia."
He
promised
to
abstain
from
smoking,
chewing,
and
profanity
as
long
as
he
remained
a
member.
Now
he
found
out
a
new
thing--namely,
that
to
promise
not
to
do
a
thing
is
the
surest
way
in
the
world
to
make
a
body
want
to
go
and
do
that
very
thing.
Tom
soon
found
himself
tormented
with
a
desire
to
drink
and
swear;
the
desire
grew
to
be
so
intense
that
nothing
but
the
hope
of
a
chance
to
display
himself
in
his
red
sash
kept
him
from
withdrawing
from
the
order.
Fourth
of
July
was
coming;
but
he
soon
gave
that
up
--gave
it
up
before
he
had
worn
his
shackles
over
forty-eight
hours--and
fixed
his
hopes
upon
old
Judge
Frazer,
justice
of
the
peace,
who
was
apparently
on
his
deathbed
and
would
have
a
big
public
funeral,
since
he
was
so
high
an
official.
During
three
days
Tom
was
deeply
concerned
about
the
Judge's
condition
and
hungry
for
news
of
it.
Sometimes
his
hopes
ran
high--so
high
that
he
would
venture
to
get
out
his
regalia
and
practise
before
the
looking-glass.
But
the
Judge
had
a
most
discouraging
way
of
fluctuating.
At
last
he
was
pronounced
upon
the
mend--and
then
convalescent.
Tom
was
disgusted;
and
felt
a
sense
of
injury,
too.
He
handed
in
his
resignation
at
once--and
that
night
the
Judge
suffered
a
relapse
and
died.
Tom
resolved
that
he
would
never
trust
a
man
like
that
again.
The
funeral
was
a
fine
thing.
The
Cadets
paraded
in
a
style
calculated
to
kill
the
late
member
with
envy.
Tom
was
a
free
boy
again,
however
--there
was
something
in
that.
He
could
drink
and
swear,
now--but
found
to
his
surprise
that
he
did
not
want
to.
The
simple
fact
that
he
could,
took
the
desire
away,
and
the
charm
of
it.
Tom
presently
wondered
to
find
that
his
coveted
vacation
was
beginning
to
hang
a
little
heavily
on
his
hands.
He
attempted
a
diary--but
nothing
happened
during
three
days,
and
so
he
abandoned
it.
The
first
of
all
the
negro
minstrel
shows
came
to
town,
and
made
a
sensation.
Tom
and
Joe
Harper
got
up
a
band
of
performers
and
were
happy
for
two
days.
Even
the
Glorious
Fourth
was
in
some
sense
a
failure,
for
it
rained
hard,
there
was
no
procession
in
consequence,
and
the
greatest
man
in
the
world
(as
Tom
supposed),
Mr.
Benton,
an
actual
United
States
Senator,
proved
an
overwhelming
disappointment--for
he
was
not
twenty-five
feet
high,
nor
even
anywhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
it.
A
circus
came.
The
boys
played
circus
for
three
days
afterward
in
tents
made
of
rag
carpeting--admission,
three
pins
for
boys,
two
for
girls--and
then
circusing
was
abandoned.
A
phrenologist
and
a
mesmerizer
came--and
went
again
and
left
the
village
duller
and
drearier
than
ever.
There
were
some
boys-and-girls'
parties,
but
they
were
so
few
and
so
delightful
that
they
only
made
the
aching
voids
between
ache
the
harder.
Becky
Thatcher
was
gone
to
her
Constantinople
home
to
stay
with
her
parents
during
vacation--so
there
was
no
bright
side
to
life
anywhere.
The
dreadful
secret
of
the
murder
was
a
chronic
misery.
It
was
a
very
cancer
for
permanency
and
pain.
Then
came
the
measles.
During
two
long
weeks
Tom
lay
a
prisoner,
dead
to
the
world
and
its
happenings.
He
was
very
ill,
he
was
interested
in
nothing.
When
he
got
upon
his
feet
at
last
and
moved
feebly
down-town,
a
melancholy
change
had
come
over
everything
and
every
creature.
There
had
been
a
"revival,"
and
everybody
had
"got
religion,"
not
only
the
adults,
but
even
the
boys
and
girls.
Tom
went
about,
hoping
against
hope
for
the
sight
of
one
blessed
sinful
face,
but
disappointment
crossed
him
everywhere.
He
found
Joe
Harper
studying
a
Testament,
and
turned
sadly
away
from
the
depressing
spectacle.
He
sought
Ben
Rogers,
and
found
him
visiting
the
poor
with
a
basket
of
tracts.
He
hunted
up
Jim
Hollis,
who
called
his
attention
to
the
precious
blessing
of
his
late
measles
as
a
warning.
Every
boy
he
encountered
added
another
ton
to
his
depression;
and
when,
in
desperation,
he
flew
for
refuge
at
last
to
the
bosom
of
Huckleberry
Finn
and
was
received
with
a
Scriptural
quotation,
his
heart
broke
and
he
crept
home
and
to
bed
realizing
that
he
alone
of
all
the
town
was
lost,
forever
and
forever.
And
that
night
there
came
on
a
terrific
storm,
with
driving
rain,
awful
claps
of
thunder
and
blinding
sheets
of
lightning.
He
covered
his
head
with
the
bedclothes
and
waited
in
a
horror
of
suspense
for
his
doom;
for
he
had
not
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
all
this
hubbub
was
about
him.
He
believed
he
had
taxed
the
forbearance
of
the
powers
above
to
the
extremity
of
endurance
and
that
this
was
the
result.
It
might
have
seemed
to
him
a
waste
of
pomp
and
ammunition
to
kill
a
bug
with
a
battery
of
artillery,
but
there
seemed
nothing
incongruous
about
the
getting
up
such
an
expensive
thunderstorm
as
this
to
knock
the
turf
from
under
an
insect
like
himself.
By
and
by
the
tempest
spent
itself
and
died
without
accomplishing
its
object.
The
boy's
first
impulse
was
to
be
grateful,
and
reform.
His
second
was
to
wait--for
there
might
not
be
any
more
storms.
The
next
day
the
doctors
were
back;
Tom
had
relapsed.
The
three
weeks
he
spent
on
his
back
this
time
seemed
an
entire
age.
When
he
got
abroad
at
last
he
was
hardly
grateful
that
he
had
been
spared,
remembering
how
lonely
was
his
estate,
how
companionless
and
forlorn
he
was.
He
drifted
listlessly
down
the
street
and
found
Jim
Hollis
acting
as
judge
in
a
juvenile
court
that
was
trying
a
cat
for
murder,
in
the
presence
of
her
victim,
a
bird.
He
found
Joe
Harper
and
Huck
Finn
up
an
alley
eating
a
stolen
melon.
Poor
lads!
they--like
Tom--had
suffered
a
relapse.
CHAPTER
XXIII
AT
last
the
sleepy
atmosphere
was
stirred--and
vigorously:
the
murder
trial
came
on
in
the
court.
It
became
the
absorbing
topic
of
village
talk
immediately.
Tom
could
not
get
away
from
it.
Every
reference
to
the
murder
sent
a
shudder
to
his
heart,
for
his
troubled
conscience
and
fears
almost
persuaded
him
that
these
remarks
were
put
forth
in
his
hearing
as
"feelers";
he
did
not
see
how
he
could
be
suspected
of
knowing
anything
about
the
murder,
but
still
he
could
not
be
comfortable
in
the
midst
of
this
gossip.
It
kept
him
in
a
cold
shiver
all
the
time.
He
took
Huck
to
a
lonely
place
to
have
a
talk
with
him.
It
would
be
some
relief
to
unseal
his
tongue
for
a
little
while;
to
divide
his
burden
of
distress
with
another
sufferer.
Moreover,
he
wanted
to
assure
himself
that
Huck
had
remained
discreet.
"Huck,
have
you
ever
told
anybody
about--that?"
"'Bout
what?"
"You
know
what."
"Oh--'course
I
haven't."
"Never
a
word?"
"Never
a
solitary
word,
so
help
me.
What
makes
you
ask?"
"Well,
I
was
afeard."
"Why,
Tom
Sawyer,
we
wouldn't
be
alive
two
days
if
that
got
found
out.
YOU
know
that."
Tom
felt
more
comfortable.
After
a
pause:
"Huck,
they
couldn't
anybody
get
you
to
tell,
could
they?"
"Get
me
to
tell?
Why,
if
I
wanted
that
half-breed
devil
to
drownd
me
they
could
get
me
to
tell.
They
ain't
no
different
way."
"Well,
that's
all
right,
then.
I
reckon
we're
safe
as
long
as
we
keep
mum.
But
let's
swear
again,
anyway.
It's
more
surer."
"I'm
agreed."
So
they
swore
again
with
dread
solemnities.
"What
is
the
talk
around,
Huck?
I've
heard
a
power
of
it."
"Talk?
Well,
it's
just
Muff
Potter,
Muff
Potter,
Muff
Potter
all
the
time.
It
keeps
me
in
a
sweat,
constant,
so's
I
want
to
hide
som'ers."
"That's
just
the
same
way
they
go
on
round
me.
I
reckon
he's
a
goner.
Don't
you
feel
sorry
for
him,
sometimes?"
"Most
always--most
always.
He
ain't
no
account;
but
then
he
hain't
ever
done
anything
to
hurt
anybody.
Just
fishes
a
little,
to
get
money
to
get
drunk
on--and
loafs
around
considerable;
but
lord,
we
all
do
that--leastways
most
of
us--preachers
and
such
like.
But
he's
kind
of
good--he
give
me
half
a
fish,
once,
when
there
warn't
enough
for
two;
and
lots
of
times
he's
kind
of
stood
by
me
when
I
was
out
of
luck."
"Well,
he's
mended
kites
for
me,
Huck,
and
knitted
hooks
on
to
my
line.
I
wish
we
could
get
him
out
of
there."
"My!
we
couldn't
get
him
out,
Tom.
And
besides,
'twouldn't
do
any
good;
they'd
ketch
him
again."
"Yes--so
they
would.
But
I
hate
to
hear
'em
abuse
him
so
like
the
dickens
when
he
never
done--that."
"I
do
too,
Tom.
Lord,
I
hear
'em
say
he's
the
bloodiest
looking
villain
in
this
country,
and
they
wonder
he
wasn't
ever
hung
before."
"Yes,
they
talk
like
that,
all
the
time.
I've
heard
'em
say
that
if
he
was
to
get
free
they'd
lynch
him."
"And
they'd
do
it,
too."
The
boys
had
a
long
talk,
but
it
brought
them
little
comfort.
As
the
twilight
drew
on,
they
found
themselves
hanging
about
the
neighborhood
of
the
little
isolated
jail,
perhaps
with
an
undefined
hope
that
something
would
happen
that
might
clear
away
their
difficulties.
But
nothing
happened;
there
seemed
to
be
no
angels
or
fairies
interested
in
this
luckless
captive.
The
boys
did
as
they
had
often
done
before--went
to
the
cell
grating
and
gave
Potter
some
tobacco
and
matches.
He
was
on
the
ground
floor
and
there
were
no
guards.
His
gratitude
for
their
gifts
had
always
smote
their
consciences
before--it
cut
deeper
than
ever,
this
time.
They
felt
cowardly
and
treacherous
to
the
last
degree
when
Potter
said:
"You've
been
mighty
good
to
me,
boys--better'n
anybody
else
in
this
town.
And
I
don't
forget
it,
I
don't.
Often
I
says
to
myself,
says
I,
'I
used
to
mend
all
the
boys'
kites
and
things,
and
show
'em
where
the
good
fishin'
places
was,
and
befriend
'em
what
I
could,
and
now
they've
all
forgot
old
Muff
when
he's
in
trouble;
but
Tom
don't,
and
Huck
don't--THEY
don't
forget
him,
says
I,
'and
I
don't
forget
them.'
Well,
boys,
I
done
an
awful
thing--drunk
and
crazy
at
the
time--that's
the
only
way
I
account
for
it--and
now
I
got
to
swing
for
it,
and
it's
right.
Right,
and
BEST,
too,
I
reckon--hope
so,
anyway.
Well,
we
won't
talk
about
that.
I
don't
want
to
make
YOU
feel
bad;
you've
befriended
me.
But
what
I
want
to
say,
is,
don't
YOU
ever
get
drunk--then
you
won't
ever
get
here.
Stand
a
litter
furder
west--so--that's
it;
it's
a
prime
comfort
to
see
faces
that's
friendly
when
a
body's
in
such
a
muck
of
trouble,
and
there
don't
none
come
here
but
yourn.
Good
friendly
faces--good
friendly
faces.
Git
up
on
one
another's
backs
and
let
me
touch
'em.
That's
it.
Shake
hands--yourn'll
come
through
the
bars,
but
mine's
too
big.
Little
hands,
and
weak--but
they've
helped
Muff
Potter
a
power,
and
they'd
help
him
more
if
they
could."
Tom
went
home
miserable,
and
his
dreams
that
night
were
full
of
horrors.
The
next
day
and
the
day
after,
he
hung
about
the
court-room,
drawn
by
an
almost
irresistible
impulse
to
go
in,
but
forcing
himself
to
stay
out.
Huck
was
having
the
same
experience.
They
studiously
avoided
each
other.
Each
wandered
away,
from
time
to
time,
but
the
same
dismal
fascination
always
brought
them
back
presently.
Tom
kept
his
ears
open
when
idlers
sauntered
out
of
the
court-room,
but
invariably
heard
distressing
news--the
toils
were
closing
more
and
more
relentlessly
around
poor
Potter.
At
the
end
of
the
second
day
the
village
talk
was
to
the
effect
that
Injun
Joe's
evidence
stood
firm
and
unshaken,
and
that
there
was
not
the
slightest
question
as
to
what
the
jury's
verdict
would
be.
Tom
was
out
late,
that
night,
and
came
to
bed
through
the
window.
He
was
in
a
tremendous
state
of
excitement.
It
was
hours
before
he
got
to
sleep.
All
the
village
flocked
to
the
court-house
the
next
morning,
for
this
was
to
be
the
great
day.
Both
sexes
were
about
equally
represented
in
the
packed
audience.
After
a
long
wait
the
jury
filed
in
and
took
their
places;
shortly
afterward,
Potter,
pale
and
haggard,
timid
and
hopeless,
was
brought
in,
with
chains
upon
him,
and
seated
where
all
the
curious
eyes
could
stare
at
him;
no
less
conspicuous
was
Injun
Joe,
stolid
as
ever.
There
was
another
pause,
and
then
the
judge
arrived
and
the
sheriff
proclaimed
the
opening
of
the
court.
The
usual
whisperings
among
the
lawyers
and
gathering
together
of
papers
followed.
These
details
and
accompanying
delays
worked
up
an
atmosphere
of
preparation
that
was
as
impressive
as
it
was
fascinating.
Now
a
witness
was
called
who
testified
that
he
found
Muff
Potter
washing
in
the
brook,
at
an
early
hour
of
the
morning
that
the
murder
was
discovered,
and
that
he
immediately
sneaked
away.
After
some
further
questioning,
counsel
for
the
prosecution
said:
"Take
the
witness."
The
prisoner
raised
his
eyes
for
a
moment,
but
dropped
them
again
when
his
own
counsel
said:
"I
have
no
questions
to
ask
him."
The
next
witness
proved
the
finding
of
the
knife
near
the
corpse.
Counsel
for
the
prosecution
said:
"Take
the
witness."
"I
have
no
questions
to
ask
him,"
Potter's
lawyer
replied.
A
third
witness
swore
he
had
often
seen
the
knife
in
Potter's
possession.
"Take
the
witness."
Counsel
for
Potter
declined
to
question
him.
The
faces
of
the
audience
began
to
betray
annoyance.
Did
this
attorney
mean
to
throw
away
his
client's
life
without
an
effort?
Several
witnesses
deposed
concerning
Potter's
guilty
behavior
when
brought
to
the
scene
of
the
murder.
They
were
allowed
to
leave
the
stand
without
being
cross-questioned.
Every
detail
of
the
damaging
circumstances
that
occurred
in
the
graveyard
upon
that
morning
which
all
present
remembered
so
well
was
brought
out
by
credible
witnesses,
but
none
of
them
were
cross-examined
by
Potter's
lawyer.
The
perplexity
and
dissatisfaction
of
the
house
expressed
itself
in
murmurs
and
provoked
a
reproof
from
the
bench.
Counsel
for
the
prosecution
now
said:
"By
the
oaths
of
citizens
whose
simple
word
is
above
suspicion,
we
have
fastened
this
awful
crime,
beyond
all
possibility
of
question,
upon
the
unhappy
prisoner
at
the
bar.
We
rest
our
case
here."
A
groan
escaped
from
poor
Potter,
and
he
put
his
face
in
his
hands
and
rocked
his
body
softly
to
and
fro,
while
a
painful
silence
reigned
in
the
court-room.
Many
men
were
moved,
and
many
women's
compassion
testified
itself
in
tears.
Counsel
for
the
defence
rose
and
said:
"Your
honor,
in
our
remarks
at
the
opening
of
this
trial,
we
foreshadowed
our
purpose
to
prove
that
our
client
did
this
fearful
deed
while
under
the
influence
of
a
blind
and
irresponsible
delirium
produced
by
drink.
We
have
changed
our
mind.
We
shall
not
offer
that
plea."
[Then
to
the
clerk:]
"Call
Thomas
Sawyer!"
A
puzzled
amazement
awoke
in
every
face
in
the
house,
not
even
excepting
Potter's.
Every
eye
fastened
itself
with
wondering
interest
upon
Tom
as
he
rose
and
took
his
place
upon
the
stand.
The
boy
looked
wild
enough,
for
he
was
badly
scared.
The
oath
was
administered.
"Thomas
Sawyer,
where
were
you
on
the
seventeenth
of
June,
about
the
hour
of
midnight?"
Tom
glanced
at
Injun
Joe's
iron
face
and
his
tongue
failed
him.
The
audience
listened
breathless,
but
the
words
refused
to
come.
After
a
few
moments,
however,
the
boy
got
a
little
of
his
strength
back,
and
managed
to
put
enough
of
it
into
his
voice
to
make
part
of
the
house
hear:
"In
the
graveyard!"
"A
little
bit
louder,
please.
Don't
be
afraid.
You
were--"
"In
the
graveyard."
A
contemptuous
smile
flitted
across
Injun
Joe's
face.
"Were
you
anywhere
near
Horse
Williams'
grave?"
"Yes,
sir."
"Speak
up--just
a
trifle
louder.
How
near
were
you?"
"Near
as
I
am
to
you."
"Were
you
hidden,
or
not?"
"I
was
hid."
"Where?"
"Behind
the
elms
that's
on
the
edge
of
the
grave."
Injun
Joe
gave
a
barely
perceptible
start.
"Any
one
with
you?"
"Yes,
sir.
I
went
there
with--"
"Wait--wait
a
moment.
Never
mind
mentioning
your
companion's
name.
We
will
produce
him
at
the
proper
time.
Did
you
carry
anything
there
with
you."
Tom
hesitated
and
looked
confused.
"Speak
out,
my
boy--don't
be
diffident.
The
truth
is
always
respectable.
What
did
you
take
there?"
"Only
a--a--dead
cat."
There
was
a
ripple
of
mirth,
which
the
court
checked.
"We
will
produce
the
skeleton
of
that
cat.
Now,
my
boy,
tell
us
everything
that
occurred--tell
it
in
your
own
way--don't
skip
anything,
and
don't
be
afraid."
Tom
began--hesitatingly
at
first,
but
as
he
warmed
to
his
subject
his
words
flowed
more
and
more
easily;
in
a
little
while
every
sound
ceased
but
his
own
voice;
every
eye
fixed
itself
upon
him;
with
parted
lips
and
bated
breath
the
audience
hung
upon
his
words,
taking
no
note
of
time,
rapt
in
the
ghastly
fascinations
of
the
tale.
The
strain
upon
pent
emotion
reached
its
climax
when
the
boy
said:
"--and
as
the
doctor
fetched
the
board
around
and
Muff
Potter
fell,
Injun
Joe
jumped
with
the
knife
and--"
Crash!
Quick
as
lightning
the
half-breed
sprang
for
a
window,
tore
his
way
through
all
opposers,
and
was
gone!
CHAPTER
XXIV
TOM
was
a
glittering
hero
once
more--the
pet
of
the
old,
the
envy
of
the
young.
His
name
even
went
into
immortal
print,
for
the
village
paper
magnified
him.
There
were
some
that
believed
he
would
be
President,
yet,
if
he
escaped
hanging.
As
usual,
the
fickle,
unreasoning
world
took
Muff
Potter
to
its
bosom
and
fondled
him
as
lavishly
as
it
had
abused
him
before.
But
that
sort
of
conduct
is
to
the
world's
credit;
therefore
it
is
not
well
to
find
fault
with
it.
Tom's
days
were
days
of
splendor
and
exultation
to
him,
but
his
nights
were
seasons
of
horror.
Injun
Joe
infested
all
his
dreams,
and
always
with
doom
in
his
eye.
Hardly
any
temptation
could
persuade
the
boy
to
stir
abroad
after
nightfall.
Poor
Huck
was
in
the
same
state
of
wretchedness
and
terror,
for
Tom
had
told
the
whole
story
to
the
lawyer
the
night
before
the
great
day
of
the
trial,
and
Huck
was
sore
afraid
that
his
share
in
the
business
might
leak
out,
yet,
notwithstanding
Injun
Joe's
flight
had
saved
him
the
suffering
of
testifying
in
court.
The
poor
fellow
had
got
the
attorney
to
promise
secrecy,
but
what
of
that?
Since
Tom's
harassed
conscience
had
managed
to
drive
him
to
the
lawyer's
house
by
night
and
wring
a
dread
tale
from
lips
that
had
been
sealed
with
the
dismalest
and
most
formidable
of
oaths,
Huck's
confidence
in
the
human
race
was
well-nigh
obliterated.
Daily
Muff
Potter's
gratitude
made
Tom
glad
he
had
spoken;
but
nightly
he
wished
he
had
sealed
up
his
tongue.
Half
the
time
Tom
was
afraid
Injun
Joe
would
never
be
captured;
the
other
half
he
was
afraid
he
would
be.
He
felt
sure
he
never
could
draw
a
safe
breath
again
until
that
man
was
dead
and
he
had
seen
the
corpse.
Rewards
had
been
offered,
the
country
had
been
scoured,
but
no
Injun
Joe
was
found.
One
of
those
omniscient
and
awe-inspiring
marvels,
a
detective,
came
up
from
St.
Louis,
moused
around,
shook
his
head,
looked
wise,
and
made
that
sort
of
astounding
success
which
members
of
that
craft
usually
achieve.
That
is
to
say,
he
"found
a
clew."
But
you
can't
hang
a
"clew"
for
murder,
and
so
after
that
detective
had
got
through
and
gone
home,
Tom
felt
just
as
insecure
as
he
was
before.
The
slow
days
drifted
on,
and
each
left
behind
it
a
slightly
lightened
weight
of
apprehension.
CHAPTER
XXV
THERE
comes
a
time
in
every
rightly-constructed
boy's
life
when
he
has
a
raging
desire
to
go
somewhere
and
dig
for
hidden
treasure.
This
desire
suddenly
came
upon
Tom
one
day.
He
sallied
out
to
find
Joe
Harper,
but
failed
of
success.
Next
he
sought
Ben
Rogers;
he
had
gone
fishing.
Presently
he
stumbled
upon
Huck
Finn
the
Red-Handed.
Huck
would
answer.
Tom
took
him
to
a
private
place
and
opened
the
matter
to
him
confidentially.
Huck
was
willing.
Huck
was
always
willing
to
take
a
hand
in
any
enterprise
that
offered
entertainment
and
required
no
capital,
for
he
had
a
troublesome
superabundance
of
that
sort
of
time
which
is
not
money.
"Where'll
we
dig?"
said
Huck.
"Oh,
most
anywhere."
"Why,
is
it
hid
all
around?"
"No,
indeed
it
ain't.
It's
hid
in
mighty
particular
places,
Huck
--sometimes
on
islands,
sometimes
in
rotten
chests
under
the
end
of
a
limb
of
an
old
dead
tree,
just
where
the
shadow
falls
at
midnight;
but
mostly
under
the
floor
in
ha'nted
houses."
"Who
hides
it?"
"Why,
robbers,
of
course--who'd
you
reckon?
Sunday-school
sup'rintendents?"
"I
don't
know.
If
'twas
mine
I
wouldn't
hide
it;
I'd
spend
it
and
have
a
good
time."
"So
would
I.
But
robbers
don't
do
that
way.
They
always
hide
it
and
leave
it
there."
"Don't
they
come
after
it
any
more?"
"No,
they
think
they
will,
but
they
generally
forget
the
marks,
or
else
they
die.
Anyway,
it
lays
there
a
long
time
and
gets
rusty;
and
by
and
by
somebody
finds
an
old
yellow
paper
that
tells
how
to
find
the
marks--a
paper
that's
got
to
be
ciphered
over
about
a
week
because
it's
mostly
signs
and
hy'roglyphics."
"HyroQwhich?"
"Hy'roglyphics--pictures
and
things,
you
know,
that
don't
seem
to
mean
anything."
"Have
you
got
one
of
them
papers,
Tom?"
"No."
"Well
then,
how
you
going
to
find
the
marks?"
"I
don't
want
any
marks.
They
always
bury
it
under
a
ha'nted
house
or
on
an
island,
or
under
a
dead
tree
that's
got
one
limb
sticking
out.
Well,
we've
tried
Jackson's
Island
a
little,
and
we
can
try
it
again
some
time;
and
there's
the
old
ha'nted
house
up
the
Still-House
branch,
and
there's
lots
of
dead-limb
trees--dead
loads
of
'em."
"Is
it
under
all
of
them?"
"How
you
talk!
No!"
"Then
how
you
going
to
know
which
one
to
go
for?"
"Go
for
all
of
'em!"
"Why,
Tom,
it'll
take
all
summer."
"Well,
what
of
that?
Suppose
you
find
a
brass
pot
with
a
hundred
dollars
in
it,
all
rusty
and
gray,
or
rotten
chest
full
of
di'monds.
How's
that?"
Huck's
eyes
glowed.
"That's
bully.
Plenty
bully
enough
for
me.
Just
you
gimme
the
hundred
dollars
and
I
don't
want
no
di'monds."
"All
right.
But
I
bet
you
I
ain't
going
to
throw
off
on
di'monds.
Some
of
'em's
worth
twenty
dollars
apiece--there
ain't
any,
hardly,
but's
worth
six
bits
or
a
dollar."
"No!
Is
that
so?"
"Cert'nly--anybody'll
tell
you
so.
Hain't
you
ever
seen
one,
Huck?"
"Not
as
I
remember."
"Oh,
kings
have
slathers
of
them."
"Well,
I
don'
know
no
kings,
Tom."
"I
reckon
you
don't.
But
if
you
was
to
go
to
Europe
you'd
see
a
raft
of
'em
hopping
around."
"Do
they
hop?"
"Hop?--your
granny!
No!"
"Well,
what
did
you
say
they
did,
for?"
"Shucks,
I
only
meant
you'd
SEE
'em--not
hopping,
of
course--what
do
they
want
to
hop
for?--but
I
mean
you'd
just
see
'em--scattered
around,
you
know,
in
a
kind
of
a
general
way.
Like
that
old
humpbacked
Richard."
"Richard?
What's
his
other
name?"
"He
didn't
have
any
other
name.
Kings
don't
have
any
but
a
given
name."
"No?"
"But
they
don't."
"Well,
if
they
like
it,
Tom,
all
right;
but
I
don't
want
to
be
a
king
and
have
only
just
a
given
name,
like
a
nigger.
But
say--where
you
going
to
dig
first?"
"Well,
I
don't
know.
S'pose
we
tackle
that
old
dead-limb
tree
on
the
hill
t'other
side
of
Still-House
branch?"
"I'm
agreed."
So
they
got
a
crippled
pick
and
a
shovel,
and
set
out
on
their
three-mile
tramp.
They
arrived
hot
and
panting,
and
threw
themselves
down
in
the
shade
of
a
neighboring
elm
to
rest
and
have
a
smoke.
"I
like
this,"
said
Tom.
"So
do
I."
"Say,
Huck,
if
we
find
a
treasure
here,
what
you
going
to
do
with
your
share?"
"Well,
I'll
have
pie
and
a
glass
of
soda
every
day,
and
I'll
go
to
every
circus
that
comes
along.
I
bet
I'll
have
a
gay
time."
"Well,
ain't
you
going
to
save
any
of
it?"
"Save
it?
What
for?"
"Why,
so
as
to
have
something
to
live
on,
by
and
by."
"Oh,
that
ain't
any
use.
Pap
would
come
back
to
thish-yer
town
some
day
and
get
his
claws
on
it
if
I
didn't
hurry
up,
and
I
tell
you
he'd
clean
it
out
pretty
quick.
What
you
going
to
do
with
yourn,
Tom?"
"I'm
going
to
buy
a
new
drum,
and
a
sure-'nough
sword,
and
a
red
necktie
and
a
bull
pup,
and
get
married."
"Married!"
"That's
it."
"Tom,
you--why,
you
ain't
in
your
right
mind."
"Wait--you'll
see."
"Well,
that's
the
foolishest
thing
you
could
do.
Look
at
pap
and
my
mother.
Fight!
Why,
they
used
to
fight
all
the
time.
I
remember,
mighty
well."
"That
ain't
anything.
The
girl
I'm
going
to
marry
won't
fight."
"Tom,
I
reckon
they're
all
alike.
They'll
all
comb
a
body.
Now
you
better
think
'bout
this
awhile.
I
tell
you
you
better.
What's
the
name
of
the
gal?"
"It
ain't
a
gal
at
all--it's
a
girl."
"It's
all
the
same,
I
reckon;
some
says
gal,
some
says
girl--both's
right,
like
enough.
Anyway,
what's
her
name,
Tom?"
"I'll
tell
you
some
time--not
now."
"All
right--that'll
do.
Only
if
you
get
married
I'll
be
more
lonesomer
than
ever."
"No
you
won't.
You'll
come
and
live
with
me.
Now
stir
out
of
this
and
we'll
go
to
digging."
They
worked
and
sweated
for
half
an
hour.
No
result.
They
toiled
another
half-hour.
Still
no
result.
Huck
said:
"Do
they
always
bury
it
as
deep
as
this?"
"Sometimes--not
always.
Not
generally.
I
reckon
we
haven't
got
the
right
place."
So
they
chose
a
new
spot
and
began
again.
The
labor
dragged
a
little,
but
still
they
made
progress.
They
pegged
away
in
silence
for
some
time.
Finally
Huck
leaned
on
his
shovel,
swabbed
the
beaded
drops
from
his
brow
with
his
sleeve,
and
said:
"Where
you
going
to
dig
next,
after
we
get
this
one?"
"I
reckon
maybe
we'll
tackle
the
old
tree
that's
over
yonder
on
Cardiff
Hill
back
of
the
widow's."
"I
reckon
that'll
be
a
good
one.
But
won't
the
widow
take
it
away
from
us,
Tom?
It's
on
her
land."
"SHE
take
it
away!
Maybe
she'd
like
to
try
it
once.
Whoever
finds
one
of
these
hid
treasures,
it
belongs
to
him.
It
don't
make
any
difference
whose
land
it's
on."
That
was
satisfactory.
The
work
went
on.
By
and
by
Huck
said:
"Blame
it,
we
must
be
in
the
wrong
place
again.
What
do
you
think?"
"It
is
mighty
curious,
Huck.
I
don't
understand
it.
Sometimes
witches
interfere.
I
reckon
maybe
that's
what's
the
trouble
now."
"Shucks!
Witches
ain't
got
no
power
in
the
daytime."
"Well,
that's
so.
I
didn't
think
of
that.
Oh,
I
know
what
the
matter
is!
What
a
blamed
lot
of
fools
we
are!
You
got
to
find
out
where
the
shadow
of
the
limb
falls
at
midnight,
and
that's
where
you
dig!"
"Then
consound
it,
we've
fooled
away
all
this
work
for
nothing.
Now
hang
it
all,
we
got
to
come
back
in
the
night.
It's
an
awful
long
way.
Can
you
get
out?"
"I
bet
I
will.
We've
got
to
do
it
to-night,
too,
because
if
somebody
sees
these
holes
they'll
know
in
a
minute
what's
here
and
they'll
go
for
it."
"Well,
I'll
come
around
and
maow
to-night."
"All
right.
Let's
hide
the
tools
in
the
bushes."
The
boys
were
there
that
night,
about
the
appointed
time.
They
sat
in
the
shadow
waiting.
It
was
a
lonely
place,
and
an
hour
made
solemn
by
old
traditions.
Spirits
whispered
in
the
rustling
leaves,
ghosts
lurked
in
the
murky
nooks,
the
deep
baying
of
a
hound
floated
up
out
of
the
distance,
an
owl
answered
with
his
sepulchral
note.
The
boys
were
subdued
by
these
solemnities,
and
talked
little.
By
and
by
they
judged
that
twelve
had
come;
they
marked
where
the
shadow
fell,
and
began
to
dig.
Their
hopes
commenced
to
rise.
Their
interest
grew
stronger,
and
their
industry
kept
pace
with
it.
The
hole
deepened
and
still
deepened,
but
every
time
their
hearts
jumped
to
hear
the
pick
strike
upon
something,
they
only
suffered
a
new
disappointment.
It
was
only
a
stone
or
a
chunk.
At
last
Tom
said:
"It
ain't
any
use,
Huck,
we're
wrong
again."
"Well,
but
we
CAN'T
be
wrong.
We
spotted
the
shadder
to
a
dot."
"I
know
it,
but
then
there's
another
thing."
"What's
that?".
"Why,
we
only
guessed
at
the
time.
Like
enough
it
was
too
late
or
too
early."
Huck
dropped
his
shovel.
"That's
it,"
said
he.
"That's
the
very
trouble.
We
got
to
give
this
one
up.
We
can't
ever
tell
the
right
time,
and
besides
this
kind
of
thing's
too
awful,
here
this
time
of
night
with
witches
and
ghosts
a-fluttering
around
so.
I
feel
as
if
something's
behind
me
all
the
time;
and
I'm
afeard
to
turn
around,
becuz
maybe
there's
others
in
front
a-waiting
for
a
chance.
I
been
creeping
all
over,
ever
since
I
got
here."
"Well,
I've
been
pretty
much
so,
too,
Huck.
They
most
always
put
in
a
dead
man
when
they
bury
a
treasure
under
a
tree,
to
look
out
for
it."
"Lordy!"
"Yes,
they
do.
I've
always
heard
that."
"Tom,
I
don't
like
to
fool
around
much
where
there's
dead
people.
A
body's
bound
to
get
into
trouble
with
'em,
sure."
"I
don't
like
to
stir
'em
up,
either.
S'pose
this
one
here
was
to
stick
his
skull
out
and
say
something!"
"Don't
Tom!
It's
awful."
"Well,
it
just
is.
Huck,
I
don't
feel
comfortable
a
bit."
"Say,
Tom,
let's
give
this
place
up,
and
try
somewheres
else."
"All
right,
I
reckon
we
better."
"What'll
it
be?"
Tom
considered
awhile;
and
then
said:
"The
ha'nted
house.
That's
it!"
"Blame
it,
I
don't
like
ha'nted
houses,
Tom.
Why,
they're
a
dern
sight
worse'n
dead
people.
Dead
people
might
talk,
maybe,
but
they
don't
come
sliding
around
in
a
shroud,
when
you
ain't
noticing,
and
peep
over
your
shoulder
all
of
a
sudden
and
grit
their
teeth,
the
way
a
ghost
does.
I
couldn't
stand
such
a
thing
as
that,
Tom--nobody
could."
"Yes,
but,
Huck,
ghosts
don't
travel
around
only
at
night.
They
won't
hender
us
from
digging
there
in
the
daytime."
"Well,
that's
so.
But
you
know
mighty
well
people
don't
go
about
that
ha'nted
house
in
the
day
nor
the
night."
"Well,
that's
mostly
because
they
don't
like
to
go
where
a
man's
been
murdered,
anyway--but
nothing's
ever
been
seen
around
that
house
except
in
the
night--just
some
blue
lights
slipping
by
the
windows--no
regular
ghosts."
"Well,
where
you
see
one
of
them
blue
lights
flickering
around,
Tom,
you
can
bet
there's
a
ghost
mighty
close
behind
it.
It
stands
to
reason.
Becuz
you
know
that
they
don't
anybody
but
ghosts
use
'em."
"Yes,
that's
so.
But
anyway
they
don't
come
around
in
the
daytime,
so
what's
the
use
of
our
being
afeard?"
"Well,
all
right.
We'll
tackle
the
ha'nted
house
if
you
say
so--but
I
reckon
it's
taking
chances."
They
had
started
down
the
hill
by
this
time.
There
in
the
middle
of
the
moonlit
valley
below
them
stood
the
"ha'nted"
house,
utterly
isolated,
its
fences
gone
long
ago,
rank
weeds
smothering
the
very
doorsteps,
the
chimney
crumbled
to
ruin,
the
window-sashes
vacant,
a
corner
of
the
roof
caved
in.
The
boys
gazed
awhile,
half
expecting
to
see
a
blue
light
flit
past
a
window;
then
talking
in
a
low
tone,
as
befitted
the
time
and
the
circumstances,
they
struck
far
off
to
the
right,
to
give
the
haunted
house
a
wide
berth,
and
took
their
way
homeward
through
the
woods
that
adorned
the
rearward
side
of
Cardiff
Hill.
CHAPTER
XXVI
ABOUT
noon
the
next
day
the
boys
arrived
at
the
dead
tree;
they
had
come
for
their
tools.
Tom
was
impatient
to
go
to
the
haunted
house;
Huck
was
measurably
so,
also--but
suddenly
said:
"Lookyhere,
Tom,
do
you
know
what
day
it
is?"
Tom
mentally
ran
over
the
days
of
the
week,
and
then
quickly
lifted
his
eyes
with
a
startled
look
in
them--
"My!
I
never
once
thought
of
it,
Huck!"
"Well,
I
didn't
neither,
but
all
at
once
it
popped
onto
me
that
it
was
Friday."
"Blame
it,
a
body
can't
be
too
careful,
Huck.
We
might
'a'
got
into
an
awful
scrape,
tackling
such
a
thing
on
a
Friday."
"MIGHT!
Better
say
we
WOULD!
There's
some
lucky
days,
maybe,
but
Friday
ain't."
"Any
fool
knows
that.
I
don't
reckon
YOU
was
the
first
that
found
it
out,
Huck."
"Well,
I
never
said
I
was,
did
I?
And
Friday
ain't
all,
neither.
I
had
a
rotten
bad
dream
last
night--dreampt
about
rats."
"No!
Sure
sign
of
trouble.
Did
they
fight?"
"No."
"Well,
that's
good,
Huck.
When
they
don't
fight
it's
only
a
sign
that
there's
trouble
around,
you
know.
All
we
got
to
do
is
to
look
mighty
sharp
and
keep
out
of
it.
We'll
drop
this
thing
for
to-day,
and
play.
Do
you
know
Robin
Hood,
Huck?"
"No.
Who's
Robin
Hood?"
"Why,
he
was
one
of
the
greatest
men
that
was
ever
in
England--and
the
best.
He
was
a
robber."
"Cracky,
I
wisht
I
was.
Who
did
he
rob?"
"Only
sheriffs
and
bishops
and
rich
people
and
kings,
and
such
like.
But
he
never
bothered
the
poor.
He
loved
'em.
He
always
divided
up
with
'em
perfectly
square."
"Well,
he
must
'a'
been
a
brick."
"I
bet
you
he
was,
Huck.
Oh,
he
was
the
noblest
man
that
ever
was.
They
ain't
any
such
men
now,
I
can
tell
you.
He
could
lick
any
man
in
England,
with
one
hand
tied
behind
him;
and
he
could
take
his
yew
bow
and
plug
a
ten-cent
piece
every
time,
a
mile
and
a
half."
"What's
a
YEW
bow?"
"I
don't
know.
It's
some
kind
of
a
bow,
of
course.
And
if
he
hit
that
dime
only
on
the
edge
he
would
set
down
and
cry--and
curse.
But
we'll
play
Robin
Hood--it's
nobby
fun.
I'll
learn
you."
"I'm
agreed."
So
they
played
Robin
Hood
all
the
afternoon,
now
and
then
casting
a
yearning
eye
down
upon
the
haunted
house
and
passing
a
remark
about
the
morrow's
prospects
and
possibilities
there.
As
the
sun
began
to
sink
into
the
west
they
took
their
way
homeward
athwart
the
long
shadows
of
the
trees
and
soon
were
buried
from
sight
in
the
forests
of
Cardiff
Hill.
On
Saturday,
shortly
after
noon,
the
boys
were
at
the
dead
tree
again.
They
had
a
smoke
and
a
chat
in
the
shade,
and
then
dug
a
little
in
their
last
hole,
not
with
great
hope,
but
merely
because
Tom
said
there
were
so
many
cases
where
people
had
given
up
a
treasure
after
getting
down
within
six
inches
of
it,
and
then
somebody
else
had
come
along
and
turned
it
up
with
a
single
thrust
of
a
shovel.
The
thing
failed
this
time,
however,
so
the
boys
shouldered
their
tools
and
went
away
feeling
that
they
had
not
trifled
with
fortune,
but
had
fulfilled
all
the
requirements
that
belong
to
the
business
of
treasure-hunting.
When
they
reached
the
haunted
house
there
was
something
so
weird
and
grisly
about
the
dead
silence
that
reigned
there
under
the
baking
sun,
and
something
so
depressing
about
the
loneliness
and
desolation
of
the
place,
that
they
were
afraid,
for
a
moment,
to
venture
in.
Then
they
crept
to
the
door
and
took
a
trembling
peep.
They
saw
a
weed-grown,
floorless
room,
unplastered,
an
ancient
fireplace,
vacant
windows,
a
ruinous
staircase;
and
here,
there,
and
everywhere
hung
ragged
and
abandoned
cobwebs.
They
presently
entered,
softly,
with
quickened
pulses,
talking
in
whispers,
ears
alert
to
catch
the
slightest
sound,
and
muscles
tense
and
ready
for
instant
retreat.
In
a
little
while
familiarity
modified
their
fears
and
they
gave
the
place
a
critical
and
interested
examination,
rather
admiring
their
own
boldness,
and
wondering
at
it,
too.
Next
they
wanted
to
look
up-stairs.
This
was
something
like
cutting
off
retreat,
but
they
got
to
daring
each
other,
and
of
course
there
could
be
but
one
result--they
threw
their
tools
into
a
corner
and
made
the
ascent.
Up
there
were
the
same
signs
of
decay.
In
one
corner
they
found
a
closet
that
promised
mystery,
but
the
promise
was
a
fraud--there
was
nothing
in
it.
Their
courage
was
up
now
and
well
in
hand.
They
were
about
to
go
down
and
begin
work
when--
"Sh!"
said
Tom.
"What
is
it?"
whispered
Huck,
blanching
with
fright.
"Sh!...
There!...
Hear
it?"
"Yes!...
Oh,
my!
Let's
run!"
"Keep
still!
Don't
you
budge!
They're
coming
right
toward
the
door."
The
boys
stretched
themselves
upon
the
floor
with
their
eyes
to
knot-holes
in
the
planking,
and
lay
waiting,
in
a
misery
of
fear.
"They've
stopped....
No--coming....
Here
they
are.
Don't
whisper
another
word,
Huck.
My
goodness,
I
wish
I
was
out
of
this!"
Two
men
entered.
Each
boy
said
to
himself:
"There's
the
old
deaf
and
dumb
Spaniard
that's
been
about
town
once
or
twice
lately--never
saw
t'other
man
before."
"T'other"
was
a
ragged,
unkempt
creature,
with
nothing
very
pleasant
in
his
face.
The
Spaniard
was
wrapped
in
a
serape;
he
had
bushy
white
whiskers;
long
white
hair
flowed
from
under
his
sombrero,
and
he
wore
green
goggles.
When
they
came
in,
"t'other"
was
talking
in
a
low
voice;
they
sat
down
on
the
ground,
facing
the
door,
with
their
backs
to
the
wall,
and
the
speaker
continued
his
remarks.
His
manner
became
less
guarded
and
his
words
more
distinct
as
he
proceeded:
"No,"
said
he,
"I've
thought
it
all
over,
and
I
don't
like
it.
It's
dangerous."
"Dangerous!"
grunted
the
"deaf
and
dumb"
Spaniard--to
the
vast
surprise
of
the
boys.
"Milksop!"
This
voice
made
the
boys
gasp
and
quake.
It
was
Injun
Joe's!
There
was
silence
for
some
time.
Then
Joe
said:
"What's
any
more
dangerous
than
that
job
up
yonder--but
nothing's
come
of
it."
"That's
different.
Away
up
the
river
so,
and
not
another
house
about.
'Twon't
ever
be
known
that
we
tried,
anyway,
long
as
we
didn't
succeed."
"Well,
what's
more
dangerous
than
coming
here
in
the
daytime!--anybody
would
suspicion
us
that
saw
us."
"I
know
that.
But
there
warn't
any
other
place
as
handy
after
that
fool
of
a
job.
I
want
to
quit
this
shanty.
I
wanted
to
yesterday,
only
it
warn't
any
use
trying
to
stir
out
of
here,
with
those
infernal
boys
playing
over
there
on
the
hill
right
in
full
view."
"Those
infernal
boys"
quaked
again
under
the
inspiration
of
this
remark,
and
thought
how
lucky
it
was
that
they
had
remembered
it
was
Friday
and
concluded
to
wait
a
day.
They
wished
in
their
hearts
they
had
waited
a
year.
The
two
men
got
out
some
food
and
made
a
luncheon.
After
a
long
and
thoughtful
silence,
Injun
Joe
said:
"Look
here,
lad--you
go
back
up
the
river
where
you
belong.
Wait
there
till
you
hear
from
me.
I'll
take
the
chances
on
dropping
into
this
town
just
once
more,
for
a
look.
We'll
do
that
'dangerous'
job
after
I've
spied
around
a
little
and
think
things
look
well
for
it.
Then
for
Texas!
We'll
leg
it
together!"
This
was
satisfactory.
Both
men
presently
fell
to
yawning,
and
Injun
Joe
said:
"I'm
dead
for
sleep!
It's
your
turn
to
watch."
He
curled
down
in
the
weeds
and
soon
began
to
snore.
His
comrade
stirred
him
once
or
twice
and
he
became
quiet.
Presently
the
watcher
began
to
nod;
his
head
drooped
lower
and
lower,
both
men
began
to
snore
now.
The
boys
drew
a
long,
grateful
breath.
Tom
whispered:
"Now's
our
chance--come!"
Huck
said:
"I
can't--I'd
die
if
they
was
to
wake."
Tom
urged--Huck
held
back.
At
last
Tom
rose
slowly
and
softly,
and
started
alone.
But
the
first
step
he
made
wrung
such
a
hideous
creak
from
the
crazy
floor
that
he
sank
down
almost
dead
with
fright.
He
never
made
a
second
attempt.
The
boys
lay
there
counting
the
dragging
moments
till
it
seemed
to
them
that
time
must
be
done
and
eternity
growing
gray;
and
then
they
were
grateful
to
note
that
at
last
the
sun
was
setting.
Now
one
snore
ceased.
Injun
Joe
sat
up,
stared
around--smiled
grimly
upon
his
comrade,
whose
head
was
drooping
upon
his
knees--stirred
him
up
with
his
foot
and
said:
"Here!
YOU'RE
a
watchman,
ain't
you!
All
right,
though--nothing's
happened."
"My!
have
I
been
asleep?"
"Oh,
partly,
partly.
Nearly
time
for
us
to
be
moving,
pard.
What'll
we
do
with
what
little
swag
we've
got
left?"
"I
don't
know--leave
it
here
as
we've
always
done,
I
reckon.
No
use
to
take
it
away
till
we
start
south.
Six
hundred
and
fifty
in
silver's
something
to
carry."
"Well--all
right--it
won't
matter
to
come
here
once
more."
"No--but
I'd
say
come
in
the
night
as
we
used
to
do--it's
better."
"Yes:
but
look
here;
it
may
be
a
good
while
before
I
get
the
right
chance
at
that
job;
accidents
might
happen;
'tain't
in
such
a
very
good
place;
we'll
just
regularly
bury
it--and
bury
it
deep."
"Good
idea,"
said
the
comrade,
who
walked
across
the
room,
knelt
down,
raised
one
of
the
rearward
hearth-stones
and
took
out
a
bag
that
jingled
pleasantly.
He
subtracted
from
it
twenty
or
thirty
dollars
for
himself
and
as
much
for
Injun
Joe,
and
passed
the
bag
to
the
latter,
who
was
on
his
knees
in
the
corner,
now,
digging
with
his
bowie-knife.
The
boys
forgot
all
their
fears,
all
their
miseries
in
an
instant.
With
gloating
eyes
they
watched
every
movement.
Luck!--the
splendor
of
it
was
beyond
all
imagination!
Six
hundred
dollars
was
money
enough
to
make
half
a
dozen
boys
rich!
Here
was
treasure-hunting
under
the
happiest
auspices--there
would
not
be
any
bothersome
uncertainty
as
to
where
to
dig.
They
nudged
each
other
every
moment--eloquent
nudges
and
easily
understood,
for
they
simply
meant--"Oh,
but
ain't
you
glad
NOW
we're
here!"
Joe's
knife
struck
upon
something.
"Hello!"
said
he.
"What
is
it?"
said
his
comrade.
"Half-rotten
plank--no,
it's
a
box,
I
believe.
Here--bear
a
hand
and
we'll
see
what
it's
here
for.
Never
mind,
I've
broke
a
hole."
He
reached
his
hand
in
and
drew
it
out--
"Man,
it's
money!"
The
two
men
examined
the
handful
of
coins.
They
were
gold.
The
boys
above
were
as
excited
as
themselves,
and
as
delighted.
Joe's
comrade
said:
"We'll
make
quick
work
of
this.
There's
an
old
rusty
pick
over
amongst
the
weeds
in
the
corner
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace--I
saw
it
a
minute
ago."
He
ran
and
brought
the
boys'
pick
and
shovel.
Injun
Joe
took
the
pick,
looked
it
over
critically,
shook
his
head,
muttered
something
to
himself,
and
then
began
to
use
it.
The
box
was
soon
unearthed.
It
was
not
very
large;
it
was
iron
bound
and
had
been
very
strong
before
the
slow
years
had
injured
it.
The
men
contemplated
the
treasure
awhile
in
blissful
silence.
"Pard,
there's
thousands
of
dollars
here,"
said
Injun
Joe.
"'Twas
always
said
that
Murrel's
gang
used
to
be
around
here
one
summer,"
the
stranger
observed.
"I
know
it,"
said
Injun
Joe;
"and
this
looks
like
it,
I
should
say."
"Now
you
won't
need
to
do
that
job."
The
half-breed
frowned.
Said
he:
"You
don't
know
me.
Least
you
don't
know
all
about
that
thing.
'Tain't
robbery
altogether--it's
REVENGE!"
and
a
wicked
light
flamed
in
his
eyes.
"I'll
need
your
help
in
it.
When
it's
finished--then
Texas.
Go
home
to
your
Nance
and
your
kids,
and
stand
by
till
you
hear
from
me."
"Well--if
you
say
so;
what'll
we
do
with
this--bury
it
again?"
"Yes.
[Ravishing
delight
overhead.]
NO!
by
the
great
Sachem,
no!
[Profound
distress
overhead.]
I'd
nearly
forgot.
That
pick
had
fresh
earth
on
it!
[The
boys
were
sick
with
terror
in
a
moment.]
What
business
has
a
pick
and
a
shovel
here?
What
business
with
fresh
earth
on
them?
Who
brought
them
here--and
where
are
they
gone?
Have
you
heard
anybody?--seen
anybody?
What!
bury
it
again
and
leave
them
to
come
and
see
the
ground
disturbed?
Not
exactly--not
exactly.
We'll
take
it
to
my
den."
"Why,
of
course!
Might
have
thought
of
that
before.
You
mean
Number
One?"
"No--Number
Two--under
the
cross.
The
other
place
is
bad--too
common."
"All
right.
It's
nearly
dark
enough
to
start."
Injun
Joe
got
up
and
went
about
from
window
to
window
cautiously
peeping
out.
Presently
he
said:
"Who
could
have
brought
those
tools
here?
Do
you
reckon
they
can
be
up-stairs?"
The
boys'
breath
forsook
them.
Injun
Joe
put
his
hand
on
his
knife,
halted
a
moment,
undecided,
and
then
turned
toward
the
stairway.
The
boys
thought
of
the
closet,
but
their
strength
was
gone.
The
steps
came
creaking
up
the
stairs--the
intolerable
distress
of
the
situation
woke
the
stricken
resolution
of
the
lads--they
were
about
to
spring
for
the
closet,
when
there
was
a
crash
of
rotten
timbers
and
Injun
Joe
landed
on
the
ground
amid
the
debris
of
the
ruined
stairway.
He
gathered
himself
up
cursing,
and
his
comrade
said:
"Now
what's
the
use
of
all
that?
If
it's
anybody,
and
they're
up
there,
let
them
STAY
there--who
cares?
If
they
want
to
jump
down,
now,
and
get
into
trouble,
who
objects?
It
will
be
dark
in
fifteen
minutes
--and
then
let
them
follow
us
if
they
want
to.
I'm
willing.
In
my
opinion,
whoever
hove
those
things
in
here
caught
a
sight
of
us
and
took
us
for
ghosts
or
devils
or
something.
I'll
bet
they're
running
yet."
Joe
grumbled
awhile;
then
he
agreed
with
his
friend
that
what
daylight
was
left
ought
to
be
economized
in
getting
things
ready
for
leaving.
Shortly
afterward
they
slipped
out
of
the
house
in
the
deepening
twilight,
and
moved
toward
the
river
with
their
precious
box.
Tom
and
Huck
rose
up,
weak
but
vastly
relieved,
and
stared
after
them
through
the
chinks
between
the
logs
of
the
house.
Follow?
Not
they.
They
were
content
to
reach
ground
again
without
broken
necks,
and
take
the
townward
track
over
the
hill.
They
did
not
talk
much.
They
were
too
much
absorbed
in
hating
themselves--hating
the
ill
luck
that
made
them
take
the
spade
and
the
pick
there.
But
for
that,
Injun
Joe
never
would
have
suspected.
He
would
have
hidden
the
silver
with
the
gold
to
wait
there
till
his
"revenge"
was
satisfied,
and
then
he
would
have
had
the
misfortune
to
find
that
money
turn
up
missing.
Bitter,
bitter
luck
that
the
tools
were
ever
brought
there!
They
resolved
to
keep
a
lookout
for
that
Spaniard
when
he
should
come
to
town
spying
out
for
chances
to
do
his
revengeful
job,
and
follow
him
to
"Number
Two,"
wherever
that
might
be.
Then
a
ghastly
thought
occurred
to
Tom.
"Revenge?
What
if
he
means
US,
Huck!"
"Oh,
don't!"
said
Huck,
nearly
fainting.
They
talked
it
all
over,
and
as
they
entered
town
they
agreed
to
believe
that
he
might
possibly
mean
somebody
else--at
least
that
he
might
at
least
mean
nobody
but
Tom,
since
only
Tom
had
testified.
Very,
very
small
comfort
it
was
to
Tom
to
be
alone
in
danger!
Company
would
be
a
palpable
improvement,
he
thought.
CHAPTER
XXVII
THE
adventure
of
the
day
mightily
tormented
Tom's
dreams
that
night.
Four
times
he
had
his
hands
on
that
rich
treasure
and
four
times
it
wasted
to
nothingness
in
his
fingers
as
sleep
forsook
him
and
wakefulness
brought
back
the
hard
reality
of
his
misfortune.
As
he
lay
in
the
early
morning
recalling
the
incidents
of
his
great
adventure,
he
noticed
that
they
seemed
curiously
subdued
and
far
away--somewhat
as
if
they
had
happened
in
another
world,
or
in
a
time
long
gone
by.
Then
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
great
adventure
itself
must
be
a
dream!
There
was
one
very
strong
argument
in
favor
of
this
idea--namely,
that
the
quantity
of
coin
he
had
seen
was
too
vast
to
be
real.
He
had
never
seen
as
much
as
fifty
dollars
in
one
mass
before,
and
he
was
like
all
boys
of
his
age
and
station
in
life,
in
that
he
imagined
that
all
references
to
"hundreds"
and
"thousands"
were
mere
fanciful
forms
of
speech,
and
that
no
such
sums
really
existed
in
the
world.
He
never
had
supposed
for
a
moment
that
so
large
a
sum
as
a
hundred
dollars
was
to
be
found
in
actual
money
in
any
one's
possession.
If
his
notions
of
hidden
treasure
had
been
analyzed,
they
would
have
been
found
to
consist
of
a
handful
of
real
dimes
and
a
bushel
of
vague,
splendid,
ungraspable
dollars.
But
the
incidents
of
his
adventure
grew
sensibly
sharper
and
clearer
under
the
attrition
of
thinking
them
over,
and
so
he
presently
found
himself
leaning
to
the
impression
that
the
thing
might
not
have
been
a
dream,
after
all.
This
uncertainty
must
be
swept
away.
He
would
snatch
a
hurried
breakfast
and
go
and
find
Huck.
Huck
was
sitting
on
the
gunwale
of
a
flatboat,
listlessly
dangling
his
feet
in
the
water
and
looking
very
melancholy.
Tom
concluded
to
let
Huck
lead
up
to
the
subject.
If
he
did
not
do
it,
then
the
adventure
would
be
proved
to
have
been
only
a
dream.
"Hello,
Huck!"
"Hello,
yourself."
Silence,
for
a
minute.
"Tom,
if
we'd
'a'
left
the
blame
tools
at
the
dead
tree,
we'd
'a'
got
the
money.
Oh,
ain't
it
awful!"
"'Tain't
a
dream,
then,
'tain't
a
dream!
Somehow
I
most
wish
it
was.
Dog'd
if
I
don't,
Huck."
"What
ain't
a
dream?"
"Oh,
that
thing
yesterday.
I
been
half
thinking
it
was."
"Dream!
If
them
stairs
hadn't
broke
down
you'd
'a'
seen
how
much
dream
it
was!
I've
had
dreams
enough
all
night--with
that
patch-eyed
Spanish
devil
going
for
me
all
through
'em--rot
him!"
"No,
not
rot
him.
FIND
him!
Track
the
money!"
"Tom,
we'll
never
find
him.
A
feller
don't
have
only
one
chance
for
such
a
pile--and
that
one's
lost.
I'd
feel
mighty
shaky
if
I
was
to
see
him,
anyway."
"Well,
so'd
I;
but
I'd
like
to
see
him,
anyway--and
track
him
out--to
his
Number
Two."
"Number
Two--yes,
that's
it.
I
been
thinking
'bout
that.
But
I
can't
make
nothing
out
of
it.
What
do
you
reckon
it
is?"
"I
dono.
It's
too
deep.
Say,
Huck--maybe
it's
the
number
of
a
house!"
"Goody!...
No,
Tom,
that
ain't
it.
If
it
is,
it
ain't
in
this
one-horse
town.
They
ain't
no
numbers
here."
"Well,
that's
so.
Lemme
think
a
minute.
Here--it's
the
number
of
a
room--in
a
tavern,
you
know!"
"Oh,
that's
the
trick!
They
ain't
only
two
taverns.
We
can
find
out
quick."
"You
stay
here,
Huck,
till
I
come."
Tom
was
off
at
once.
He
did
not
care
to
have
Huck's
company
in
public
places.
He
was
gone
half
an
hour.
He
found
that
in
the
best
tavern,
No.
2
had
long
been
occupied
by
a
young
lawyer,
and
was
still
so
occupied.
In
the
less
ostentatious
house,
No.
2
was
a
mystery.
The
tavern-keeper's
young
son
said
it
was
kept
locked
all
the
time,
and
he
never
saw
anybody
go
into
it
or
come
out
of
it
except
at
night;
he
did
not
know
any
particular
reason
for
this
state
of
things;
had
had
some
little
curiosity,
but
it
was
rather
feeble;
had
made
the
most
of
the
mystery
by
entertaining
himself
with
the
idea
that
that
room
was
"ha'nted";
had
noticed
that
there
was
a
light
in
there
the
night
before.
"That's
what
I've
found
out,
Huck.
I
reckon
that's
the
very
No.
2
we're
after."
"I
reckon
it
is,
Tom.
Now
what
you
going
to
do?"
"Lemme
think."
Tom
thought
a
long
time.
Then
he
said:
"I'll
tell
you.
The
back
door
of
that
No.
2
is
the
door
that
comes
out
into
that
little
close
alley
between
the
tavern
and
the
old
rattle
trap
of
a
brick
store.
Now
you
get
hold
of
all
the
door-keys
you
can
find,
and
I'll
nip
all
of
auntie's,
and
the
first
dark
night
we'll
go
there
and
try
'em.
And
mind
you,
keep
a
lookout
for
Injun
Joe,
because
he
said
he
was
going
to
drop
into
town
and
spy
around
once
more
for
a
chance
to
get
his
revenge.
If
you
see
him,
you
just
follow
him;
and
if
he
don't
go
to
that
No.
2,
that
ain't
the
place."
"Lordy,
I
don't
want
to
foller
him
by
myself!"
"Why,
it'll
be
night,
sure.
He
mightn't
ever
see
you--and
if
he
did,
maybe
he'd
never
think
anything."
"Well,
if
it's
pretty
dark
I
reckon
I'll
track
him.
I
dono--I
dono.
I'll
try."
"You
bet
I'll
follow
him,
if
it's
dark,
Huck.
Why,
he
might
'a'
found
out
he
couldn't
get
his
revenge,
and
be
going
right
after
that
money."
"It's
so,
Tom,
it's
so.
I'll
foller
him;
I
will,
by
jingoes!"
"Now
you're
TALKING!
Don't
you
ever
weaken,
Huck,
and
I
won't."
CHAPTER
XXVIII
THAT
night
Tom
and
Huck
were
ready
for
their
adventure.
They
hung
about
the
neighborhood
of
the
tavern
until
after
nine,
one
watching
the
alley
at
a
distance
and
the
other
the
tavern
door.
Nobody
entered
the
alley
or
left
it;
nobody
resembling
the
Spaniard
entered
or
left
the
tavern
door.
The
night
promised
to
be
a
fair
one;
so
Tom
went
home
with
the
understanding
that
if
a
considerable
degree
of
darkness
came
on,
Huck
was
to
come
and
"maow,"
whereupon
he
would
slip
out
and
try
the
keys.
But
the
night
remained
clear,
and
Huck
closed
his
watch
and
retired
to
bed
in
an
empty
sugar
hogshead
about
twelve.
Tuesday
the
boys
had
the
same
ill
luck.
Also
Wednesday.
But
Thursday
night
promised
better.
Tom
slipped
out
in
good
season
with
his
aunt's
old
tin
lantern,
and
a
large
towel
to
blindfold
it
with.
He
hid
the
lantern
in
Huck's
sugar
hogshead
and
the
watch
began.
An
hour
before
midnight
the
tavern
closed
up
and
its
lights
(the
only
ones
thereabouts)
were
put
out.
No
Spaniard
had
been
seen.
Nobody
had
entered
or
left
the
alley.
Everything
was
auspicious.
The
blackness
of
darkness
reigned,
the
perfect
stillness
was
interrupted
only
by
occasional
mutterings
of
distant
thunder.
Tom
got
his
lantern,
lit
it
in
the
hogshead,
wrapped
it
closely
in
the
towel,
and
the
two
adventurers
crept
in
the
gloom
toward
the
tavern.
Huck
stood
sentry
and
Tom
felt
his
way
into
the
alley.
Then
there
was
a
season
of
waiting
anxiety
that
weighed
upon
Huck's
spirits
like
a
mountain.
He
began
to
wish
he
could
see
a
flash
from
the
lantern--it
would
frighten
him,
but
it
would
at
least
tell
him
that
Tom
was
alive
yet.
It
seemed
hours
since
Tom
had
disappeared.
Surely
he
must
have
fainted;
maybe
he
was
dead;
maybe
his
heart
had
burst
under
terror
and
excitement.
In
his
uneasiness
Huck
found
himself
drawing
closer
and
closer
to
the
alley;
fearing
all
sorts
of
dreadful
things,
and
momentarily
expecting
some
catastrophe
to
happen
that
would
take
away
his
breath.
There
was
not
much
to
take
away,
for
he
seemed
only
able
to
inhale
it
by
thimblefuls,
and
his
heart
would
soon
wear
itself
out,
the
way
it
was
beating.
Suddenly
there
was
a
flash
of
light
and
Tom
came
tearing
by
him:
"Run!"
said
he;
"run,
for
your
life!"
He
needn't
have
repeated
it;
once
was
enough;
Huck
was
making
thirty
or
forty
miles
an
hour
before
the
repetition
was
uttered.
The
boys
never
stopped
till
they
reached
the
shed
of
a
deserted
slaughter-house
at
the
lower
end
of
the
village.
Just
as
they
got
within
its
shelter
the
storm
burst
and
the
rain
poured
down.
As
soon
as
Tom
got
his
breath
he
said:
"Huck,
it
was
awful!
I
tried
two
of
the
keys,
just
as
soft
as
I
could;
but
they
seemed
to
make
such
a
power
of
racket
that
I
couldn't
hardly
get
my
breath
I
was
so
scared.
They
wouldn't
turn
in
the
lock,
either.
Well,
without
noticing
what
I
was
doing,
I
took
hold
of
the
knob,
and
open
comes
the
door!
It
warn't
locked!
I
hopped
in,
and
shook
off
the
towel,
and,
GREAT
CAESAR'S
GHOST!"
"What!--what'd
you
see,
Tom?"
"Huck,
I
most
stepped
onto
Injun
Joe's
hand!"
"No!"
"Yes!
He
was
lying
there,
sound
asleep
on
the
floor,
with
his
old
patch
on
his
eye
and
his
arms
spread
out."
"Lordy,
what
did
you
do?
Did
he
wake
up?"
"No,
never
budged.
Drunk,
I
reckon.
I
just
grabbed
that
towel
and
started!"
"I'd
never
'a'
thought
of
the
towel,
I
bet!"
"Well,
I
would.
My
aunt
would
make
me
mighty
sick
if
I
lost
it."
"Say,
Tom,
did
you
see
that
box?"
"Huck,
I
didn't
wait
to
look
around.
I
didn't
see
the
box,
I
didn't
see
the
cross.
I
didn't
see
anything
but
a
bottle
and
a
tin
cup
on
the
floor
by
Injun
Joe;
yes,
I
saw
two
barrels
and
lots
more
bottles
in
the
room.
Don't
you
see,
now,
what's
the
matter
with
that
ha'nted
room?"
"How?"
"Why,
it's
ha'nted
with
whiskey!
Maybe
ALL
the
Temperance
Taverns
have
got
a
ha'nted
room,
hey,
Huck?"
"Well,
I
reckon
maybe
that's
so.
Who'd
'a'
thought
such
a
thing?
But
say,
Tom,
now's
a
mighty
good
time
to
get
that
box,
if
Injun
Joe's
drunk."
"It
is,
that!
You
try
it!"
Huck
shuddered.
"Well,
no--I
reckon
not."
"And
I
reckon
not,
Huck.
Only
one
bottle
alongside
of
Injun
Joe
ain't
enough.
If
there'd
been
three,
he'd
be
drunk
enough
and
I'd
do
it."
There
was
a
long
pause
for
reflection,
and
then
Tom
said:
"Lookyhere,
Huck,
less
not
try
that
thing
any
more
till
we
know
Injun
Joe's
not
in
there.
It's
too
scary.
Now,
if
we
watch
every
night,
we'll
be
dead
sure
to
see
him
go
out,
some
time
or
other,
and
then
we'll
snatch
that
box
quicker'n
lightning."
"Well,
I'm
agreed.
I'll
watch
the
whole
night
long,
and
I'll
do
it
every
night,
too,
if
you'll
do
the
other
part
of
the
job."
"All
right,
I
will.
All
you
got
to
do
is
to
trot
up
Hooper
Street
a
block
and
maow--and
if
I'm
asleep,
you
throw
some
gravel
at
the
window
and
that'll
fetch
me."
"Agreed,
and
good
as
wheat!"
"Now,
Huck,
the
storm's
over,
and
I'll
go
home.
It'll
begin
to
be
daylight
in
a
couple
of
hours.
You
go
back
and
watch
that
long,
will
you?"
"I
said
I
would,
Tom,
and
I
will.
I'll
ha'nt
that
tavern
every
night
for
a
year!
I'll
sleep
all
day
and
I'll
stand
watch
all
night."
"That's
all
right.
Now,
where
you
going
to
sleep?"
"In
Ben
Rogers'
hayloft.
He
lets
me,
and
so
does
his
pap's
nigger
man,
Uncle
Jake.
I
tote
water
for
Uncle
Jake
whenever
he
wants
me
to,
and
any
time
I
ask
him
he
gives
me
a
little
something
to
eat
if
he
can
spare
it.
That's
a
mighty
good
nigger,
Tom.
He
likes
me,
becuz
I
don't
ever
act
as
if
I
was
above
him.
Sometime
I've
set
right
down
and
eat
WITH
him.
But
you
needn't
tell
that.
A
body's
got
to
do
things
when
he's
awful
hungry
he
wouldn't
want
to
do
as
a
steady
thing."
"Well,
if
I
don't
want
you
in
the
daytime,
I'll
let
you
sleep.
I
won't
come
bothering
around.
Any
time
you
see
something's
up,
in
the
night,
just
skip
right
around
and
maow."
CHAPTER
XXIX
THE
first
thing
Tom
heard
on
Friday
morning
was
a
glad
piece
of
news
--Judge
Thatcher's
family
had
come
back
to
town
the
night
before.
Both
Injun
Joe
and
the
treasure
sunk
into
secondary
importance
for
a
moment,
and
Becky
took
the
chief
place
in
the
boy's
interest.
He
saw
her
and
they
had
an
exhausting
good
time
playing
"hi-spy"
and
"gully-keeper"
with
a
crowd
of
their
school-mates.
The
day
was
completed
and
crowned
in
a
peculiarly
satisfactory
way:
Becky
teased
her
mother
to
appoint
the
next
day
for
the
long-promised
and
long-delayed
picnic,
and
she
consented.
The
child's
delight
was
boundless;
and
Tom's
not
more
moderate.
The
invitations
were
sent
out
before
sunset,
and
straightway
the
young
folks
of
the
village
were
thrown
into
a
fever
of
preparation
and
pleasurable
anticipation.
Tom's
excitement
enabled
him
to
keep
awake
until
a
pretty
late
hour,
and
he
had
good
hopes
of
hearing
Huck's
"maow,"
and
of
having
his
treasure
to
astonish
Becky
and
the
picnickers
with,
next
day;
but
he
was
disappointed.
No
signal
came
that
night.
Morning
came,
eventually,
and
by
ten
or
eleven
o'clock
a
giddy
and
rollicking
company
were
gathered
at
Judge
Thatcher's,
and
everything
was
ready
for
a
start.
It
was
not
the
custom
for
elderly
people
to
mar
the
picnics
with
their
presence.
The
children
were
considered
safe
enough
under
the
wings
of
a
few
young
ladies
of
eighteen
and
a
few
young
gentlemen
of
twenty-three
or
thereabouts.
The
old
steam
ferryboat
was
chartered
for
the
occasion;
presently
the
gay
throng
filed
up
the
main
street
laden
with
provision-baskets.
Sid
was
sick
and
had
to
miss
the
fun;
Mary
remained
at
home
to
entertain
him.
The
last
thing
Mrs.
Thatcher
said
to
Becky,
was:
"You'll
not
get
back
till
late.
Perhaps
you'd
better
stay
all
night
with
some
of
the
girls
that
live
near
the
ferry-landing,
child."
"Then
I'll
stay
with
Susy
Harper,
mamma."
"Very
well.
And
mind
and
behave
yourself
and
don't
be
any
trouble."
Presently,
as
they
tripped
along,
Tom
said
to
Becky:
"Say--I'll
tell
you
what
we'll
do.
'Stead
of
going
to
Joe
Harper's
we'll
climb
right
up
the
hill
and
stop
at
the
Widow
Douglas'.
She'll
have
ice-cream!
She
has
it
most
every
day--dead
loads
of
it.
And
she'll
be
awful
glad
to
have
us."
"Oh,
that
will
be
fun!"
Then
Becky
reflected
a
moment
and
said:
"But
what
will
mamma
say?"
"How'll
she
ever
know?"
The
girl
turned
the
idea
over
in
her
mind,
and
said
reluctantly:
"I
reckon
it's
wrong--but--"
"But
shucks!
Your
mother
won't
know,
and
so
what's
the
harm?
All
she
wants
is
that
you'll
be
safe;
and
I
bet
you
she'd
'a'
said
go
there
if
she'd
'a'
thought
of
it.
I
know
she
would!"
The
Widow
Douglas'
splendid
hospitality
was
a
tempting
bait.
It
and
Tom's
persuasions
presently
carried
the
day.
So
it
was
decided
to
say
nothing
anybody
about
the
night's
programme.
Presently
it
occurred
to
Tom
that
maybe
Huck
might
come
this
very
night
and
give
the
signal.
The
thought
took
a
deal
of
the
spirit
out
of
his
anticipations.
Still
he
could
not
bear
to
give
up
the
fun
at
Widow
Douglas'.
And
why
should
he
give
it
up,
he
reasoned--the
signal
did
not
come
the
night
before,
so
why
should
it
be
any
more
likely
to
come
to-night?
The
sure
fun
of
the
evening
outweighed
the
uncertain
treasure;
and,
boy-like,
he
determined
to
yield
to
the
stronger
inclination
and
not
allow
himself
to
think
of
the
box
of
money
another
time
that
day.
Three
miles
below
town
the
ferryboat
stopped
at
the
mouth
of
a
woody
hollow
and
tied
up.
The
crowd
swarmed
ashore
and
soon
the
forest
distances
and
craggy
heights
echoed
far
and
near
with
shoutings
and
laughter.
All
the
different
ways
of
getting
hot
and
tired
were
gone
through
with,
and
by-and-by
the
rovers
straggled
back
to
camp
fortified
with
responsible
appetites,
and
then
the
destruction
of
the
good
things
began.
After
the
feast
there
was
a
refreshing
season
of
rest
and
chat
in
the
shade
of
spreading
oaks.
By-and-by
somebody
shouted:
"Who's
ready
for
the
cave?"
Everybody
was.
Bundles
of
candles
were
procured,
and
straightway
there
was
a
general
scamper
up
the
hill.
The
mouth
of
the
cave
was
up
the
hillside--an
opening
shaped
like
a
letter
A.
Its
massive
oaken
door
stood
unbarred.
Within
was
a
small
chamber,
chilly
as
an
ice-house,
and
walled
by
Nature
with
solid
limestone
that
was
dewy
with
a
cold
sweat.
It
was
romantic
and
mysterious
to
stand
here
in
the
deep
gloom
and
look
out
upon
the
green
valley
shining
in
the
sun.
But
the
impressiveness
of
the
situation
quickly
wore
off,
and
the
romping
began
again.
The
moment
a
candle
was
lighted
there
was
a
general
rush
upon
the
owner
of
it;
a
struggle
and
a
gallant
defence
followed,
but
the
candle
was
soon
knocked
down
or
blown
out,
and
then
there
was
a
glad
clamor
of
laughter
and
a
new
chase.
But
all
things
have
an
end.
By-and-by
the
procession
went
filing
down
the
steep
descent
of
the
main
avenue,
the
flickering
rank
of
lights
dimly
revealing
the
lofty
walls
of
rock
almost
to
their
point
of
junction
sixty
feet
overhead.
This
main
avenue
was
not
more
than
eight
or
ten
feet
wide.
Every
few
steps
other
lofty
and
still
narrower
crevices
branched
from
it
on
either
hand--for
McDougal's
cave
was
but
a
vast
labyrinth
of
crooked
aisles
that
ran
into
each
other
and
out
again
and
led
nowhere.
It
was
said
that
one
might
wander
days
and
nights
together
through
its
intricate
tangle
of
rifts
and
chasms,
and
never
find
the
end
of
the
cave;
and
that
he
might
go
down,
and
down,
and
still
down,
into
the
earth,
and
it
was
just
the
same--labyrinth
under
labyrinth,
and
no
end
to
any
of
them.
No
man
"knew"
the
cave.
That
was
an
impossible
thing.
Most
of
the
young
men
knew
a
portion
of
it,
and
it
was
not
customary
to
venture
much
beyond
this
known
portion.
Tom
Sawyer
knew
as
much
of
the
cave
as
any
one.
The
procession
moved
along
the
main
avenue
some
three-quarters
of
a
mile,
and
then
groups
and
couples
began
to
slip
aside
into
branch
avenues,
fly
along
the
dismal
corridors,
and
take
each
other
by
surprise
at
points
where
the
corridors
joined
again.
Parties
were
able
to
elude
each
other
for
the
space
of
half
an
hour
without
going
beyond
the
"known"
ground.
By-and-by,
one
group
after
another
came
straggling
back
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave,
panting,
hilarious,
smeared
from
head
to
foot
with
tallow
drippings,
daubed
with
clay,
and
entirely
delighted
with
the
success
of
the
day.
Then
they
were
astonished
to
find
that
they
had
been
taking
no
note
of
time
and
that
night
was
about
at
hand.
The
clanging
bell
had
been
calling
for
half
an
hour.
However,
this
sort
of
close
to
the
day's
adventures
was
romantic
and
therefore
satisfactory.
When
the
ferryboat
with
her
wild
freight
pushed
into
the
stream,
nobody
cared
sixpence
for
the
wasted
time
but
the
captain
of
the
craft.
Huck
was
already
upon
his
watch
when
the
ferryboat's
lights
went
glinting
past
the
wharf.
He
heard
no
noise
on
board,
for
the
young
people
were
as
subdued
and
still
as
people
usually
are
who
are
nearly
tired
to
death.
He
wondered
what
boat
it
was,
and
why
she
did
not
stop
at
the
wharf--and
then
he
dropped
her
out
of
his
mind
and
put
his
attention
upon
his
business.
The
night
was
growing
cloudy
and
dark.
Ten
o'clock
came,
and
the
noise
of
vehicles
ceased,
scattered
lights
began
to
wink
out,
all
straggling
foot-passengers
disappeared,
the
village
betook
itself
to
its
slumbers
and
left
the
small
watcher
alone
with
the
silence
and
the
ghosts.
Eleven
o'clock
came,
and
the
tavern
lights
were
put
out;
darkness
everywhere,
now.
Huck
waited
what
seemed
a
weary
long
time,
but
nothing
happened.
His
faith
was
weakening.
Was
there
any
use?
Was
there
really
any
use?
Why
not
give
it
up
and
turn
in?
A
noise
fell
upon
his
ear.
He
was
all
attention
in
an
instant.
The
alley
door
closed
softly.
He
sprang
to
the
corner
of
the
brick
store.
The
next
moment
two
men
brushed
by
him,
and
one
seemed
to
have
something
under
his
arm.
It
must
be
that
box!
So
they
were
going
to
remove
the
treasure.
Why
call
Tom
now?
It
would
be
absurd--the
men
would
get
away
with
the
box
and
never
be
found
again.
No,
he
would
stick
to
their
wake
and
follow
them;
he
would
trust
to
the
darkness
for
security
from
discovery.
So
communing
with
himself,
Huck
stepped
out
and
glided
along
behind
the
men,
cat-like,
with
bare
feet,
allowing
them
to
keep
just
far
enough
ahead
not
to
be
invisible.
They
moved
up
the
river
street
three
blocks,
then
turned
to
the
left
up
a
cross-street.
They
went
straight
ahead,
then,
until
they
came
to
the
path
that
led
up
Cardiff
Hill;
this
they
took.
They
passed
by
the
old
Welshman's
house,
half-way
up
the
hill,
without
hesitating,
and
still
climbed
upward.
Good,
thought
Huck,
they
will
bury
it
in
the
old
quarry.
But
they
never
stopped
at
the
quarry.
They
passed
on,
up
the
summit.
They
plunged
into
the
narrow
path
between
the
tall
sumach
bushes,
and
were
at
once
hidden
in
the
gloom.
Huck
closed
up
and
shortened
his
distance,
now,
for
they
would
never
be
able
to
see
him.
He
trotted
along
awhile;
then
slackened
his
pace,
fearing
he
was
gaining
too
fast;
moved
on
a
piece,
then
stopped
altogether;
listened;
no
sound;
none,
save
that
he
seemed
to
hear
the
beating
of
his
own
heart.
The
hooting
of
an
owl
came
over
the
hill--ominous
sound!
But
no
footsteps.
Heavens,
was
everything
lost!
He
was
about
to
spring
with
winged
feet,
when
a
man
cleared
his
throat
not
four
feet
from
him!
Huck's
heart
shot
into
his
throat,
but
he
swallowed
it
again;
and
then
he
stood
there
shaking
as
if
a
dozen
agues
had
taken
charge
of
him
at
once,
and
so
weak
that
he
thought
he
must
surely
fall
to
the
ground.
He
knew
where
he
was.
He
knew
he
was
within
five
steps
of
the
stile
leading
into
Widow
Douglas'
grounds.
Very
well,
he
thought,
let
them
bury
it
there;
it
won't
be
hard
to
find.
Now
there
was
a
voice--a
very
low
voice--Injun
Joe's:
"Damn
her,
maybe
she's
got
company--there's
lights,
late
as
it
is."
"I
can't
see
any."
This
was
that
stranger's
voice--the
stranger
of
the
haunted
house.
A
deadly
chill
went
to
Huck's
heart--this,
then,
was
the
"revenge"
job!
His
thought
was,
to
fly.
Then
he
remembered
that
the
Widow
Douglas
had
been
kind
to
him
more
than
once,
and
maybe
these
men
were
going
to
murder
her.
He
wished
he
dared
venture
to
warn
her;
but
he
knew
he
didn't
dare--they
might
come
and
catch
him.
He
thought
all
this
and
more
in
the
moment
that
elapsed
between
the
stranger's
remark
and
Injun
Joe's
next--which
was--
"Because
the
bush
is
in
your
way.
Now--this
way--now
you
see,
don't
you?"
"Yes.
Well,
there
IS
company
there,
I
reckon.
Better
give
it
up."
"Give
it
up,
and
I
just
leaving
this
country
forever!
Give
it
up
and
maybe
never
have
another
chance.
I
tell
you
again,
as
I've
told
you
before,
I
don't
care
for
her
swag--you
may
have
it.
But
her
husband
was
rough
on
me--many
times
he
was
rough
on
me--and
mainly
he
was
the
justice
of
the
peace
that
jugged
me
for
a
vagrant.
And
that
ain't
all.
It
ain't
a
millionth
part
of
it!
He
had
me
HORSEWHIPPED!--horsewhipped
in
front
of
the
jail,
like
a
nigger!--with
all
the
town
looking
on!
HORSEWHIPPED!--do
you
understand?
He
took
advantage
of
me
and
died.
But
I'll
take
it
out
of
HER."
"Oh,
don't
kill
her!
Don't
do
that!"
"Kill?
Who
said
anything
about
killing?
I
would
kill
HIM
if
he
was
here;
but
not
her.
When
you
want
to
get
revenge
on
a
woman
you
don't
kill
her--bosh!
you
go
for
her
looks.
You
slit
her
nostrils--you
notch
her
ears
like
a
sow!"
"By
God,
that's--"
"Keep
your
opinion
to
yourself!
It
will
be
safest
for
you.
I'll
tie
her
to
the
bed.
If
she
bleeds
to
death,
is
that
my
fault?
I'll
not
cry,
if
she
does.
My
friend,
you'll
help
me
in
this
thing--for
MY
sake
--that's
why
you're
here--I
mightn't
be
able
alone.
If
you
flinch,
I'll
kill
you.
Do
you
understand
that?
And
if
I
have
to
kill
you,
I'll
kill
her--and
then
I
reckon
nobody'll
ever
know
much
about
who
done
this
business."
"Well,
if
it's
got
to
be
done,
let's
get
at
it.
The
quicker
the
better--I'm
all
in
a
shiver."
"Do
it
NOW?
And
company
there?
Look
here--I'll
get
suspicious
of
you,
first
thing
you
know.
No--we'll
wait
till
the
lights
are
out--there's
no
hurry."
Huck
felt
that
a
silence
was
going
to
ensue--a
thing
still
more
awful
than
any
amount
of
murderous
talk;
so
he
held
his
breath
and
stepped
gingerly
back;
planted
his
foot
carefully
and
firmly,
after
balancing,
one-legged,
in
a
precarious
way
and
almost
toppling
over,
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other.
He
took
another
step
back,
with
the
same
elaboration
and
the
same
risks;
then
another
and
another,
and--a
twig
snapped
under
his
foot!
His
breath
stopped
and
he
listened.
There
was
no
sound--the
stillness
was
perfect.
His
gratitude
was
measureless.
Now
he
turned
in
his
tracks,
between
the
walls
of
sumach
bushes--turned
himself
as
carefully
as
if
he
were
a
ship--and
then
stepped
quickly
but
cautiously
along.
When
he
emerged
at
the
quarry
he
felt
secure,
and
so
he
picked
up
his
nimble
heels
and
flew.
Down,
down
he
sped,
till
he
reached
the
Welshman's.
He
banged
at
the
door,
and
presently
the
heads
of
the
old
man
and
his
two
stalwart
sons
were
thrust
from
windows.
"What's
the
row
there?
Who's
banging?
What
do
you
want?"
"Let
me
in--quick!
I'll
tell
everything."
"Why,
who
are
you?"
"Huckleberry
Finn--quick,
let
me
in!"
"Huckleberry
Finn,
indeed!
It
ain't
a
name
to
open
many
doors,
I
judge!
But
let
him
in,
lads,
and
let's
see
what's
the
trouble."
"Please
don't
ever
tell
I
told
you,"
were
Huck's
first
words
when
he
got
in.
"Please
don't--I'd
be
killed,
sure--but
the
widow's
been
good
friends
to
me
sometimes,
and
I
want
to
tell--I
WILL
tell
if
you'll
promise
you
won't
ever
say
it
was
me."
"By
George,
he
HAS
got
something
to
tell,
or
he
wouldn't
act
so!"
exclaimed
the
old
man;
"out
with
it
and
nobody
here'll
ever
tell,
lad."
Three
minutes
later
the
old
man
and
his
sons,
well
armed,
were
up
the
hill,
and
just
entering
the
sumach
path
on
tiptoe,
their
weapons
in
their
hands.
Huck
accompanied
them
no
further.
He
hid
behind
a
great
bowlder
and
fell
to
listening.
There
was
a
lagging,
anxious
silence,
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
an
explosion
of
firearms
and
a
cry.
Huck
waited
for
no
particulars.
He
sprang
away
and
sped
down
the
hill
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him.
CHAPTER
XXX
AS
the
earliest
suspicion
of
dawn
appeared
on
Sunday
morning,
Huck
came
groping
up
the
hill
and
rapped
gently
at
the
old
Welshman's
door.
The
inmates
were
asleep,
but
it
was
a
sleep
that
was
set
on
a
hair-trigger,
on
account
of
the
exciting
episode
of
the
night.
A
call
came
from
a
window:
"Who's
there!"
Huck's
scared
voice
answered
in
a
low
tone:
"Please
let
me
in!
It's
only
Huck
Finn!"
"It's
a
name
that
can
open
this
door
night
or
day,
lad!--and
welcome!"
These
were
strange
words
to
the
vagabond
boy's
ears,
and
the
pleasantest
he
had
ever
heard.
He
could
not
recollect
that
the
closing
word
had
ever
been
applied
in
his
case
before.
The
door
was
quickly
unlocked,
and
he
entered.
Huck
was
given
a
seat
and
the
old
man
and
his
brace
of
tall
sons
speedily
dressed
themselves.
"Now,
my
boy,
I
hope
you're
good
and
hungry,
because
breakfast
will
be
ready
as
soon
as
the
sun's
up,
and
we'll
have
a
piping
hot
one,
too
--make
yourself
easy
about
that!
I
and
the
boys
hoped
you'd
turn
up
and
stop
here
last
night."
"I
was
awful
scared,"
said
Huck,
"and
I
run.
I
took
out
when
the
pistols
went
off,
and
I
didn't
stop
for
three
mile.
I've
come
now
becuz
I
wanted
to
know
about
it,
you
know;
and
I
come
before
daylight
becuz
I
didn't
want
to
run
across
them
devils,
even
if
they
was
dead."
"Well,
poor
chap,
you
do
look
as
if
you'd
had
a
hard
night
of
it--but
there's
a
bed
here
for
you
when
you've
had
your
breakfast.
No,
they
ain't
dead,
lad--we
are
sorry
enough
for
that.
You
see
we
knew
right
where
to
put
our
hands
on
them,
by
your
description;
so
we
crept
along
on
tiptoe
till
we
got
within
fifteen
feet
of
them--dark
as
a
cellar
that
sumach
path
was--and
just
then
I
found
I
was
going
to
sneeze.
It
was
the
meanest
kind
of
luck!
I
tried
to
keep
it
back,
but
no
use
--'twas
bound
to
come,
and
it
did
come!
I
was
in
the
lead
with
my
pistol
raised,
and
when
the
sneeze
started
those
scoundrels
a-rustling
to
get
out
of
the
path,
I
sung
out,
'Fire
boys!'
and
blazed
away
at
the
place
where
the
rustling
was.
So
did
the
boys.
But
they
were
off
in
a
jiffy,
those
villains,
and
we
after
them,
down
through
the
woods.
I
judge
we
never
touched
them.
They
fired
a
shot
apiece
as
they
started,
but
their
bullets
whizzed
by
and
didn't
do
us
any
harm.
As
soon
as
we
lost
the
sound
of
their
feet
we
quit
chasing,
and
went
down
and
stirred
up
the
constables.
They
got
a
posse
together,
and
went
off
to
guard
the
river
bank,
and
as
soon
as
it
is
light
the
sheriff
and
a
gang
are
going
to
beat
up
the
woods.
My
boys
will
be
with
them
presently.
I
wish
we
had
some
sort
of
description
of
those
rascals--'twould
help
a
good
deal.
But
you
couldn't
see
what
they
were
like,
in
the
dark,
lad,
I
suppose?"
"Oh
yes;
I
saw
them
down-town
and
follered
them."
"Splendid!
Describe
them--describe
them,
my
boy!"
"One's
the
old
deaf
and
dumb
Spaniard
that's
ben
around
here
once
or
twice,
and
t'other's
a
mean-looking,
ragged--"
"That's
enough,
lad,
we
know
the
men!
Happened
on
them
in
the
woods
back
of
the
widow's
one
day,
and
they
slunk
away.
Off
with
you,
boys,
and
tell
the
sheriff--get
your
breakfast
to-morrow
morning!"
The
Welshman's
sons
departed
at
once.
As
they
were
leaving
the
room
Huck
sprang
up
and
exclaimed:
"Oh,
please
don't
tell
ANYbody
it
was
me
that
blowed
on
them!
Oh,
please!"
"All
right
if
you
say
it,
Huck,
but
you
ought
to
have
the
credit
of
what
you
did."
"Oh
no,
no!
Please
don't
tell!"
When
the
young
men
were
gone,
the
old
Welshman
said:
"They
won't
tell--and
I
won't.
But
why
don't
you
want
it
known?"
Huck
would
not
explain,
further
than
to
say
that
he
already
knew
too
much
about
one
of
those
men
and
would
not
have
the
man
know
that
he
knew
anything
against
him
for
the
whole
world--he
would
be
killed
for
knowing
it,
sure.
The
old
man
promised
secrecy
once
more,
and
said:
"How
did
you
come
to
follow
these
fellows,
lad?
Were
they
looking
suspicious?"
Huck
was
silent
while
he
framed
a
duly
cautious
reply.
Then
he
said:
"Well,
you
see,
I'm
a
kind
of
a
hard
lot,--least
everybody
says
so,
and
I
don't
see
nothing
agin
it--and
sometimes
I
can't
sleep
much,
on
account
of
thinking
about
it
and
sort
of
trying
to
strike
out
a
new
way
of
doing.
That
was
the
way
of
it
last
night.
I
couldn't
sleep,
and
so
I
come
along
up-street
'bout
midnight,
a-turning
it
all
over,
and
when
I
got
to
that
old
shackly
brick
store
by
the
Temperance
Tavern,
I
backed
up
agin
the
wall
to
have
another
think.
Well,
just
then
along
comes
these
two
chaps
slipping
along
close
by
me,
with
something
under
their
arm,
and
I
reckoned
they'd
stole
it.
One
was
a-smoking,
and
t'other
one
wanted
a
light;
so
they
stopped
right
before
me
and
the
cigars
lit
up
their
faces
and
I
see
that
the
big
one
was
the
deaf
and
dumb
Spaniard,
by
his
white
whiskers
and
the
patch
on
his
eye,
and
t'other
one
was
a
rusty,
ragged-looking
devil."
"Could
you
see
the
rags
by
the
light
of
the
cigars?"
This
staggered
Huck
for
a
moment.
Then
he
said:
"Well,
I
don't
know--but
somehow
it
seems
as
if
I
did."
"Then
they
went
on,
and
you--"
"Follered
'em--yes.
That
was
it.
I
wanted
to
see
what
was
up--they
sneaked
along
so.
I
dogged
'em
to
the
widder's
stile,
and
stood
in
the
dark
and
heard
the
ragged
one
beg
for
the
widder,
and
the
Spaniard
swear
he'd
spile
her
looks
just
as
I
told
you
and
your
two--"
"What!
The
DEAF
AND
DUMB
man
said
all
that!"
Huck
had
made
another
terrible
mistake!
He
was
trying
his
best
to
keep
the
old
man
from
getting
the
faintest
hint
of
who
the
Spaniard
might
be,
and
yet
his
tongue
seemed
determined
to
get
him
into
trouble
in
spite
of
all
he
could
do.
He
made
several
efforts
to
creep
out
of
his
scrape,
but
the
old
man's
eye
was
upon
him
and
he
made
blunder
after
blunder.
Presently
the
Welshman
said:
"My
boy,
don't
be
afraid
of
me.
I
wouldn't
hurt
a
hair
of
your
head
for
all
the
world.
No--I'd
protect
you--I'd
protect
you.
This
Spaniard
is
not
deaf
and
dumb;
you've
let
that
slip
without
intending
it;
you
can't
cover
that
up
now.
You
know
something
about
that
Spaniard
that
you
want
to
keep
dark.
Now
trust
me--tell
me
what
it
is,
and
trust
me
--I
won't
betray
you."
Huck
looked
into
the
old
man's
honest
eyes
a
moment,
then
bent
over
and
whispered
in
his
ear:
"'Tain't
a
Spaniard--it's
Injun
Joe!"
The
Welshman
almost
jumped
out
of
his
chair.
In
a
moment
he
said:
"It's
all
plain
enough,
now.
When
you
talked
about
notching
ears
and
slitting
noses
I
judged
that
that
was
your
own
embellishment,
because
white
men
don't
take
that
sort
of
revenge.
But
an
Injun!
That's
a
different
matter
altogether."
During
breakfast
the
talk
went
on,
and
in
the
course
of
it
the
old
man
said
that
the
last
thing
which
he
and
his
sons
had
done,
before
going
to
bed,
was
to
get
a
lantern
and
examine
the
stile
and
its
vicinity
for
marks
of
blood.
They
found
none,
but
captured
a
bulky
bundle
of--
"Of
WHAT?"
If
the
words
had
been
lightning
they
could
not
have
leaped
with
a
more
stunning
suddenness
from
Huck's
blanched
lips.
His
eyes
were
staring
wide,
now,
and
his
breath
suspended--waiting
for
the
answer.
The
Welshman
started--stared
in
return--three
seconds--five
seconds--ten
--then
replied:
"Of
burglar's
tools.
Why,
what's
the
MATTER
with
you?"
Huck
sank
back,
panting
gently,
but
deeply,
unutterably
grateful.
The
Welshman
eyed
him
gravely,
curiously--and
presently
said:
"Yes,
burglar's
tools.
That
appears
to
relieve
you
a
good
deal.
But
what
did
give
you
that
turn?
What
were
YOU
expecting
we'd
found?"
Huck
was
in
a
close
place--the
inquiring
eye
was
upon
him--he
would
have
given
anything
for
material
for
a
plausible
answer--nothing
suggested
itself--the
inquiring
eye
was
boring
deeper
and
deeper--a
senseless
reply
offered--there
was
no
time
to
weigh
it,
so
at
a
venture
he
uttered
it--feebly:
"Sunday-school
books,
maybe."
Poor
Huck
was
too
distressed
to
smile,
but
the
old
man
laughed
loud
and
joyously,
shook
up
the
details
of
his
anatomy
from
head
to
foot,
and
ended
by
saying
that
such
a
laugh
was
money
in
a-man's
pocket,
because
it
cut
down
the
doctor's
bill
like
everything.
Then
he
added:
"Poor
old
chap,
you're
white
and
jaded--you
ain't
well
a
bit--no
wonder
you're
a
little
flighty
and
off
your
balance.
But
you'll
come
out
of
it.
Rest
and
sleep
will
fetch
you
out
all
right,
I
hope."
Huck
was
irritated
to
think
he
had
been
such
a
goose
and
betrayed
such
a
suspicious
excitement,
for
he
had
dropped
the
idea
that
the
parcel
brought
from
the
tavern
was
the
treasure,
as
soon
as
he
had
heard
the
talk
at
the
widow's
stile.
He
had
only
thought
it
was
not
the
treasure,
however--he
had
not
known
that
it
wasn't--and
so
the
suggestion
of
a
captured
bundle
was
too
much
for
his
self-possession.
But
on
the
whole
he
felt
glad
the
little
episode
had
happened,
for
now
he
knew
beyond
all
question
that
that
bundle
was
not
THE
bundle,
and
so
his
mind
was
at
rest
and
exceedingly
comfortable.
In
fact,
everything
seemed
to
be
drifting
just
in
the
right
direction,
now;
the
treasure
must
be
still
in
No.
2,
the
men
would
be
captured
and
jailed
that
day,
and
he
and
Tom
could
seize
the
gold
that
night
without
any
trouble
or
any
fear
of
interruption.
Just
as
breakfast
was
completed
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door.
Huck
jumped
for
a
hiding-place,
for
he
had
no
mind
to
be
connected
even
remotely
with
the
late
event.
The
Welshman
admitted
several
ladies
and
gentlemen,
among
them
the
Widow
Douglas,
and
noticed
that
groups
of
citizens
were
climbing
up
the
hill--to
stare
at
the
stile.
So
the
news
had
spread.
The
Welshman
had
to
tell
the
story
of
the
night
to
the
visitors.
The
widow's
gratitude
for
her
preservation
was
outspoken.
"Don't
say
a
word
about
it,
madam.
There's
another
that
you're
more
beholden
to
than
you
are
to
me
and
my
boys,
maybe,
but
he
don't
allow
me
to
tell
his
name.
We
wouldn't
have
been
there
but
for
him."
Of
course
this
excited
a
curiosity
so
vast
that
it
almost
belittled
the
main
matter--but
the
Welshman
allowed
it
to
eat
into
the
vitals
of
his
visitors,
and
through
them
be
transmitted
to
the
whole
town,
for
he
refused
to
part
with
his
secret.
When
all
else
had
been
learned,
the
widow
said:
"I
went
to
sleep
reading
in
bed
and
slept
straight
through
all
that
noise.
Why
didn't
you
come
and
wake
me?"
"We
judged
it
warn't
worth
while.
Those
fellows
warn't
likely
to
come
again--they
hadn't
any
tools
left
to
work
with,
and
what
was
the
use
of
waking
you
up
and
scaring
you
to
death?
My
three
negro
men
stood
guard
at
your
house
all
the
rest
of
the
night.
They've
just
come
back."
More
visitors
came,
and
the
story
had
to
be
told
and
retold
for
a
couple
of
hours
more.
There
was
no
Sabbath-school
during
day-school
vacation,
but
everybody
was
early
at
church.
The
stirring
event
was
well
canvassed.
News
came
that
not
a
sign
of
the
two
villains
had
been
yet
discovered.
When
the
sermon
was
finished,
Judge
Thatcher's
wife
dropped
alongside
of
Mrs.
Harper
as
she
moved
down
the
aisle
with
the
crowd
and
said:
"Is
my
Becky
going
to
sleep
all
day?
I
just
expected
she
would
be
tired
to
death."
"Your
Becky?"
"Yes,"
with
a
startled
look--"didn't
she
stay
with
you
last
night?"
"Why,
no."
Mrs.
Thatcher
turned
pale,
and
sank
into
a
pew,
just
as
Aunt
Polly,
talking
briskly
with
a
friend,
passed
by.
Aunt
Polly
said:
"Good-morning,
Mrs.
Thatcher.
Good-morning,
Mrs.
Harper.
I've
got
a
boy
that's
turned
up
missing.
I
reckon
my
Tom
stayed
at
your
house
last
night--one
of
you.
And
now
he's
afraid
to
come
to
church.
I've
got
to
settle
with
him."
Mrs.
Thatcher
shook
her
head
feebly
and
turned
paler
than
ever.
"He
didn't
stay
with
us,"
said
Mrs.
Harper,
beginning
to
look
uneasy.
A
marked
anxiety
came
into
Aunt
Polly's
face.
"Joe
Harper,
have
you
seen
my
Tom
this
morning?"
"No'm."
"When
did
you
see
him
last?"
Joe
tried
to
remember,
but
was
not
sure
he
could
say.
The
people
had
stopped
moving
out
of
church.
Whispers
passed
along,
and
a
boding
uneasiness
took
possession
of
every
countenance.
Children
were
anxiously
questioned,
and
young
teachers.
They
all
said
they
had
not
noticed
whether
Tom
and
Becky
were
on
board
the
ferryboat
on
the
homeward
trip;
it
was
dark;
no
one
thought
of
inquiring
if
any
one
was
missing.
One
young
man
finally
blurted
out
his
fear
that
they
were
still
in
the
cave!
Mrs.
Thatcher
swooned
away.
Aunt
Polly
fell
to
crying
and
wringing
her
hands.
The
alarm
swept
from
lip
to
lip,
from
group
to
group,
from
street
to
street,
and
within
five
minutes
the
bells
were
wildly
clanging
and
the
whole
town
was
up!
The
Cardiff
Hill
episode
sank
into
instant
insignificance,
the
burglars
were
forgotten,
horses
were
saddled,
skiffs
were
manned,
the
ferryboat
ordered
out,
and
before
the
horror
was
half
an
hour
old,
two
hundred
men
were
pouring
down
highroad
and
river
toward
the
cave.
All
the
long
afternoon
the
village
seemed
empty
and
dead.
Many
women
visited
Aunt
Polly
and
Mrs.
Thatcher
and
tried
to
comfort
them.
They
cried
with
them,
too,
and
that
was
still
better
than
words.
All
the
tedious
night
the
town
waited
for
news;
but
when
the
morning
dawned
at
last,
all
the
word
that
came
was,
"Send
more
candles--and
send
food."
Mrs.
Thatcher
was
almost
crazed;
and
Aunt
Polly,
also.
Judge
Thatcher
sent
messages
of
hope
and
encouragement
from
the
cave,
but
they
conveyed
no
real
cheer.
The
old
Welshman
came
home
toward
daylight,
spattered
with
candle-grease,
smeared
with
clay,
and
almost
worn
out.
He
found
Huck
still
in
the
bed
that
had
been
provided
for
him,
and
delirious
with
fever.
The
physicians
were
all
at
the
cave,
so
the
Widow
Douglas
came
and
took
charge
of
the
patient.
She
said
she
would
do
her
best
by
him,
because,
whether
he
was
good,
bad,
or
indifferent,
he
was
the
Lord's,
and
nothing
that
was
the
Lord's
was
a
thing
to
be
neglected.
The
Welshman
said
Huck
had
good
spots
in
him,
and
the
widow
said:
"You
can
depend
on
it.
That's
the
Lord's
mark.
He
don't
leave
it
off.
He
never
does.
Puts
it
somewhere
on
every
creature
that
comes
from
his
hands."
Early
in
the
forenoon
parties
of
jaded
men
began
to
straggle
into
the
village,
but
the
strongest
of
the
citizens
continued
searching.
All
the
news
that
could
be
gained
was
that
remotenesses
of
the
cavern
were
being
ransacked
that
had
never
been
visited
before;
that
every
corner
and
crevice
was
going
to
be
thoroughly
searched;
that
wherever
one
wandered
through
the
maze
of
passages,
lights
were
to
be
seen
flitting
hither
and
thither
in
the
distance,
and
shoutings
and
pistol-shots
sent
their
hollow
reverberations
to
the
ear
down
the
sombre
aisles.
In
one
place,
far
from
the
section
usually
traversed
by
tourists,
the
names
"BECKY
&
TOM"
had
been
found
traced
upon
the
rocky
wall
with
candle-smoke,
and
near
at
hand
a
grease-soiled
bit
of
ribbon.
Mrs.
Thatcher
recognized
the
ribbon
and
cried
over
it.
She
said
it
was
the
last
relic
she
should
ever
have
of
her
child;
and
that
no
other
memorial
of
her
could
ever
be
so
precious,
because
this
one
parted
latest
from
the
living
body
before
the
awful
death
came.
Some
said
that
now
and
then,
in
the
cave,
a
far-away
speck
of
light
would
glimmer,
and
then
a
glorious
shout
would
burst
forth
and
a
score
of
men
go
trooping
down
the
echoing
aisle--and
then
a
sickening
disappointment
always
followed;
the
children
were
not
there;
it
was
only
a
searcher's
light.
Three
dreadful
days
and
nights
dragged
their
tedious
hours
along,
and
the
village
sank
into
a
hopeless
stupor.
No
one
had
heart
for
anything.
The
accidental
discovery,
just
made,
that
the
proprietor
of
the
Temperance
Tavern
kept
liquor
on
his
premises,
scarcely
fluttered
the
public
pulse,
tremendous
as
the
fact
was.
In
a
lucid
interval,
Huck
feebly
led
up
to
the
subject
of
taverns,
and
finally
asked--dimly
dreading
the
worst--if
anything
had
been
discovered
at
the
Temperance
Tavern
since
he
had
been
ill.
"Yes,"
said
the
widow.
Huck
started
up
in
bed,
wild-eyed:
"What?
What
was
it?"
"Liquor!--and
the
place
has
been
shut
up.
Lie
down,
child--what
a
turn
you
did
give
me!"
"Only
tell
me
just
one
thing--only
just
one--please!
Was
it
Tom
Sawyer
that
found
it?"
The
widow
burst
into
tears.
"Hush,
hush,
child,
hush!
I've
told
you
before,
you
must
NOT
talk.
You
are
very,
very
sick!"
Then
nothing
but
liquor
had
been
found;
there
would
have
been
a
great
powwow
if
it
had
been
the
gold.
So
the
treasure
was
gone
forever--gone
forever!
But
what
could
she
be
crying
about?
Curious
that
she
should
cry.
These
thoughts
worked
their
dim
way
through
Huck's
mind,
and
under
the
weariness
they
gave
him
he
fell
asleep.
The
widow
said
to
herself:
"There--he's
asleep,
poor
wreck.
Tom
Sawyer
find
it!
Pity
but
somebody
could
find
Tom
Sawyer!
Ah,
there
ain't
many
left,
now,
that's
got
hope
enough,
or
strength
enough,
either,
to
go
on
searching."
CHAPTER
XXXI
NOW
to
return
to
Tom
and
Becky's
share
in
the
picnic.
They
tripped
along
the
murky
aisles
with
the
rest
of
the
company,
visiting
the
familiar
wonders
of
the
cave--wonders
dubbed
with
rather
over-descriptive
names,
such
as
"The
Drawing-Room,"
"The
Cathedral,"
"Aladdin's
Palace,"
and
so
on.
Presently
the
hide-and-seek
frolicking
began,
and
Tom
and
Becky
engaged
in
it
with
zeal
until
the
exertion
began
to
grow
a
trifle
wearisome;
then
they
wandered
down
a
sinuous
avenue
holding
their
candles
aloft
and
reading
the
tangled
web-work
of
names,
dates,
post-office
addresses,
and
mottoes
with
which
the
rocky
walls
had
been
frescoed
(in
candle-smoke).
Still
drifting
along
and
talking,
they
scarcely
noticed
that
they
were
now
in
a
part
of
the
cave
whose
walls
were
not
frescoed.
They
smoked
their
own
names
under
an
overhanging
shelf
and
moved
on.
Presently
they
came
to
a
place
where
a
little
stream
of
water,
trickling
over
a
ledge
and
carrying
a
limestone
sediment
with
it,
had,
in
the
slow-dragging
ages,
formed
a
laced
and
ruffled
Niagara
in
gleaming
and
imperishable
stone.
Tom
squeezed
his
small
body
behind
it
in
order
to
illuminate
it
for
Becky's
gratification.
He
found
that
it
curtained
a
sort
of
steep
natural
stairway
which
was
enclosed
between
narrow
walls,
and
at
once
the
ambition
to
be
a
discoverer
seized
him.
Becky
responded
to
his
call,
and
they
made
a
smoke-mark
for
future
guidance,
and
started
upon
their
quest.
They
wound
this
way
and
that,
far
down
into
the
secret
depths
of
the
cave,
made
another
mark,
and
branched
off
in
search
of
novelties
to
tell
the
upper
world
about.
In
one
place
they
found
a
spacious
cavern,
from
whose
ceiling
depended
a
multitude
of
shining
stalactites
of
the
length
and
circumference
of
a
man's
leg;
they
walked
all
about
it,
wondering
and
admiring,
and
presently
left
it
by
one
of
the
numerous
passages
that
opened
into
it.
This
shortly
brought
them
to
a
bewitching
spring,
whose
basin
was
incrusted
with
a
frostwork
of
glittering
crystals;
it
was
in
the
midst
of
a
cavern
whose
walls
were
supported
by
many
fantastic
pillars
which
had
been
formed
by
the
joining
of
great
stalactites
and
stalagmites
together,
the
result
of
the
ceaseless
water-drip
of
centuries.
Under
the
roof
vast
knots
of
bats
had
packed
themselves
together,
thousands
in
a
bunch;
the
lights
disturbed
the
creatures
and
they
came
flocking
down
by
hundreds,
squeaking
and
darting
furiously
at
the
candles.
Tom
knew
their
ways
and
the
danger
of
this
sort
of
conduct.
He
seized
Becky's
hand
and
hurried
her
into
the
first
corridor
that
offered;
and
none
too
soon,
for
a
bat
struck
Becky's
light
out
with
its
wing
while
she
was
passing
out
of
the
cavern.
The
bats
chased
the
children
a
good
distance;
but
the
fugitives
plunged
into
every
new
passage
that
offered,
and
at
last
got
rid
of
the
perilous
things.
Tom
found
a
subterranean
lake,
shortly,
which
stretched
its
dim
length
away
until
its
shape
was
lost
in
the
shadows.
He
wanted
to
explore
its
borders,
but
concluded
that
it
would
be
best
to
sit
down
and
rest
awhile,
first.
Now,
for
the
first
time,
the
deep
stillness
of
the
place
laid
a
clammy
hand
upon
the
spirits
of
the
children.
Becky
said:
"Why,
I
didn't
notice,
but
it
seems
ever
so
long
since
I
heard
any
of
the
others."
"Come
to
think,
Becky,
we
are
away
down
below
them--and
I
don't
know
how
far
away
north,
or
south,
or
east,
or
whichever
it
is.
We
couldn't
hear
them
here."
Becky
grew
apprehensive.
"I
wonder
how
long
we've
been
down
here,
Tom?
We
better
start
back."
"Yes,
I
reckon
we
better.
P'raps
we
better."
"Can
you
find
the
way,
Tom?
It's
all
a
mixed-up
crookedness
to
me."
"I
reckon
I
could
find
it--but
then
the
bats.
If
they
put
our
candles
out
it
will
be
an
awful
fix.
Let's
try
some
other
way,
so
as
not
to
go
through
there."
"Well.
But
I
hope
we
won't
get
lost.
It
would
be
so
awful!"
and
the
girl
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
the
dreadful
possibilities.
They
started
through
a
corridor,
and
traversed
it
in
silence
a
long
way,
glancing
at
each
new
opening,
to
see
if
there
was
anything
familiar
about
the
look
of
it;
but
they
were
all
strange.
Every
time
Tom
made
an
examination,
Becky
would
watch
his
face
for
an
encouraging
sign,
and
he
would
say
cheerily:
"Oh,
it's
all
right.
This
ain't
the
one,
but
we'll
come
to
it
right
away!"
But
he
felt
less
and
less
hopeful
with
each
failure,
and
presently
began
to
turn
off
into
diverging
avenues
at
sheer
random,
in
desperate
hope
of
finding
the
one
that
was
wanted.
He
still
said
it
was
"all
right,"
but
there
was
such
a
leaden
dread
at
his
heart
that
the
words
had
lost
their
ring
and
sounded
just
as
if
he
had
said,
"All
is
lost!"
Becky
clung
to
his
side
in
an
anguish
of
fear,
and
tried
hard
to
keep
back
the
tears,
but
they
would
come.
At
last
she
said:
"Oh,
Tom,
never
mind
the
bats,
let's
go
back
that
way!
We
seem
to
get
worse
and
worse
off
all
the
time."
"Listen!"
said
he.
Profound
silence;
silence
so
deep
that
even
their
breathings
were
conspicuous
in
the
hush.
Tom
shouted.
The
call
went
echoing
down
the
empty
aisles
and
died
out
in
the
distance
in
a
faint
sound
that
resembled
a
ripple
of
mocking
laughter.
"Oh,
don't
do
it
again,
Tom,
it
is
too
horrid,"
said
Becky.
"It
is
horrid,
but
I
better,
Becky;
they
might
hear
us,
you
know,"
and
he
shouted
again.
The
"might"
was
even
a
chillier
horror
than
the
ghostly
laughter,
it
so
confessed
a
perishing
hope.
The
children
stood
still
and
listened;
but
there
was
no
result.
Tom
turned
upon
the
back
track
at
once,
and
hurried
his
steps.
It
was
but
a
little
while
before
a
certain
indecision
in
his
manner
revealed
another
fearful
fact
to
Becky--he
could
not
find
his
way
back!
"Oh,
Tom,
you
didn't
make
any
marks!"
"Becky,
I
was
such
a
fool!
Such
a
fool!
I
never
thought
we
might
want
to
come
back!
No--I
can't
find
the
way.
It's
all
mixed
up."
"Tom,
Tom,
we're
lost!
we're
lost!
We
never
can
get
out
of
this
awful
place!
Oh,
why
DID
we
ever
leave
the
others!"
She
sank
to
the
ground
and
burst
into
such
a
frenzy
of
crying
that
Tom
was
appalled
with
the
idea
that
she
might
die,
or
lose
her
reason.
He
sat
down
by
her
and
put
his
arms
around
her;
she
buried
her
face
in
his
bosom,
she
clung
to
him,
she
poured
out
her
terrors,
her
unavailing
regrets,
and
the
far
echoes
turned
them
all
to
jeering
laughter.
Tom
begged
her
to
pluck
up
hope
again,
and
she
said
she
could
not.
He
fell
to
blaming
and
abusing
himself
for
getting
her
into
this
miserable
situation;
this
had
a
better
effect.
She
said
she
would
try
to
hope
again,
she
would
get
up
and
follow
wherever
he
might
lead
if
only
he
would
not
talk
like
that
any
more.
For
he
was
no
more
to
blame
than
she,
she
said.
So
they
moved
on
again--aimlessly--simply
at
random--all
they
could
do
was
to
move,
keep
moving.
For
a
little
while,
hope
made
a
show
of
reviving--not
with
any
reason
to
back
it,
but
only
because
it
is
its
nature
to
revive
when
the
spring
has
not
been
taken
out
of
it
by
age
and
familiarity
with
failure.
By-and-by
Tom
took
Becky's
candle
and
blew
it
out.
This
economy
meant
so
much!
Words
were
not
needed.
Becky
understood,
and
her
hope
died
again.
She
knew
that
Tom
had
a
whole
candle
and
three
or
four
pieces
in
his
pockets--yet
he
must
economize.
By-and-by,
fatigue
began
to
assert
its
claims;
the
children
tried
to
pay
attention,
for
it
was
dreadful
to
think
of
sitting
down
when
time
was
grown
to
be
so
precious,
moving,
in
some
direction,
in
any
direction,
was
at
least
progress
and
might
bear
fruit;
but
to
sit
down
was
to
invite
death
and
shorten
its
pursuit.
At
last
Becky's
frail
limbs
refused
to
carry
her
farther.
She
sat
down.
Tom
rested
with
her,
and
they
talked
of
home,
and
the
friends
there,
and
the
comfortable
beds
and,
above
all,
the
light!
Becky
cried,
and
Tom
tried
to
think
of
some
way
of
comforting
her,
but
all
his
encouragements
were
grown
threadbare
with
use,
and
sounded
like
sarcasms.
Fatigue
bore
so
heavily
upon
Becky
that
she
drowsed
off
to
sleep.
Tom
was
grateful.
He
sat
looking
into
her
drawn
face
and
saw
it
grow
smooth
and
natural
under
the
influence
of
pleasant
dreams;
and
by-and-by
a
smile
dawned
and
rested
there.
The
peaceful
face
reflected
somewhat
of
peace
and
healing
into
his
own
spirit,
and
his
thoughts
wandered
away
to
bygone
times
and
dreamy
memories.
While
he
was
deep
in
his
musings,
Becky
woke
up
with
a
breezy
little
laugh--but
it
was
stricken
dead
upon
her
lips,
and
a
groan
followed
it.
"Oh,
how
COULD
I
sleep!
I
wish
I
never,
never
had
waked!
No!
No,
I
don't,
Tom!
Don't
look
so!
I
won't
say
it
again."
"I'm
glad
you've
slept,
Becky;
you'll
feel
rested,
now,
and
we'll
find
the
way
out."
"We
can
try,
Tom;
but
I've
seen
such
a
beautiful
country
in
my
dream.
I
reckon
we
are
going
there."
"Maybe
not,
maybe
not.
Cheer
up,
Becky,
and
let's
go
on
trying."
They
rose
up
and
wandered
along,
hand
in
hand
and
hopeless.
They
tried
to
estimate
how
long
they
had
been
in
the
cave,
but
all
they
knew
was
that
it
seemed
days
and
weeks,
and
yet
it
was
plain
that
this
could
not
be,
for
their
candles
were
not
gone
yet.
A
long
time
after
this--they
could
not
tell
how
long--Tom
said
they
must
go
softly
and
listen
for
dripping
water--they
must
find
a
spring.
They
found
one
presently,
and
Tom
said
it
was
time
to
rest
again.
Both
were
cruelly
tired,
yet
Becky
said
she
thought
she
could
go
a
little
farther.
She
was
surprised
to
hear
Tom
dissent.
She
could
not
understand
it.
They
sat
down,
and
Tom
fastened
his
candle
to
the
wall
in
front
of
them
with
some
clay.
Thought
was
soon
busy;
nothing
was
said
for
some
time.
Then
Becky
broke
the
silence:
"Tom,
I
am
so
hungry!"
Tom
took
something
out
of
his
pocket.
"Do
you
remember
this?"
said
he.
Becky
almost
smiled.
"It's
our
wedding-cake,
Tom."
"Yes--I
wish
it
was
as
big
as
a
barrel,
for
it's
all
we've
got."
"I
saved
it
from
the
picnic
for
us
to
dream
on,
Tom,
the
way
grown-up
people
do
with
wedding-cake--but
it'll
be
our--"
She
dropped
the
sentence
where
it
was.
Tom
divided
the
cake
and
Becky
ate
with
good
appetite,
while
Tom
nibbled
at
his
moiety.
There
was
abundance
of
cold
water
to
finish
the
feast
with.
By-and-by
Becky
suggested
that
they
move
on
again.
Tom
was
silent
a
moment.
Then
he
said:
"Becky,
can
you
bear
it
if
I
tell
you
something?"
Becky's
face
paled,
but
she
thought
she
could.
"Well,
then,
Becky,
we
must
stay
here,
where
there's
water
to
drink.
That
little
piece
is
our
last
candle!"
Becky
gave
loose
to
tears
and
wailings.
Tom
did
what
he
could
to
comfort
her,
but
with
little
effect.
At
length
Becky
said:
"Tom!"
"Well,
Becky?"
"They'll
miss
us
and
hunt
for
us!"
"Yes,
they
will!
Certainly
they
will!"
"Maybe
they're
hunting
for
us
now,
Tom."
"Why,
I
reckon
maybe
they
are.
I
hope
they
are."
"When
would
they
miss
us,
Tom?"
"When
they
get
back
to
the
boat,
I
reckon."
"Tom,
it
might
be
dark
then--would
they
notice
we
hadn't
come?"
"I
don't
know.
But
anyway,
your
mother
would
miss
you
as
soon
as
they
got
home."
A
frightened
look
in
Becky's
face
brought
Tom
to
his
senses
and
he
saw
that
he
had
made
a
blunder.
Becky
was
not
to
have
gone
home
that
night!
The
children
became
silent
and
thoughtful.
In
a
moment
a
new
burst
of
grief
from
Becky
showed
Tom
that
the
thing
in
his
mind
had
struck
hers
also--that
the
Sabbath
morning
might
be
half
spent
before
Mrs.
Thatcher
discovered
that
Becky
was
not
at
Mrs.
Harper's.
The
children
fastened
their
eyes
upon
their
bit
of
candle
and
watched
it
melt
slowly
and
pitilessly
away;
saw
the
half
inch
of
wick
stand
alone
at
last;
saw
the
feeble
flame
rise
and
fall,
climb
the
thin
column
of
smoke,
linger
at
its
top
a
moment,
and
then--the
horror
of
utter
darkness
reigned!
How
long
afterward
it
was
that
Becky
came
to
a
slow
consciousness
that
she
was
crying
in
Tom's
arms,
neither
could
tell.
All
that
they
knew
was,
that
after
what
seemed
a
mighty
stretch
of
time,
both
awoke
out
of
a
dead
stupor
of
sleep
and
resumed
their
miseries
once
more.
Tom
said
it
might
be
Sunday,
now--maybe
Monday.
He
tried
to
get
Becky
to
talk,
but
her
sorrows
were
too
oppressive,
all
her
hopes
were
gone.
Tom
said
that
they
must
have
been
missed
long
ago,
and
no
doubt
the
search
was
going
on.
He
would
shout
and
maybe
some
one
would
come.
He
tried
it;
but
in
the
darkness
the
distant
echoes
sounded
so
hideously
that
he
tried
it
no
more.
The
hours
wasted
away,
and
hunger
came
to
torment
the
captives
again.
A
portion
of
Tom's
half
of
the
cake
was
left;
they
divided
and
ate
it.
But
they
seemed
hungrier
than
before.
The
poor
morsel
of
food
only
whetted
desire.
By-and-by
Tom
said:
"SH!
Did
you
hear
that?"
Both
held
their
breath
and
listened.
There
was
a
sound
like
the
faintest,
far-off
shout.
Instantly
Tom
answered
it,
and
leading
Becky
by
the
hand,
started
groping
down
the
corridor
in
its
direction.
Presently
he
listened
again;
again
the
sound
was
heard,
and
apparently
a
little
nearer.
"It's
them!"
said
Tom;
"they're
coming!
Come
along,
Becky--we're
all
right
now!"
The
joy
of
the
prisoners
was
almost
overwhelming.
Their
speed
was
slow,
however,
because
pitfalls
were
somewhat
common,
and
had
to
be
guarded
against.
They
shortly
came
to
one
and
had
to
stop.
It
might
be
three
feet
deep,
it
might
be
a
hundred--there
was
no
passing
it
at
any
rate.
Tom
got
down
on
his
breast
and
reached
as
far
down
as
he
could.
No
bottom.
They
must
stay
there
and
wait
until
the
searchers
came.
They
listened;
evidently
the
distant
shoutings
were
growing
more
distant!
a
moment
or
two
more
and
they
had
gone
altogether.
The
heart-sinking
misery
of
it!
Tom
whooped
until
he
was
hoarse,
but
it
was
of
no
use.
He
talked
hopefully
to
Becky;
but
an
age
of
anxious
waiting
passed
and
no
sounds
came
again.
The
children
groped
their
way
back
to
the
spring.
The
weary
time
dragged
on;
they
slept
again,
and
awoke
famished
and
woe-stricken.
Tom
believed
it
must
be
Tuesday
by
this
time.
Now
an
idea
struck
him.
There
were
some
side
passages
near
at
hand.
It
would
be
better
to
explore
some
of
these
than
bear
the
weight
of
the
heavy
time
in
idleness.
He
took
a
kite-line
from
his
pocket,
tied
it
to
a
projection,
and
he
and
Becky
started,
Tom
in
the
lead,
unwinding
the
line
as
he
groped
along.
At
the
end
of
twenty
steps
the
corridor
ended
in
a
"jumping-off
place."
Tom
got
down
on
his
knees
and
felt
below,
and
then
as
far
around
the
corner
as
he
could
reach
with
his
hands
conveniently;
he
made
an
effort
to
stretch
yet
a
little
farther
to
the
right,
and
at
that
moment,
not
twenty
yards
away,
a
human
hand,
holding
a
candle,
appeared
from
behind
a
rock!
Tom
lifted
up
a
glorious
shout,
and
instantly
that
hand
was
followed
by
the
body
it
belonged
to--Injun
Joe's!
Tom
was
paralyzed;
he
could
not
move.
He
was
vastly
gratified
the
next
moment,
to
see
the
"Spaniard"
take
to
his
heels
and
get
himself
out
of
sight.
Tom
wondered
that
Joe
had
not
recognized
his
voice
and
come
over
and
killed
him
for
testifying
in
court.
But
the
echoes
must
have
disguised
the
voice.
Without
doubt,
that
was
it,
he
reasoned.
Tom's
fright
weakened
every
muscle
in
his
body.
He
said
to
himself
that
if
he
had
strength
enough
to
get
back
to
the
spring
he
would
stay
there,
and
nothing
should
tempt
him
to
run
the
risk
of
meeting
Injun
Joe
again.
He
was
careful
to
keep
from
Becky
what
it
was
he
had
seen.
He
told
her
he
had
only
shouted
"for
luck."
But
hunger
and
wretchedness
rise
superior
to
fears
in
the
long
run.
Another
tedious
wait
at
the
spring
and
another
long
sleep
brought
changes.
The
children
awoke
tortured
with
a
raging
hunger.
Tom
believed
that
it
must
be
Wednesday
or
Thursday
or
even
Friday
or
Saturday,
now,
and
that
the
search
had
been
given
over.
He
proposed
to
explore
another
passage.
He
felt
willing
to
risk
Injun
Joe
and
all
other
terrors.
But
Becky
was
very
weak.
She
had
sunk
into
a
dreary
apathy
and
would
not
be
roused.
She
said
she
would
wait,
now,
where
she
was,
and
die--it
would
not
be
long.
She
told
Tom
to
go
with
the
kite-line
and
explore
if
he
chose;
but
she
implored
him
to
come
back
every
little
while
and
speak
to
her;
and
she
made
him
promise
that
when
the
awful
time
came,
he
would
stay
by
her
and
hold
her
hand
until
all
was
over.
Tom
kissed
her,
with
a
choking
sensation
in
his
throat,
and
made
a
show
of
being
confident
of
finding
the
searchers
or
an
escape
from
the
cave;
then
he
took
the
kite-line
in
his
hand
and
went
groping
down
one
of
the
passages
on
his
hands
and
knees,
distressed
with
hunger
and
sick
with
bodings
of
coming
doom.
CHAPTER
XXXII
TUESDAY
afternoon
came,
and
waned
to
the
twilight.
The
village
of
St.
Petersburg
still
mourned.
The
lost
children
had
not
been
found.
Public
prayers
had
been
offered
up
for
them,
and
many
and
many
a
private
prayer
that
had
the
petitioner's
whole
heart
in
it;
but
still
no
good
news
came
from
the
cave.
The
majority
of
the
searchers
had
given
up
the
quest
and
gone
back
to
their
daily
avocations,
saying
that
it
was
plain
the
children
could
never
be
found.
Mrs.
Thatcher
was
very
ill,
and
a
great
part
of
the
time
delirious.
People
said
it
was
heartbreaking
to
hear
her
call
her
child,
and
raise
her
head
and
listen
a
whole
minute
at
a
time,
then
lay
it
wearily
down
again
with
a
moan.
Aunt
Polly
had
drooped
into
a
settled
melancholy,
and
her
gray
hair
had
grown
almost
white.
The
village
went
to
its
rest
on
Tuesday
night,
sad
and
forlorn.
Away
in
the
middle
of
the
night
a
wild
peal
burst
from
the
village
bells,
and
in
a
moment
the
streets
were
swarming
with
frantic
half-clad
people,
who
shouted,
"Turn
out!
turn
out!
they're
found!
they're
found!"
Tin
pans
and
horns
were
added
to
the
din,
the
population
massed
itself
and
moved
toward
the
river,
met
the
children
coming
in
an
open
carriage
drawn
by
shouting
citizens,
thronged
around
it,
joined
its
homeward
march,
and
swept
magnificently
up
the
main
street
roaring
huzzah
after
huzzah!
The
village
was
illuminated;
nobody
went
to
bed
again;
it
was
the
greatest
night
the
little
town
had
ever
seen.
During
the
first
half-hour
a
procession
of
villagers
filed
through
Judge
Thatcher's
house,
seized
the
saved
ones
and
kissed
them,
squeezed
Mrs.
Thatcher's
hand,
tried
to
speak
but
couldn't--and
drifted
out
raining
tears
all
over
the
place.
Aunt
Polly's
happiness
was
complete,
and
Mrs.
Thatcher's
nearly
so.
It
would
be
complete,
however,
as
soon
as
the
messenger
dispatched
with
the
great
news
to
the
cave
should
get
the
word
to
her
husband.
Tom
lay
upon
a
sofa
with
an
eager
auditory
about
him
and
told
the
history
of
the
wonderful
adventure,
putting
in
many
striking
additions
to
adorn
it
withal;
and
closed
with
a
description
of
how
he
left
Becky
and
went
on
an
exploring
expedition;
how
he
followed
two
avenues
as
far
as
his
kite-line
would
reach;
how
he
followed
a
third
to
the
fullest
stretch
of
the
kite-line,
and
was
about
to
turn
back
when
he
glimpsed
a
far-off
speck
that
looked
like
daylight;
dropped
the
line
and
groped
toward
it,
pushed
his
head
and
shoulders
through
a
small
hole,
and
saw
the
broad
Mississippi
rolling
by!
And
if
it
had
only
happened
to
be
night
he
would
not
have
seen
that
speck
of
daylight
and
would
not
have
explored
that
passage
any
more!
He
told
how
he
went
back
for
Becky
and
broke
the
good
news
and
she
told
him
not
to
fret
her
with
such
stuff,
for
she
was
tired,
and
knew
she
was
going
to
die,
and
wanted
to.
He
described
how
he
labored
with
her
and
convinced
her;
and
how
she
almost
died
for
joy
when
she
had
groped
to
where
she
actually
saw
the
blue
speck
of
daylight;
how
he
pushed
his
way
out
at
the
hole
and
then
helped
her
out;
how
they
sat
there
and
cried
for
gladness;
how
some
men
came
along
in
a
skiff
and
Tom
hailed
them
and
told
them
their
situation
and
their
famished
condition;
how
the
men
didn't
believe
the
wild
tale
at
first,
"because,"
said
they,
"you
are
five
miles
down
the
river
below
the
valley
the
cave
is
in"
--then
took
them
aboard,
rowed
to
a
house,
gave
them
supper,
made
them
rest
till
two
or
three
hours
after
dark
and
then
brought
them
home.
Before
day-dawn,
Judge
Thatcher
and
the
handful
of
searchers
with
him
were
tracked
out,
in
the
cave,
by
the
twine
clews
they
had
strung
behind
them,
and
informed
of
the
great
news.
Three
days
and
nights
of
toil
and
hunger
in
the
cave
were
not
to
be
shaken
off
at
once,
as
Tom
and
Becky
soon
discovered.
They
were
bedridden
all
of
Wednesday
and
Thursday,
and
seemed
to
grow
more
and
more
tired
and
worn,
all
the
time.
Tom
got
about,
a
little,
on
Thursday,
was
down-town
Friday,
and
nearly
as
whole
as
ever
Saturday;
but
Becky
did
not
leave
her
room
until
Sunday,
and
then
she
looked
as
if
she
had
passed
through
a
wasting
illness.
Tom
learned
of
Huck's
sickness
and
went
to
see
him
on
Friday,
but
could
not
be
admitted
to
the
bedroom;
neither
could
he
on
Saturday
or
Sunday.
He
was
admitted
daily
after
that,
but
was
warned
to
keep
still
about
his
adventure
and
introduce
no
exciting
topic.
The
Widow
Douglas
stayed
by
to
see
that
he
obeyed.
At
home
Tom
learned
of
the
Cardiff
Hill
event;
also
that
the
"ragged
man's"
body
had
eventually
been
found
in
the
river
near
the
ferry-landing;
he
had
been
drowned
while
trying
to
escape,
perhaps.
About
a
fortnight
after
Tom's
rescue
from
the
cave,
he
started
off
to
visit
Huck,
who
had
grown
plenty
strong
enough,
now,
to
hear
exciting
talk,
and
Tom
had
some
that
would
interest
him,
he
thought.
Judge
Thatcher's
house
was
on
Tom's
way,
and
he
stopped
to
see
Becky.
The
Judge
and
some
friends
set
Tom
to
talking,
and
some
one
asked
him
ironically
if
he
wouldn't
like
to
go
to
the
cave
again.
Tom
said
he
thought
he
wouldn't
mind
it.
The
Judge
said:
"Well,
there
are
others
just
like
you,
Tom,
I've
not
the
least
doubt.
But
we
have
taken
care
of
that.
Nobody
will
get
lost
in
that
cave
any
more."
"Why?"
"Because
I
had
its
big
door
sheathed
with
boiler
iron
two
weeks
ago,
and
triple-locked--and
I've
got
the
keys."
Tom
turned
as
white
as
a
sheet.
"What's
the
matter,
boy!
Here,
run,
somebody!
Fetch
a
glass
of
water!"
The
water
was
brought
and
thrown
into
Tom's
face.
"Ah,
now
you're
all
right.
What
was
the
matter
with
you,
Tom?"
"Oh,
Judge,
Injun
Joe's
in
the
cave!"
CHAPTER
XXXIII
WITHIN
a
few
minutes
the
news
had
spread,
and
a
dozen
skiff-loads
of
men
were
on
their
way
to
McDougal's
cave,
and
the
ferryboat,
well
filled
with
passengers,
soon
followed.
Tom
Sawyer
was
in
the
skiff
that
bore
Judge
Thatcher.
When
the
cave
door
was
unlocked,
a
sorrowful
sight
presented
itself
in
the
dim
twilight
of
the
place.
Injun
Joe
lay
stretched
upon
the
ground,
dead,
with
his
face
close
to
the
crack
of
the
door,
as
if
his
longing
eyes
had
been
fixed,
to
the
latest
moment,
upon
the
light
and
the
cheer
of
the
free
world
outside.
Tom
was
touched,
for
he
knew
by
his
own
experience
how
this
wretch
had
suffered.
His
pity
was
moved,
but
nevertheless
he
felt
an
abounding
sense
of
relief
and
security,
now,
which
revealed
to
him
in
a
degree
which
he
had
not
fully
appreciated
before
how
vast
a
weight
of
dread
had
been
lying
upon
him
since
the
day
he
lifted
his
voice
against
this
bloody-minded
outcast.
Injun
Joe's
bowie-knife
lay
close
by,
its
blade
broken
in
two.
The
great
foundation-beam
of
the
door
had
been
chipped
and
hacked
through,
with
tedious
labor;
useless
labor,
too,
it
was,
for
the
native
rock
formed
a
sill
outside
it,
and
upon
that
stubborn
material
the
knife
had
wrought
no
effect;
the
only
damage
done
was
to
the
knife
itself.
But
if
there
had
been
no
stony
obstruction
there
the
labor
would
have
been
useless
still,
for
if
the
beam
had
been
wholly
cut
away
Injun
Joe
could
not
have
squeezed
his
body
under
the
door,
and
he
knew
it.
So
he
had
only
hacked
that
place
in
order
to
be
doing
something--in
order
to
pass
the
weary
time--in
order
to
employ
his
tortured
faculties.
Ordinarily
one
could
find
half
a
dozen
bits
of
candle
stuck
around
in
the
crevices
of
this
vestibule,
left
there
by
tourists;
but
there
were
none
now.
The
prisoner
had
searched
them
out
and
eaten
them.
He
had
also
contrived
to
catch
a
few
bats,
and
these,
also,
he
had
eaten,
leaving
only
their
claws.
The
poor
unfortunate
had
starved
to
death.
In
one
place,
near
at
hand,
a
stalagmite
had
been
slowly
growing
up
from
the
ground
for
ages,
builded
by
the
water-drip
from
a
stalactite
overhead.
The
captive
had
broken
off
the
stalagmite,
and
upon
the
stump
had
placed
a
stone,
wherein
he
had
scooped
a
shallow
hollow
to
catch
the
precious
drop
that
fell
once
in
every
three
minutes
with
the
dreary
regularity
of
a
clock-tick--a
dessertspoonful
once
in
four
and
twenty
hours.
That
drop
was
falling
when
the
Pyramids
were
new;
when
Troy
fell;
when
the
foundations
of
Rome
were
laid
when
Christ
was
crucified;
when
the
Conqueror
created
the
British
empire;
when
Columbus
sailed;
when
the
massacre
at
Lexington
was
"news."
It
is
falling
now;
it
will
still
be
falling
when
all
these
things
shall
have
sunk
down
the
afternoon
of
history,
and
the
twilight
of
tradition,
and
been
swallowed
up
in
the
thick
night
of
oblivion.
Has
everything
a
purpose
and
a
mission?
Did
this
drop
fall
patiently
during
five
thousand
years
to
be
ready
for
this
flitting
human
insect's
need?
and
has
it
another
important
object
to
accomplish
ten
thousand
years
to
come?
No
matter.
It
is
many
and
many
a
year
since
the
hapless
half-breed
scooped
out
the
stone
to
catch
the
priceless
drops,
but
to
this
day
the
tourist
stares
longest
at
that
pathetic
stone
and
that
slow-dropping
water
when
he
comes
to
see
the
wonders
of
McDougal's
cave.
Injun
Joe's
cup
stands
first
in
the
list
of
the
cavern's
marvels;
even
"Aladdin's
Palace"
cannot
rival
it.
Injun
Joe
was
buried
near
the
mouth
of
the
cave;
and
people
flocked
there
in
boats
and
wagons
from
the
towns
and
from
all
the
farms
and
hamlets
for
seven
miles
around;
they
brought
their
children,
and
all
sorts
of
provisions,
and
confessed
that
they
had
had
almost
as
satisfactory
a
time
at
the
funeral
as
they
could
have
had
at
the
hanging.
This
funeral
stopped
the
further
growth
of
one
thing--the
petition
to
the
governor
for
Injun
Joe's
pardon.
The
petition
had
been
largely
signed;
many
tearful
and
eloquent
meetings
had
been
held,
and
a
committee
of
sappy
women
been
appointed
to
go
in
deep
mourning
and
wail
around
the
governor,
and
implore
him
to
be
a
merciful
ass
and
trample
his
duty
under
foot.
Injun
Joe
was
believed
to
have
killed
five
citizens
of
the
village,
but
what
of
that?
If
he
had
been
Satan
himself
there
would
have
been
plenty
of
weaklings
ready
to
scribble
their
names
to
a
pardon-petition,
and
drip
a
tear
on
it
from
their
permanently
impaired
and
leaky
water-works.
The
morning
after
the
funeral
Tom
took
Huck
to
a
private
place
to
have
an
important
talk.
Huck
had
learned
all
about
Tom's
adventure
from
the
Welshman
and
the
Widow
Douglas,
by
this
time,
but
Tom
said
he
reckoned
there
was
one
thing
they
had
not
told
him;
that
thing
was
what
he
wanted
to
talk
about
now.
Huck's
face
saddened.
He
said:
"I
know
what
it
is.
You
got
into
No.
2
and
never
found
anything
but
whiskey.
Nobody
told
me
it
was
you;
but
I
just
knowed
it
must
'a'
ben
you,
soon
as
I
heard
'bout
that
whiskey
business;
and
I
knowed
you
hadn't
got
the
money
becuz
you'd
'a'
got
at
me
some
way
or
other
and
told
me
even
if
you
was
mum
to
everybody
else.
Tom,
something's
always
told
me
we'd
never
get
holt
of
that
swag."
"Why,
Huck,
I
never
told
on
that
tavern-keeper.
YOU
know
his
tavern
was
all
right
the
Saturday
I
went
to
the
picnic.
Don't
you
remember
you
was
to
watch
there
that
night?"
"Oh
yes!
Why,
it
seems
'bout
a
year
ago.
It
was
that
very
night
that
I
follered
Injun
Joe
to
the
widder's."
"YOU
followed
him?"
"Yes--but
you
keep
mum.
I
reckon
Injun
Joe's
left
friends
behind
him,
and
I
don't
want
'em
souring
on
me
and
doing
me
mean
tricks.
If
it
hadn't
ben
for
me
he'd
be
down
in
Texas
now,
all
right."
Then
Huck
told
his
entire
adventure
in
confidence
to
Tom,
who
had
only
heard
of
the
Welshman's
part
of
it
before.
"Well,"
said
Huck,
presently,
coming
back
to
the
main
question,
"whoever
nipped
the
whiskey
in
No.
2,
nipped
the
money,
too,
I
reckon
--anyways
it's
a
goner
for
us,
Tom."
"Huck,
that
money
wasn't
ever
in
No.
2!"
"What!"
Huck
searched
his
comrade's
face
keenly.
"Tom,
have
you
got
on
the
track
of
that
money
again?"
"Huck,
it's
in
the
cave!"
Huck's
eyes
blazed.
"Say
it
again,
Tom."
"The
money's
in
the
cave!"
"Tom--honest
injun,
now--is
it
fun,
or
earnest?"
"Earnest,
Huck--just
as
earnest
as
ever
I
was
in
my
life.
Will
you
go
in
there
with
me
and
help
get
it
out?"
"I
bet
I
will!
I
will
if
it's
where
we
can
blaze
our
way
to
it
and
not
get
lost."
"Huck,
we
can
do
that
without
the
least
little
bit
of
trouble
in
the
world."
"Good
as
wheat!
What
makes
you
think
the
money's--"
"Huck,
you
just
wait
till
we
get
in
there.
If
we
don't
find
it
I'll
agree
to
give
you
my
drum
and
every
thing
I've
got
in
the
world.
I
will,
by
jings."
"All
right--it's
a
whiz.
When
do
you
say?"
"Right
now,
if
you
say
it.
Are
you
strong
enough?"
"Is
it
far
in
the
cave?
I
ben
on
my
pins
a
little,
three
or
four
days,
now,
but
I
can't
walk
more'n
a
mile,
Tom--least
I
don't
think
I
could."
"It's
about
five
mile
into
there
the
way
anybody
but
me
would
go,
Huck,
but
there's
a
mighty
short
cut
that
they
don't
anybody
but
me
know
about.
Huck,
I'll
take
you
right
to
it
in
a
skiff.
I'll
float
the
skiff
down
there,
and
I'll
pull
it
back
again
all
by
myself.
You
needn't
ever
turn
your
hand
over."
"Less
start
right
off,
Tom."
"All
right.
We
want
some
bread
and
meat,
and
our
pipes,
and
a
little
bag
or
two,
and
two
or
three
kite-strings,
and
some
of
these
new-fangled
things
they
call
lucifer
matches.
I
tell
you,
many's
the
time
I
wished
I
had
some
when
I
was
in
there
before."
A
trifle
after
noon
the
boys
borrowed
a
small
skiff
from
a
citizen
who
was
absent,
and
got
under
way
at
once.
When
they
were
several
miles
below
"Cave
Hollow,"
Tom
said:
"Now
you
see
this
bluff
here
looks
all
alike
all
the
way
down
from
the
cave
hollow--no
houses,
no
wood-yards,
bushes
all
alike.
But
do
you
see
that
white
place
up
yonder
where
there's
been
a
landslide?
Well,
that's
one
of
my
marks.
We'll
get
ashore,
now."
They
landed.
"Now,
Huck,
where
we're
a-standing
you
could
touch
that
hole
I
got
out
of
with
a
fishing-pole.
See
if
you
can
find
it."
Huck
searched
all
the
place
about,
and
found
nothing.
Tom
proudly
marched
into
a
thick
clump
of
sumach
bushes
and
said:
"Here
you
are!
Look
at
it,
Huck;
it's
the
snuggest
hole
in
this
country.
You
just
keep
mum
about
it.
All
along
I've
been
wanting
to
be
a
robber,
but
I
knew
I'd
got
to
have
a
thing
like
this,
and
where
to
run
across
it
was
the
bother.
We've
got
it
now,
and
we'll
keep
it
quiet,
only
we'll
let
Joe
Harper
and
Ben
Rogers
in--because
of
course
there's
got
to
be
a
Gang,
or
else
there
wouldn't
be
any
style
about
it.
Tom
Sawyer's
Gang--it
sounds
splendid,
don't
it,
Huck?"
"Well,
it
just
does,
Tom.
And
who'll
we
rob?"
"Oh,
most
anybody.
Waylay
people--that's
mostly
the
way."
"And
kill
them?"
"No,
not
always.
Hive
them
in
the
cave
till
they
raise
a
ransom."
"What's
a
ransom?"
"Money.
You
make
them
raise
all
they
can,
off'n
their
friends;
and
after
you've
kept
them
a
year,
if
it
ain't
raised
then
you
kill
them.
That's
the
general
way.
Only
you
don't
kill
the
women.
You
shut
up
the
women,
but
you
don't
kill
them.
They're
always
beautiful
and
rich,
and
awfully
scared.
You
take
their
watches
and
things,
but
you
always
take
your
hat
off
and
talk
polite.
They
ain't
anybody
as
polite
as
robbers
--you'll
see
that
in
any
book.
Well,
the
women
get
to
loving
you,
and
after
they've
been
in
the
cave
a
week
or
two
weeks
they
stop
crying
and
after
that
you
couldn't
get
them
to
leave.
If
you
drove
them
out
they'd
turn
right
around
and
come
back.
It's
so
in
all
the
books."
"Why,
it's
real
bully,
Tom.
I
believe
it's
better'n
to
be
a
pirate."
"Yes,
it's
better
in
some
ways,
because
it's
close
to
home
and
circuses
and
all
that."
By
this
time
everything
was
ready
and
the
boys
entered
the
hole,
Tom
in
the
lead.
They
toiled
their
way
to
the
farther
end
of
the
tunnel,
then
made
their
spliced
kite-strings
fast
and
moved
on.
A
few
steps
brought
them
to
the
spring,
and
Tom
felt
a
shudder
quiver
all
through
him.
He
showed
Huck
the
fragment
of
candle-wick
perched
on
a
lump
of
clay
against
the
wall,
and
described
how
he
and
Becky
had
watched
the
flame
struggle
and
expire.
The
boys
began
to
quiet
down
to
whispers,
now,
for
the
stillness
and
gloom
of
the
place
oppressed
their
spirits.
They
went
on,
and
presently
entered
and
followed
Tom's
other
corridor
until
they
reached
the
"jumping-off
place."
The
candles
revealed
the
fact
that
it
was
not
really
a
precipice,
but
only
a
steep
clay
hill
twenty
or
thirty
feet
high.
Tom
whispered:
"Now
I'll
show
you
something,
Huck."
He
held
his
candle
aloft
and
said:
"Look
as
far
around
the
corner
as
you
can.
Do
you
see
that?
There--on
the
big
rock
over
yonder--done
with
candle-smoke."
"Tom,
it's
a
CROSS!"
"NOW
where's
your
Number
Two?
'UNDER
THE
CROSS,'
hey?
Right
yonder's
where
I
saw
Injun
Joe
poke
up
his
candle,
Huck!"
Huck
stared
at
the
mystic
sign
awhile,
and
then
said
with
a
shaky
voice:
"Tom,
less
git
out
of
here!"
"What!
and
leave
the
treasure?"
"Yes--leave
it.
Injun
Joe's
ghost
is
round
about
there,
certain."
"No
it
ain't,
Huck,
no
it
ain't.
It
would
ha'nt
the
place
where
he
died--away
out
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave--five
mile
from
here."
"No,
Tom,
it
wouldn't.
It
would
hang
round
the
money.
I
know
the
ways
of
ghosts,
and
so
do
you."
Tom
began
to
fear
that
Huck
was
right.
Misgivings
gathered
in
his
mind.
But
presently
an
idea
occurred
to
him--
"Lookyhere,
Huck,
what
fools
we're
making
of
ourselves!
Injun
Joe's
ghost
ain't
a
going
to
come
around
where
there's
a
cross!"
The
point
was
well
taken.
It
had
its
effect.
"Tom,
I
didn't
think
of
that.
But
that's
so.
It's
luck
for
us,
that
cross
is.
I
reckon
we'll
climb
down
there
and
have
a
hunt
for
that
box."
Tom
went
first,
cutting
rude
steps
in
the
clay
hill
as
he
descended.
Huck
followed.
Four
avenues
opened
out
of
the
small
cavern
which
the
great
rock
stood
in.
The
boys
examined
three
of
them
with
no
result.
They
found
a
small
recess
in
the
one
nearest
the
base
of
the
rock,
with
a
pallet
of
blankets
spread
down
in
it;
also
an
old
suspender,
some
bacon
rind,
and
the
well-gnawed
bones
of
two
or
three
fowls.
But
there
was
no
money-box.
The
lads
searched
and
researched
this
place,
but
in
vain.
Tom
said:
"He
said
UNDER
the
cross.
Well,
this
comes
nearest
to
being
under
the
cross.
It
can't
be
under
the
rock
itself,
because
that
sets
solid
on
the
ground."
They
searched
everywhere
once
more,
and
then
sat
down
discouraged.
Huck
could
suggest
nothing.
By-and-by
Tom
said:
"Lookyhere,
Huck,
there's
footprints
and
some
candle-grease
on
the
clay
about
one
side
of
this
rock,
but
not
on
the
other
sides.
Now,
what's
that
for?
I
bet
you
the
money
IS
under
the
rock.
I'm
going
to
dig
in
the
clay."
"That
ain't
no
bad
notion,
Tom!"
said
Huck
with
animation.
Tom's
"real
Barlow"
was
out
at
once,
and
he
had
not
dug
four
inches
before
he
struck
wood.
"Hey,
Huck!--you
hear
that?"
Huck
began
to
dig
and
scratch
now.
Some
boards
were
soon
uncovered
and
removed.
They
had
concealed
a
natural
chasm
which
led
under
the
rock.
Tom
got
into
this
and
held
his
candle
as
far
under
the
rock
as
he
could,
but
said
he
could
not
see
to
the
end
of
the
rift.
He
proposed
to
explore.
He
stooped
and
passed
under;
the
narrow
way
descended
gradually.
He
followed
its
winding
course,
first
to
the
right,
then
to
the
left,
Huck
at
his
heels.
Tom
turned
a
short
curve,
by-and-by,
and
exclaimed:
"My
goodness,
Huck,
lookyhere!"
It
was
the
treasure-box,
sure
enough,
occupying
a
snug
little
cavern,
along
with
an
empty
powder-keg,
a
couple
of
guns
in
leather
cases,
two
or
three
pairs
of
old
moccasins,
a
leather
belt,
and
some
other
rubbish
well
soaked
with
the
water-drip.
"Got
it
at
last!"
said
Huck,
ploughing
among
the
tarnished
coins
with
his
hand.
"My,
but
we're
rich,
Tom!"
"Huck,
I
always
reckoned
we'd
get
it.
It's
just
too
good
to
believe,
but
we
HAVE
got
it,
sure!
Say--let's
not
fool
around
here.
Let's
snake
it
out.
Lemme
see
if
I
can
lift
the
box."
It
weighed
about
fifty
pounds.
Tom
could
lift
it,
after
an
awkward
fashion,
but
could
not
carry
it
conveniently.
"I
thought
so,"
he
said;
"THEY
carried
it
like
it
was
heavy,
that
day
at
the
ha'nted
house.
I
noticed
that.
I
reckon
I
was
right
to
think
of
fetching
the
little
bags
along."
The
money
was
soon
in
the
bags
and
the
boys
took
it
up
to
the
cross
rock.
"Now
less
fetch
the
guns
and
things,"
said
Huck.
"No,
Huck--leave
them
there.
They're
just
the
tricks
to
have
when
we
go
to
robbing.
We'll
keep
them
there
all
the
time,
and
we'll
hold
our
orgies
there,
too.
It's
an
awful
snug
place
for
orgies."
"What
orgies?"
"I
dono.
But
robbers
always
have
orgies,
and
of
course
we've
got
to
have
them,
too.
Come
along,
Huck,
we've
been
in
here
a
long
time.
It's
getting
late,
I
reckon.
I'm
hungry,
too.
We'll
eat
and
smoke
when
we
get
to
the
skiff."
They
presently
emerged
into
the
clump
of
sumach
bushes,
looked
warily
out,
found
the
coast
clear,
and
were
soon
lunching
and
smoking
in
the
skiff.
As
the
sun
dipped
toward
the
horizon
they
pushed
out
and
got
under
way.
Tom
skimmed
up
the
shore
through
the
long
twilight,
chatting
cheerily
with
Huck,
and
landed
shortly
after
dark.
"Now,
Huck,"
said
Tom,
"we'll
hide
the
money
in
the
loft
of
the
widow's
woodshed,
and
I'll
come
up
in
the
morning
and
we'll
count
it
and
divide,
and
then
we'll
hunt
up
a
place
out
in
the
woods
for
it
where
it
will
be
safe.
Just
you
lay
quiet
here
and
watch
the
stuff
till
I
run
and
hook
Benny
Taylor's
little
wagon;
I
won't
be
gone
a
minute."
He
disappeared,
and
presently
returned
with
the
wagon,
put
the
two
small
sacks
into
it,
threw
some
old
rags
on
top
of
them,
and
started
off,
dragging
his
cargo
behind
him.
When
the
boys
reached
the
Welshman's
house,
they
stopped
to
rest.
Just
as
they
were
about
to
move
on,
the
Welshman
stepped
out
and
said:
"Hallo,
who's
that?"
"Huck
and
Tom
Sawyer."
"Good!
Come
along
with
me,
boys,
you
are
keeping
everybody
waiting.
Here--hurry
up,
trot
ahead--I'll
haul
the
wagon
for
you.
Why,
it's
not
as
light
as
it
might
be.
Got
bricks
in
it?--or
old
metal?"
"Old
metal,"
said
Tom.
"I
judged
so;
the
boys
in
this
town
will
take
more
trouble
and
fool
away
more
time
hunting
up
six
bits'
worth
of
old
iron
to
sell
to
the
foundry
than
they
would
to
make
twice
the
money
at
regular
work.
But
that's
human
nature--hurry
along,
hurry
along!"
The
boys
wanted
to
know
what
the
hurry
was
about.
"Never
mind;
you'll
see,
when
we
get
to
the
Widow
Douglas'."
Huck
said
with
some
apprehension--for
he
was
long
used
to
being
falsely
accused:
"Mr.
Jones,
we
haven't
been
doing
nothing."
The
Welshman
laughed.
"Well,
I
don't
know,
Huck,
my
boy.
I
don't
know
about
that.
Ain't
you
and
the
widow
good
friends?"
"Yes.
Well,
she's
ben
good
friends
to
me,
anyway."
"All
right,
then.
What
do
you
want
to
be
afraid
for?"
This
question
was
not
entirely
answered
in
Huck's
slow
mind
before
he
found
himself
pushed,
along
with
Tom,
into
Mrs.
Douglas'
drawing-room.
Mr.
Jones
left
the
wagon
near
the
door
and
followed.
The
place
was
grandly
lighted,
and
everybody
that
was
of
any
consequence
in
the
village
was
there.
The
Thatchers
were
there,
the
Harpers,
the
Rogerses,
Aunt
Polly,
Sid,
Mary,
the
minister,
the
editor,
and
a
great
many
more,
and
all
dressed
in
their
best.
The
widow
received
the
boys
as
heartily
as
any
one
could
well
receive
two
such
looking
beings.
They
were
covered
with
clay
and
candle-grease.
Aunt
Polly
blushed
crimson
with
humiliation,
and
frowned
and
shook
her
head
at
Tom.
Nobody
suffered
half
as
much
as
the
two
boys
did,
however.
Mr.
Jones
said:
"Tom
wasn't
at
home,
yet,
so
I
gave
him
up;
but
I
stumbled
on
him
and
Huck
right
at
my
door,
and
so
I
just
brought
them
along
in
a
hurry."
"And
you
did
just
right,"
said
the
widow.
"Come
with
me,
boys."
She
took
them
to
a
bedchamber
and
said:
"Now
wash
and
dress
yourselves.
Here
are
two
new
suits
of
clothes
--shirts,
socks,
everything
complete.
They're
Huck's--no,
no
thanks,
Huck--Mr.
Jones
bought
one
and
I
the
other.
But
they'll
fit
both
of
you.
Get
into
them.
We'll
wait--come
down
when
you
are
slicked
up
enough."
Then
she
left.
CHAPTER
XXXIV
HUCK
said:
"Tom,
we
can
slope,
if
we
can
find
a
rope.
The
window
ain't
high
from
the
ground."
"Shucks!
what
do
you
want
to
slope
for?"
"Well,
I
ain't
used
to
that
kind
of
a
crowd.
I
can't
stand
it.
I
ain't
going
down
there,
Tom."
"Oh,
bother!
It
ain't
anything.
I
don't
mind
it
a
bit.
I'll
take
care
of
you."
Sid
appeared.
"Tom,"
said
he,
"auntie
has
been
waiting
for
you
all
the
afternoon.
Mary
got
your
Sunday
clothes
ready,
and
everybody's
been
fretting
about
you.
Say--ain't
this
grease
and
clay,
on
your
clothes?"
"Now,
Mr.
Siddy,
you
jist
'tend
to
your
own
business.
What's
all
this
blow-out
about,
anyway?"
"It's
one
of
the
widow's
parties
that
she's
always
having.
This
time
it's
for
the
Welshman
and
his
sons,
on
account
of
that
scrape
they
helped
her
out
of
the
other
night.
And
say--I
can
tell
you
something,
if
you
want
to
know."
"Well,
what?"
"Why,
old
Mr.
Jones
is
going
to
try
to
spring
something
on
the
people
here
to-night,
but
I
overheard
him
tell
auntie
to-day
about
it,
as
a
secret,
but
I
reckon
it's
not
much
of
a
secret
now.
Everybody
knows
--the
widow,
too,
for
all
she
tries
to
let
on
she
don't.
Mr.
Jones
was
bound
Huck
should
be
here--couldn't
get
along
with
his
grand
secret
without
Huck,
you
know!"
"Secret
about
what,
Sid?"
"About
Huck
tracking
the
robbers
to
the
widow's.
I
reckon
Mr.
Jones
was
going
to
make
a
grand
time
over
his
surprise,
but
I
bet
you
it
will
drop
pretty
flat."
Sid
chuckled
in
a
very
contented
and
satisfied
way.
"Sid,
was
it
you
that
told?"
"Oh,
never
mind
who
it
was.
SOMEBODY
told--that's
enough."
"Sid,
there's
only
one
person
in
this
town
mean
enough
to
do
that,
and
that's
you.
If
you
had
been
in
Huck's
place
you'd
'a'
sneaked
down
the
hill
and
never
told
anybody
on
the
robbers.
You
can't
do
any
but
mean
things,
and
you
can't
bear
to
see
anybody
praised
for
doing
good
ones.
There--no
thanks,
as
the
widow
says"--and
Tom
cuffed
Sid's
ears
and
helped
him
to
the
door
with
several
kicks.
"Now
go
and
tell
auntie
if
you
dare--and
to-morrow
you'll
catch
it!"
Some
minutes
later
the
widow's
guests
were
at
the
supper-table,
and
a
dozen
children
were
propped
up
at
little
side-tables
in
the
same
room,
after
the
fashion
of
that
country
and
that
day.
At
the
proper
time
Mr.
Jones
made
his
little
speech,
in
which
he
thanked
the
widow
for
the
honor
she
was
doing
himself
and
his
sons,
but
said
that
there
was
another
person
whose
modesty--
And
so
forth
and
so
on.
He
sprung
his
secret
about
Huck's
share
in
the
adventure
in
the
finest
dramatic
manner
he
was
master
of,
but
the
surprise
it
occasioned
was
largely
counterfeit
and
not
as
clamorous
and
effusive
as
it
might
have
been
under
happier
circumstances.
However,
the
widow
made
a
pretty
fair
show
of
astonishment,
and
heaped
so
many
compliments
and
so
much
gratitude
upon
Huck
that
he
almost
forgot
the
nearly
intolerable
discomfort
of
his
new
clothes
in
the
entirely
intolerable
discomfort
of
being
set
up
as
a
target
for
everybody's
gaze
and
everybody's
laudations.
The
widow
said
she
meant
to
give
Huck
a
home
under
her
roof
and
have
him
educated;
and
that
when
she
could
spare
the
money
she
would
start
him
in
business
in
a
modest
way.
Tom's
chance
was
come.
He
said:
"Huck
don't
need
it.
Huck's
rich."
Nothing
but
a
heavy
strain
upon
the
good
manners
of
the
company
kept
back
the
due
and
proper
complimentary
laugh
at
this
pleasant
joke.
But
the
silence
was
a
little
awkward.
Tom
broke
it:
"Huck's
got
money.
Maybe
you
don't
believe
it,
but
he's
got
lots
of
it.
Oh,
you
needn't
smile--I
reckon
I
can
show
you.
You
just
wait
a
minute."
Tom
ran
out
of
doors.
The
company
looked
at
each
other
with
a
perplexed
interest--and
inquiringly
at
Huck,
who
was
tongue-tied.
"Sid,
what
ails
Tom?"
said
Aunt
Polly.
"He--well,
there
ain't
ever
any
making
of
that
boy
out.
I
never--"
Tom
entered,
struggling
with
the
weight
of
his
sacks,
and
Aunt
Polly
did
not
finish
her
sentence.
Tom
poured
the
mass
of
yellow
coin
upon
the
table
and
said:
"There--what
did
I
tell
you?
Half
of
it's
Huck's
and
half
of
it's
mine!"
The
spectacle
took
the
general
breath
away.
All
gazed,
nobody
spoke
for
a
moment.
Then
there
was
a
unanimous
call
for
an
explanation.
Tom
said
he
could
furnish
it,
and
he
did.
The
tale
was
long,
but
brimful
of
interest.
There
was
scarcely
an
interruption
from
any
one
to
break
the
charm
of
its
flow.
When
he
had
finished,
Mr.
Jones
said:
"I
thought
I
had
fixed
up
a
little
surprise
for
this
occasion,
but
it
don't
amount
to
anything
now.
This
one
makes
it
sing
mighty
small,
I'm
willing
to
allow."
The
money
was
counted.
The
sum
amounted
to
a
little
over
twelve
thousand
dollars.
It
was
more
than
any
one
present
had
ever
seen
at
one
time
before,
though
several
persons
were
there
who
were
worth
considerably
more
than
that
in
property.
CHAPTER
XXXV
THE
reader
may
rest
satisfied
that
Tom's
and
Huck's
windfall
made
a
mighty
stir
in
the
poor
little
village
of
St.
Petersburg.
So
vast
a
sum,
all
in
actual
cash,
seemed
next
to
incredible.
It
was
talked
about,
gloated
over,
glorified,
until
the
reason
of
many
of
the
citizens
tottered
under
the
strain
of
the
unhealthy
excitement.
Every
"haunted"
house
in
St.
Petersburg
and
the
neighboring
villages
was
dissected,
plank
by
plank,
and
its
foundations
dug
up
and
ransacked
for
hidden
treasure--and
not
by
boys,
but
men--pretty
grave,
unromantic
men,
too,
some
of
them.
Wherever
Tom
and
Huck
appeared
they
were
courted,
admired,
stared
at.
The
boys
were
not
able
to
remember
that
their
remarks
had
possessed
weight
before;
but
now
their
sayings
were
treasured
and
repeated;
everything
they
did
seemed
somehow
to
be
regarded
as
remarkable;
they
had
evidently
lost
the
power
of
doing
and
saying
commonplace
things;
moreover,
their
past
history
was
raked
up
and
discovered
to
bear
marks
of
conspicuous
originality.
The
village
paper
published
biographical
sketches
of
the
boys.
The
Widow
Douglas
put
Huck's
money
out
at
six
per
cent.,
and
Judge
Thatcher
did
the
same
with
Tom's
at
Aunt
Polly's
request.
Each
lad
had
an
income,
now,
that
was
simply
prodigious--a
dollar
for
every
week-day
in
the
year
and
half
of
the
Sundays.
It
was
just
what
the
minister
got
--no,
it
was
what
he
was
promised--he
generally
couldn't
collect
it.
A
dollar
and
a
quarter
a
week
would
board,
lodge,
and
school
a
boy
in
those
old
simple
days--and
clothe
him
and
wash
him,
too,
for
that
matter.
Judge
Thatcher
had
conceived
a
great
opinion
of
Tom.
He
said
that
no
commonplace
boy
would
ever
have
got
his
daughter
out
of
the
cave.
When
Becky
told
her
father,
in
strict
confidence,
how
Tom
had
taken
her
whipping
at
school,
the
Judge
was
visibly
moved;
and
when
she
pleaded
grace
for
the
mighty
lie
which
Tom
had
told
in
order
to
shift
that
whipping
from
her
shoulders
to
his
own,
the
Judge
said
with
a
fine
outburst
that
it
was
a
noble,
a
generous,
a
magnanimous
lie--a
lie
that
was
worthy
to
hold
up
its
head
and
march
down
through
history
breast
to
breast
with
George
Washington's
lauded
Truth
about
the
hatchet!
Becky
thought
her
father
had
never
looked
so
tall
and
so
superb
as
when
he
walked
the
floor
and
stamped
his
foot
and
said
that.
She
went
straight
off
and
told
Tom
about
it.
Judge
Thatcher
hoped
to
see
Tom
a
great
lawyer
or
a
great
soldier
some
day.
He
said
he
meant
to
look
to
it
that
Tom
should
be
admitted
to
the
National
Military
Academy
and
afterward
trained
in
the
best
law
school
in
the
country,
in
order
that
he
might
be
ready
for
either
career
or
both.
Huck
Finn's
wealth
and
the
fact
that
he
was
now
under
the
Widow
Douglas'
protection
introduced
him
into
society--no,
dragged
him
into
it,
hurled
him
into
it--and
his
sufferings
were
almost
more
than
he
could
bear.
The
widow's
servants
kept
him
clean
and
neat,
combed
and
brushed,
and
they
bedded
him
nightly
in
unsympathetic
sheets
that
had
not
one
little
spot
or
stain
which
he
could
press
to
his
heart
and
know
for
a
friend.
He
had
to
eat
with
a
knife
and
fork;
he
had
to
use
napkin,
cup,
and
plate;
he
had
to
learn
his
book,
he
had
to
go
to
church;
he
had
to
talk
so
properly
that
speech
was
become
insipid
in
his
mouth;
whithersoever
he
turned,
the
bars
and
shackles
of
civilization
shut
him
in
and
bound
him
hand
and
foot.
He
bravely
bore
his
miseries
three
weeks,
and
then
one
day
turned
up
missing.
For
forty-eight
hours
the
widow
hunted
for
him
everywhere
in
great
distress.
The
public
were
profoundly
concerned;
they
searched
high
and
low,
they
dragged
the
river
for
his
body.
Early
the
third
morning
Tom
Sawyer
wisely
went
poking
among
some
old
empty
hogsheads
down
behind
the
abandoned
slaughter-house,
and
in
one
of
them
he
found
the
refugee.
Huck
had
slept
there;
he
had
just
breakfasted
upon
some
stolen
odds
and
ends
of
food,
and
was
lying
off,
now,
in
comfort,
with
his
pipe.
He
was
unkempt,
uncombed,
and
clad
in
the
same
old
ruin
of
rags
that
had
made
him
picturesque
in
the
days
when
he
was
free
and
happy.
Tom
routed
him
out,
told
him
the
trouble
he
had
been
causing,
and
urged
him
to
go
home.
Huck's
face
lost
its
tranquil
content,
and
took
a
melancholy
cast.
He
said:
"Don't
talk
about
it,
Tom.
I've
tried
it,
and
it
don't
work;
it
don't
work,
Tom.
It
ain't
for
me;
I
ain't
used
to
it.
The
widder's
good
to
me,
and
friendly;
but
I
can't
stand
them
ways.
She
makes
me
get
up
just
at
the
same
time
every
morning;
she
makes
me
wash,
they
comb
me
all
to
thunder;
she
won't
let
me
sleep
in
the
woodshed;
I
got
to
wear
them
blamed
clothes
that
just
smothers
me,
Tom;
they
don't
seem
to
any
air
git
through
'em,
somehow;
and
they're
so
rotten
nice
that
I
can't
set
down,
nor
lay
down,
nor
roll
around
anywher's;
I
hain't
slid
on
a
cellar-door
for--well,
it
'pears
to
be
years;
I
got
to
go
to
church
and
sweat
and
sweat--I
hate
them
ornery
sermons!
I
can't
ketch
a
fly
in
there,
I
can't
chaw.
I
got
to
wear
shoes
all
Sunday.
The
widder
eats
by
a
bell;
she
goes
to
bed
by
a
bell;
she
gits
up
by
a
bell--everything's
so
awful
reg'lar
a
body
can't
stand
it."
"Well,
everybody
does
that
way,
Huck."
"Tom,
it
don't
make
no
difference.
I
ain't
everybody,
and
I
can't
STAND
it.
It's
awful
to
be
tied
up
so.
And
grub
comes
too
easy--I
don't
take
no
interest
in
vittles,
that
way.
I
got
to
ask
to
go
a-fishing;
I
got
to
ask
to
go
in
a-swimming--dern'd
if
I
hain't
got
to
ask
to
do
everything.
Well,
I'd
got
to
talk
so
nice
it
wasn't
no
comfort--I'd
got
to
go
up
in
the
attic
and
rip
out
awhile,
every
day,
to
git
a
taste
in
my
mouth,
or
I'd
a
died,
Tom.
The
widder
wouldn't
let
me
smoke;
she
wouldn't
let
me
yell,
she
wouldn't
let
me
gape,
nor
stretch,
nor
scratch,
before
folks--"
[Then
with
a
spasm
of
special
irritation
and
injury]--"And
dad
fetch
it,
she
prayed
all
the
time!
I
never
see
such
a
woman!
I
HAD
to
shove,
Tom--I
just
had
to.
And
besides,
that
school's
going
to
open,
and
I'd
a
had
to
go
to
it--well,
I
wouldn't
stand
THAT,
Tom.
Looky
here,
Tom,
being
rich
ain't
what
it's
cracked
up
to
be.
It's
just
worry
and
worry,
and
sweat
and
sweat,
and
a-wishing
you
was
dead
all
the
time.
Now
these
clothes
suits
me,
and
this
bar'l
suits
me,
and
I
ain't
ever
going
to
shake
'em
any
more.
Tom,
I
wouldn't
ever
got
into
all
this
trouble
if
it
hadn't
'a'
ben
for
that
money;
now
you
just
take
my
sheer
of
it
along
with
your'n,
and
gimme
a
ten-center
sometimes--not
many
times,
becuz
I
don't
give
a
dern
for
a
thing
'thout
it's
tollable
hard
to
git--and
you
go
and
beg
off
for
me
with
the
widder."
"Oh,
Huck,
you
know
I
can't
do
that.
'Tain't
fair;
and
besides
if
you'll
try
this
thing
just
a
while
longer
you'll
come
to
like
it."
"Like
it!
Yes--the
way
I'd
like
a
hot
stove
if
I
was
to
set
on
it
long
enough.
No,
Tom,
I
won't
be
rich,
and
I
won't
live
in
them
cussed
smothery
houses.
I
like
the
woods,
and
the
river,
and
hogsheads,
and
I'll
stick
to
'em,
too.
Blame
it
all!
just
as
we'd
got
guns,
and
a
cave,
and
all
just
fixed
to
rob,
here
this
dern
foolishness
has
got
to
come
up
and
spile
it
all!"
Tom
saw
his
opportunity--
"Lookyhere,
Huck,
being
rich
ain't
going
to
keep
me
back
from
turning
robber."
"No!
Oh,
good-licks;
are
you
in
real
dead-wood
earnest,
Tom?"
"Just
as
dead
earnest
as
I'm
sitting
here.
But
Huck,
we
can't
let
you
into
the
gang
if
you
ain't
respectable,
you
know."
Huck's
joy
was
quenched.
"Can't
let
me
in,
Tom?
Didn't
you
let
me
go
for
a
pirate?"
"Yes,
but
that's
different.
A
robber
is
more
high-toned
than
what
a
pirate
is--as
a
general
thing.
In
most
countries
they're
awful
high
up
in
the
nobility--dukes
and
such."
"Now,
Tom,
hain't
you
always
ben
friendly
to
me?
You
wouldn't
shet
me
out,
would
you,
Tom?
You
wouldn't
do
that,
now,
WOULD
you,
Tom?"
"Huck,
I
wouldn't
want
to,
and
I
DON'T
want
to--but
what
would
people
say?
Why,
they'd
say,
'Mph!
Tom
Sawyer's
Gang!
pretty
low
characters
in
it!'
They'd
mean
you,
Huck.
You
wouldn't
like
that,
and
I
wouldn't."
Huck
was
silent
for
some
time,
engaged
in
a
mental
struggle.
Finally
he
said:
"Well,
I'll
go
back
to
the
widder
for
a
month
and
tackle
it
and
see
if
I
can
come
to
stand
it,
if
you'll
let
me
b'long
to
the
gang,
Tom."
"All
right,
Huck,
it's
a
whiz!
Come
along,
old
chap,
and
I'll
ask
the
widow
to
let
up
on
you
a
little,
Huck."
"Will
you,
Tom--now
will
you?
That's
good.
If
she'll
let
up
on
some
of
the
roughest
things,
I'll
smoke
private
and
cuss
private,
and
crowd
through
or
bust.
When
you
going
to
start
the
gang
and
turn
robbers?"
"Oh,
right
off.
We'll
get
the
boys
together
and
have
the
initiation
to-night,
maybe."
"Have
the
which?"
"Have
the
initiation."
"What's
that?"
"It's
to
swear
to
stand
by
one
another,
and
never
tell
the
gang's
secrets,
even
if
you're
chopped
all
to
flinders,
and
kill
anybody
and
all
his
family
that
hurts
one
of
the
gang."
"That's
gay--that's
mighty
gay,
Tom,
I
tell
you."
"Well,
I
bet
it
is.
And
all
that
swearing's
got
to
be
done
at
midnight,
in
the
lonesomest,
awfulest
place
you
can
find--a
ha'nted
house
is
the
best,
but
they're
all
ripped
up
now."
"Well,
midnight's
good,
anyway,
Tom."
"Yes,
so
it
is.
And
you've
got
to
swear
on
a
coffin,
and
sign
it
with
blood."
"Now,
that's
something
LIKE!
Why,
it's
a
million
times
bullier
than
pirating.
I'll
stick
to
the
widder
till
I
rot,
Tom;
and
if
I
git
to
be
a
reg'lar
ripper
of
a
robber,
and
everybody
talking
'bout
it,
I
reckon
she'll
be
proud
she
snaked
me
in
out
of
the
wet."
CONCLUSION
SO
endeth
this
chronicle.
It
being
strictly
a
history
of
a
BOY,
it
must
stop
here;
the
story
could
not
go
much
further
without
becoming
the
history
of
a
MAN.
When
one
writes
a
novel
about
grown
people,
he
knows
exactly
where
to
stop--that
is,
with
a
marriage;
but
when
he
writes
of
juveniles,
he
must
stop
where
he
best
can.
Most
of
the
characters
that
perform
in
this
book
still
live,
and
are
prosperous
and
happy.
Some
day
it
may
seem
worth
while
to
take
up
the
story
of
the
younger
ones
again
and
see
what
sort
of
men
and
women
they
turned
out
to
be;
therefore
it
will
be
wisest
not
to
reveal
any
of
that
part
of
their
lives
at
present.

ADVENTURE
I.
A
SCANDAL
IN
BOHEMIA
I.
To
Sherlock
Holmes
she
is
always
THE
woman.
I
have
seldom
heard
him
mention
her
under
any
other
name.
In
his
eyes
she
eclipses
and
predominates
the
whole
of
her
sex.
It
was
not
that
he
felt
any
emotion
akin
to
love
for
Irene
Adler.
All
emotions,
and
that
one
particularly,
were
abhorrent
to
his
cold,
precise
but
admirably
balanced
mind.
He
was,
I
take
it,
the
most
perfect
reasoning
and
observing
machine
that
the
world
has
seen,
but
as
a
lover
he
would
have
placed
himself
in
a
false
position.
He
never
spoke
of
the
softer
passions,
save
with
a
gibe
and
a
sneer.
They
were
admirable
things
for
the
observer--excellent
for
drawing
the
veil
from
men's
motives
and
actions.
But
for
the
trained
reasoner
to
admit
such
intrusions
into
his
own
delicate
and
finely
adjusted
temperament
was
to
introduce
a
distracting
factor
which
might
throw
a
doubt
upon
all
his
mental
results.
Grit
in
a
sensitive
instrument,
or
a
crack
in
one
of
his
own
high-power
lenses,
would
not
be
more
disturbing
than
a
strong
emotion
in
a
nature
such
as
his.
And
yet
there
was
but
one
woman
to
him,
and
that
woman
was
the
late
Irene
Adler,
of
dubious
and
questionable
memory.
I
had
seen
little
of
Holmes
lately.
My
marriage
had
drifted
us
away
from
each
other.
My
own
complete
happiness,
and
the
home-centred
interests
which
rise
up
around
the
man
who
first
finds
himself
master
of
his
own
establishment,
were
sufficient
to
absorb
all
my
attention,
while
Holmes,
who
loathed
every
form
of
society
with
his
whole
Bohemian
soul,
remained
in
our
lodgings
in
Baker
Street,
buried
among
his
old
books,
and
alternating
from
week
to
week
between
cocaine
and
ambition,
the
drowsiness
of
the
drug,
and
the
fierce
energy
of
his
own
keen
nature.
He
was
still,
as
ever,
deeply
attracted
by
the
study
of
crime,
and
occupied
his
immense
faculties
and
extraordinary
powers
of
observation
in
following
out
those
clues,
and
clearing
up
those
mysteries
which
had
been
abandoned
as
hopeless
by
the
official
police.
From
time
to
time
I
heard
some
vague
account
of
his
doings:
of
his
summons
to
Odessa
in
the
case
of
the
Trepoff
murder,
of
his
clearing
up
of
the
singular
tragedy
of
the
Atkinson
brothers
at
Trincomalee,
and
finally
of
the
mission
which
he
had
accomplished
so
delicately
and
successfully
for
the
reigning
family
of
Holland.
Beyond
these
signs
of
his
activity,
however,
which
I
merely
shared
with
all
the
readers
of
the
daily
press,
I
knew
little
of
my
former
friend
and
companion.
One
night--it
was
on
the
twentieth
of
March,
1888--I
was
returning
from
a
journey
to
a
patient
(for
I
had
now
returned
to
civil
practice),
when
my
way
led
me
through
Baker
Street.
As
I
passed
the
well-remembered
door,
which
must
always
be
associated
in
my
mind
with
my
wooing,
and
with
the
dark
incidents
of
the
Study
in
Scarlet,
I
was
seized
with
a
keen
desire
to
see
Holmes
again,
and
to
know
how
he
was
employing
his
extraordinary
powers.
His
rooms
were
brilliantly
lit,
and,
even
as
I
looked
up,
I
saw
his
tall,
spare
figure
pass
twice
in
a
dark
silhouette
against
the
blind.
He
was
pacing
the
room
swiftly,
eagerly,
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
chest
and
his
hands
clasped
behind
him.
To
me,
who
knew
his
every
mood
and
habit,
his
attitude
and
manner
told
their
own
story.
He
was
at
work
again.
He
had
risen
out
of
his
drug-created
dreams
and
was
hot
upon
the
scent
of
some
new
problem.
I
rang
the
bell
and
was
shown
up
to
the
chamber
which
had
formerly
been
in
part
my
own.
His
manner
was
not
effusive.
It
seldom
was;
but
he
was
glad,
I
think,
to
see
me.
With
hardly
a
word
spoken,
but
with
a
kindly
eye,
he
waved
me
to
an
armchair,
threw
across
his
case
of
cigars,
and
indicated
a
spirit
case
and
a
gasogene
in
the
corner.
Then
he
stood
before
the
fire
and
looked
me
over
in
his
singular
introspective
fashion.
"Wedlock
suits
you,"
he
remarked.
"I
think,
Watson,
that
you
have
put
on
seven
and
a
half
pounds
since
I
saw
you."
"Seven!"
I
answered.
"Indeed,
I
should
have
thought
a
little
more.
Just
a
trifle
more,
I
fancy,
Watson.
And
in
practice
again,
I
observe.
You
did
not
tell
me
that
you
intended
to
go
into
harness."
"Then,
how
do
you
know?"
"I
see
it,
I
deduce
it.
How
do
I
know
that
you
have
been
getting
yourself
very
wet
lately,
and
that
you
have
a
most
clumsy
and
careless
servant
girl?"
"My
dear
Holmes,"
said
I,
"this
is
too
much.
You
would
certainly
have
been
burned,
had
you
lived
a
few
centuries
ago.
It
is
true
that
I
had
a
country
walk
on
Thursday
and
came
home
in
a
dreadful
mess,
but
as
I
have
changed
my
clothes
I
can't
imagine
how
you
deduce
it.
As
to
Mary
Jane,
she
is
incorrigible,
and
my
wife
has
given
her
notice,
but
there,
again,
I
fail
to
see
how
you
work
it
out."
He
chuckled
to
himself
and
rubbed
his
long,
nervous
hands
together.
"It
is
simplicity
itself,"
said
he;
"my
eyes
tell
me
that
on
the
inside
of
your
left
shoe,
just
where
the
firelight
strikes
it,
the
leather
is
scored
by
six
almost
parallel
cuts.
Obviously
they
have
been
caused
by
someone
who
has
very
carelessly
scraped
round
the
edges
of
the
sole
in
order
to
remove
crusted
mud
from
it.
Hence,
you
see,
my
double
deduction
that
you
had
been
out
in
vile
weather,
and
that
you
had
a
particularly
malignant
boot-slitting
specimen
of
the
London
slavey.
As
to
your
practice,
if
a
gentleman
walks
into
my
rooms
smelling
of
iodoform,
with
a
black
mark
of
nitrate
of
silver
upon
his
right
forefinger,
and
a
bulge
on
the
right
side
of
his
top-hat
to
show
where
he
has
secreted
his
stethoscope,
I
must
be
dull,
indeed,
if
I
do
not
pronounce
him
to
be
an
active
member
of
the
medical
profession."
I
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
ease
with
which
he
explained
his
process
of
deduction.
"When
I
hear
you
give
your
reasons,"
I
remarked,
"the
thing
always
appears
to
me
to
be
so
ridiculously
simple
that
I
could
easily
do
it
myself,
though
at
each
successive
instance
of
your
reasoning
I
am
baffled
until
you
explain
your
process.
And
yet
I
believe
that
my
eyes
are
as
good
as
yours."
"Quite
so,"
he
answered,
lighting
a
cigarette,
and
throwing
himself
down
into
an
armchair.
"You
see,
but
you
do
not
observe.
The
distinction
is
clear.
For
example,
you
have
frequently
seen
the
steps
which
lead
up
from
the
hall
to
this
room."
"Frequently."
"How
often?"
"Well,
some
hundreds
of
times."
"Then
how
many
are
there?"
"How
many?
I
don't
know."
"Quite
so!
You
have
not
observed.
And
yet
you
have
seen.
That
is
just
my
point.
Now,
I
know
that
there
are
seventeen
steps,
because
I
have
both
seen
and
observed.
By-the-way,
since
you
are
interested
in
these
little
problems,
and
since
you
are
good
enough
to
chronicle
one
or
two
of
my
trifling
experiences,
you
may
be
interested
in
this."
He
threw
over
a
sheet
of
thick,
pink-tinted
note-paper
which
had
been
lying
open
upon
the
table.
"It
came
by
the
last
post,"
said
he.
"Read
it
aloud."
The
note
was
undated,
and
without
either
signature
or
address.
"There
will
call
upon
you
to-night,
at
a
quarter
to
eight
o'clock,"
it
said,
"a
gentleman
who
desires
to
consult
you
upon
a
matter
of
the
very
deepest
moment.
Your
recent
services
to
one
of
the
royal
houses
of
Europe
have
shown
that
you
are
one
who
may
safely
be
trusted
with
matters
which
are
of
an
importance
which
can
hardly
be
exaggerated.
This
account
of
you
we
have
from
all
quarters
received.
Be
in
your
chamber
then
at
that
hour,
and
do
not
take
it
amiss
if
your
visitor
wear
a
mask."
"This
is
indeed
a
mystery,"
I
remarked.
"What
do
you
imagine
that
it
means?"
"I
have
no
data
yet.
It
is
a
capital
mistake
to
theorize
before
one
has
data.
Insensibly
one
begins
to
twist
facts
to
suit
theories,
instead
of
theories
to
suit
facts.
But
the
note
itself.
What
do
you
deduce
from
it?"
I
carefully
examined
the
writing,
and
the
paper
upon
which
it
was
written.
"The
man
who
wrote
it
was
presumably
well
to
do,"
I
remarked,
endeavouring
to
imitate
my
companion's
processes.
"Such
paper
could
not
be
bought
under
half
a
crown
a
packet.
It
is
peculiarly
strong
and
stiff."
"Peculiar--that
is
the
very
word,"
said
Holmes.
"It
is
not
an
English
paper
at
all.
Hold
it
up
to
the
light."
I
did
so,
and
saw
a
large
"E"
with
a
small
"g,"
a
"P,"
and
a
large
"G"
with
a
small
"t"
woven
into
the
texture
of
the
paper.
"What
do
you
make
of
that?"
asked
Holmes.
"The
name
of
the
maker,
no
doubt;
or
his
monogram,
rather."
"Not
at
all.
The
'G'
with
the
small
't'
stands
for
'Gesellschaft,'
which
is
the
German
for
'Company.'
It
is
a
customary
contraction
like
our
'Co.'
'P,'
of
course,
stands
for
'Papier.'
Now
for
the
'Eg.'
Let
us
glance
at
our
Continental
Gazetteer."
He
took
down
a
heavy
brown
volume
from
his
shelves.
"Eglow,
Eglonitz--here
we
are,
Egria.
It
is
in
a
German-speaking
country--in
Bohemia,
not
far
from
Carlsbad.
'Remarkable
as
being
the
scene
of
the
death
of
Wallenstein,
and
for
its
numerous
glass-factories
and
paper-mills.'
Ha,
ha,
my
boy,
what
do
you
make
of
that?"
His
eyes
sparkled,
and
he
sent
up
a
great
blue
triumphant
cloud
from
his
cigarette.
"The
paper
was
made
in
Bohemia,"
I
said.
"Precisely.
And
the
man
who
wrote
the
note
is
a
German.
Do
you
note
the
peculiar
construction
of
the
sentence--'This
account
of
you
we
have
from
all
quarters
received.'
A
Frenchman
or
Russian
could
not
have
written
that.
It
is
the
German
who
is
so
uncourteous
to
his
verbs.
It
only
remains,
therefore,
to
discover
what
is
wanted
by
this
German
who
writes
upon
Bohemian
paper
and
prefers
wearing
a
mask
to
showing
his
face.
And
here
he
comes,
if
I
am
not
mistaken,
to
resolve
all
our
doubts."
As
he
spoke
there
was
the
sharp
sound
of
horses'
hoofs
and
grating
wheels
against
the
curb,
followed
by
a
sharp
pull
at
the
bell.
Holmes
whistled.
"A
pair,
by
the
sound,"
said
he.
"Yes,"
he
continued,
glancing
out
of
the
window.
"A
nice
little
brougham
and
a
pair
of
beauties.
A
hundred
and
fifty
guineas
apiece.
There's
money
in
this
case,
Watson,
if
there
is
nothing
else."
"I
think
that
I
had
better
go,
Holmes."
"Not
a
bit,
Doctor.
Stay
where
you
are.
I
am
lost
without
my
Boswell.
And
this
promises
to
be
interesting.
It
would
be
a
pity
to
miss
it."
"But
your
client--"
"Never
mind
him.
I
may
want
your
help,
and
so
may
he.
Here
he
comes.
Sit
down
in
that
armchair,
Doctor,
and
give
us
your
best
attention."
A
slow
and
heavy
step,
which
had
been
heard
upon
the
stairs
and
in
the
passage,
paused
immediately
outside
the
door.
Then
there
was
a
loud
and
authoritative
tap.
"Come
in!"
said
Holmes.
A
man
entered
who
could
hardly
have
been
less
than
six
feet
six
inches
in
height,
with
the
chest
and
limbs
of
a
Hercules.
His
dress
was
rich
with
a
richness
which
would,
in
England,
be
looked
upon
as
akin
to
bad
taste.
Heavy
bands
of
astrakhan
were
slashed
across
the
sleeves
and
fronts
of
his
double-breasted
coat,
while
the
deep
blue
cloak
which
was
thrown
over
his
shoulders
was
lined
with
flame-coloured
silk
and
secured
at
the
neck
with
a
brooch
which
consisted
of
a
single
flaming
beryl.
Boots
which
extended
halfway
up
his
calves,
and
which
were
trimmed
at
the
tops
with
rich
brown
fur,
completed
the
impression
of
barbaric
opulence
which
was
suggested
by
his
whole
appearance.
He
carried
a
broad-brimmed
hat
in
his
hand,
while
he
wore
across
the
upper
part
of
his
face,
extending
down
past
the
cheekbones,
a
black
vizard
mask,
which
he
had
apparently
adjusted
that
very
moment,
for
his
hand
was
still
raised
to
it
as
he
entered.
From
the
lower
part
of
the
face
he
appeared
to
be
a
man
of
strong
character,
with
a
thick,
hanging
lip,
and
a
long,
straight
chin
suggestive
of
resolution
pushed
to
the
length
of
obstinacy.
"You
had
my
note?"
he
asked
with
a
deep
harsh
voice
and
a
strongly
marked
German
accent.
"I
told
you
that
I
would
call."
He
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
us,
as
if
uncertain
which
to
address.
"Pray
take
a
seat,"
said
Holmes.
"This
is
my
friend
and
colleague,
Dr.
Watson,
who
is
occasionally
good
enough
to
help
me
in
my
cases.
Whom
have
I
the
honour
to
address?"
"You
may
address
me
as
the
Count
Von
Kramm,
a
Bohemian
nobleman.
I
understand
that
this
gentleman,
your
friend,
is
a
man
of
honour
and
discretion,
whom
I
may
trust
with
a
matter
of
the
most
extreme
importance.
If
not,
I
should
much
prefer
to
communicate
with
you
alone."
I
rose
to
go,
but
Holmes
caught
me
by
the
wrist
and
pushed
me
back
into
my
chair.
"It
is
both,
or
none,"
said
he.
"You
may
say
before
this
gentleman
anything
which
you
may
say
to
me."
The
Count
shrugged
his
broad
shoulders.
"Then
I
must
begin,"
said
he,
"by
binding
you
both
to
absolute
secrecy
for
two
years;
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
matter
will
be
of
no
importance.
At
present
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
it
is
of
such
weight
it
may
have
an
influence
upon
European
history."
"I
promise,"
said
Holmes.
"And
I."
"You
will
excuse
this
mask,"
continued
our
strange
visitor.
"The
august
person
who
employs
me
wishes
his
agent
to
be
unknown
to
you,
and
I
may
confess
at
once
that
the
title
by
which
I
have
just
called
myself
is
not
exactly
my
own."
"I
was
aware
of
it,"
said
Holmes
dryly.
"The
circumstances
are
of
great
delicacy,
and
every
precaution
has
to
be
taken
to
quench
what
might
grow
to
be
an
immense
scandal
and
seriously
compromise
one
of
the
reigning
families
of
Europe.
To
speak
plainly,
the
matter
implicates
the
great
House
of
Ormstein,
hereditary
kings
of
Bohemia."
"I
was
also
aware
of
that,"
murmured
Holmes,
settling
himself
down
in
his
armchair
and
closing
his
eyes.
Our
visitor
glanced
with
some
apparent
surprise
at
the
languid,
lounging
figure
of
the
man
who
had
been
no
doubt
depicted
to
him
as
the
most
incisive
reasoner
and
most
energetic
agent
in
Europe.
Holmes
slowly
reopened
his
eyes
and
looked
impatiently
at
his
gigantic
client.
"If
your
Majesty
would
condescend
to
state
your
case,"
he
remarked,
"I
should
be
better
able
to
advise
you."
The
man
sprang
from
his
chair
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
in
uncontrollable
agitation.
Then,
with
a
gesture
of
desperation,
he
tore
the
mask
from
his
face
and
hurled
it
upon
the
ground.
"You
are
right,"
he
cried;
"I
am
the
King.
Why
should
I
attempt
to
conceal
it?"
"Why,
indeed?"
murmured
Holmes.
"Your
Majesty
had
not
spoken
before
I
was
aware
that
I
was
addressing
Wilhelm
Gottsreich
Sigismond
von
Ormstein,
Grand
Duke
of
Cassel-Felstein,
and
hereditary
King
of
Bohemia."
"But
you
can
understand,"
said
our
strange
visitor,
sitting
down
once
more
and
passing
his
hand
over
his
high
white
forehead,
"you
can
understand
that
I
am
not
accustomed
to
doing
such
business
in
my
own
person.
Yet
the
matter
was
so
delicate
that
I
could
not
confide
it
to
an
agent
without
putting
myself
in
his
power.
I
have
come
incognito
from
Prague
for
the
purpose
of
consulting
you."
"Then,
pray
consult,"
said
Holmes,
shutting
his
eyes
once
more.
"The
facts
are
briefly
these:
Some
five
years
ago,
during
a
lengthy
visit
to
Warsaw,
I
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
well-known
adventuress,
Irene
Adler.
The
name
is
no
doubt
familiar
to
you."
"Kindly
look
her
up
in
my
index,
Doctor,"
murmured
Holmes
without
opening
his
eyes.
For
many
years
he
had
adopted
a
system
of
docketing
all
paragraphs
concerning
men
and
things,
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
name
a
subject
or
a
person
on
which
he
could
not
at
once
furnish
information.
In
this
case
I
found
her
biography
sandwiched
in
between
that
of
a
Hebrew
rabbi
and
that
of
a
staff-commander
who
had
written
a
monograph
upon
the
deep-sea
fishes.
"Let
me
see!"
said
Holmes.
"Hum!
Born
in
New
Jersey
in
the
year
1858.
Contralto--hum!
La
Scala,
hum!
Prima
donna
Imperial
Opera
of
Warsaw--yes!
Retired
from
operatic
stage--ha!
Living
in
London--quite
so!
Your
Majesty,
as
I
understand,
became
entangled
with
this
young
person,
wrote
her
some
compromising
letters,
and
is
now
desirous
of
getting
those
letters
back."
"Precisely
so.
But
how--"
"Was
there
a
secret
marriage?"
"None."
"No
legal
papers
or
certificates?"
"None."
"Then
I
fail
to
follow
your
Majesty.
If
this
young
person
should
produce
her
letters
for
blackmailing
or
other
purposes,
how
is
she
to
prove
their
authenticity?"
"There
is
the
writing."
"Pooh,
pooh!
Forgery."
"My
private
note-paper."
"Stolen."
"My
own
seal."
"Imitated."
"My
photograph."
"Bought."
"We
were
both
in
the
photograph."
"Oh,
dear!
That
is
very
bad!
Your
Majesty
has
indeed
committed
an
indiscretion."
"I
was
mad--insane."
"You
have
compromised
yourself
seriously."
"I
was
only
Crown
Prince
then.
I
was
young.
I
am
but
thirty
now."
"It
must
be
recovered."
"We
have
tried
and
failed."
"Your
Majesty
must
pay.
It
must
be
bought."
"She
will
not
sell."
"Stolen,
then."
"Five
attempts
have
been
made.
Twice
burglars
in
my
pay
ransacked
her
house.
Once
we
diverted
her
luggage
when
she
travelled.
Twice
she
has
been
waylaid.
There
has
been
no
result."
"No
sign
of
it?"
"Absolutely
none."
Holmes
laughed.
"It
is
quite
a
pretty
little
problem,"
said
he.
"But
a
very
serious
one
to
me,"
returned
the
King
reproachfully.
"Very,
indeed.
And
what
does
she
propose
to
do
with
the
photograph?"
"To
ruin
me."
"But
how?"
"I
am
about
to
be
married."
"So
I
have
heard."
"To
Clotilde
Lothman
von
Saxe-Meningen,
second
daughter
of
the
King
of
Scandinavia.
You
may
know
the
strict
principles
of
her
family.
She
is
herself
the
very
soul
of
delicacy.
A
shadow
of
a
doubt
as
to
my
conduct
would
bring
the
matter
to
an
end."
"And
Irene
Adler?"
"Threatens
to
send
them
the
photograph.
And
she
will
do
it.
I
know
that
she
will
do
it.
You
do
not
know
her,
but
she
has
a
soul
of
steel.
She
has
the
face
of
the
most
beautiful
of
women,
and
the
mind
of
the
most
resolute
of
men.
Rather
than
I
should
marry
another
woman,
there
are
no
lengths
to
which
she
would
not
go--none."
"You
are
sure
that
she
has
not
sent
it
yet?"
"I
am
sure."
"And
why?"
"Because
she
has
said
that
she
would
send
it
on
the
day
when
the
betrothal
was
publicly
proclaimed.
That
will
be
next
Monday."
"Oh,
then
we
have
three
days
yet,"
said
Holmes
with
a
yawn.
"That
is
very
fortunate,
as
I
have
one
or
two
matters
of
importance
to
look
into
just
at
present.
Your
Majesty
will,
of
course,
stay
in
London
for
the
present?"
"Certainly.
You
will
find
me
at
the
Langham
under
the
name
of
the
Count
Von
Kramm."
"Then
I
shall
drop
you
a
line
to
let
you
know
how
we
progress."
"Pray
do
so.
I
shall
be
all
anxiety."
"Then,
as
to
money?"
"You
have
carte
blanche."
"Absolutely?"
"I
tell
you
that
I
would
give
one
of
the
provinces
of
my
kingdom
to
have
that
photograph."
"And
for
present
expenses?"
The
King
took
a
heavy
chamois
leather
bag
from
under
his
cloak
and
laid
it
on
the
table.
"There
are
three
hundred
pounds
in
gold
and
seven
hundred
in
notes,"
he
said.
Holmes
scribbled
a
receipt
upon
a
sheet
of
his
note-book
and
handed
it
to
him.
"And
Mademoiselle's
address?"
he
asked.
"Is
Briony
Lodge,
Serpentine
Avenue,
St.
John's
Wood."
Holmes
took
a
note
of
it.
"One
other
question,"
said
he.
"Was
the
photograph
a
cabinet?"
"It
was."
"Then,
good-night,
your
Majesty,
and
I
trust
that
we
shall
soon
have
some
good
news
for
you.
And
good-night,
Watson,"
he
added,
as
the
wheels
of
the
royal
brougham
rolled
down
the
street.
"If
you
will
be
good
enough
to
call
to-morrow
afternoon
at
three
o'clock
I
should
like
to
chat
this
little
matter
over
with
you."
II.
At
three
o'clock
precisely
I
was
at
Baker
Street,
but
Holmes
had
not
yet
returned.
The
landlady
informed
me
that
he
had
left
the
house
shortly
after
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning.
I
sat
down
beside
the
fire,
however,
with
the
intention
of
awaiting
him,
however
long
he
might
be.
I
was
already
deeply
interested
in
his
inquiry,
for,
though
it
was
surrounded
by
none
of
the
grim
and
strange
features
which
were
associated
with
the
two
crimes
which
I
have
already
recorded,
still,
the
nature
of
the
case
and
the
exalted
station
of
his
client
gave
it
a
character
of
its
own.
Indeed,
apart
from
the
nature
of
the
investigation
which
my
friend
had
on
hand,
there
was
something
in
his
masterly
grasp
of
a
situation,
and
his
keen,
incisive
reasoning,
which
made
it
a
pleasure
to
me
to
study
his
system
of
work,
and
to
follow
the
quick,
subtle
methods
by
which
he
disentangled
the
most
inextricable
mysteries.
So
accustomed
was
I
to
his
invariable
success
that
the
very
possibility
of
his
failing
had
ceased
to
enter
into
my
head.
It
was
close
upon
four
before
the
door
opened,
and
a
drunken-looking
groom,
ill-kempt
and
side-whiskered,
with
an
inflamed
face
and
disreputable
clothes,
walked
into
the
room.
Accustomed
as
I
was
to
my
friend's
amazing
powers
in
the
use
of
disguises,
I
had
to
look
three
times
before
I
was
certain
that
it
was
indeed
he.
With
a
nod
he
vanished
into
the
bedroom,
whence
he
emerged
in
five
minutes
tweed-suited
and
respectable,
as
of
old.
Putting
his
hands
into
his
pockets,
he
stretched
out
his
legs
in
front
of
the
fire
and
laughed
heartily
for
some
minutes.
"Well,
really!"
he
cried,
and
then
he
choked
and
laughed
again
until
he
was
obliged
to
lie
back,
limp
and
helpless,
in
the
chair.
"What
is
it?"
"It's
quite
too
funny.
I
am
sure
you
could
never
guess
how
I
employed
my
morning,
or
what
I
ended
by
doing."
"I
can't
imagine.
I
suppose
that
you
have
been
watching
the
habits,
and
perhaps
the
house,
of
Miss
Irene
Adler."
"Quite
so;
but
the
sequel
was
rather
unusual.
I
will
tell
you,
however.
I
left
the
house
a
little
after
eight
o'clock
this
morning
in
the
character
of
a
groom
out
of
work.
There
is
a
wonderful
sympathy
and
freemasonry
among
horsey
men.
Be
one
of
them,
and
you
will
know
all
that
there
is
to
know.
I
soon
found
Briony
Lodge.
It
is
a
bijou
villa,
with
a
garden
at
the
back,
but
built
out
in
front
right
up
to
the
road,
two
stories.
Chubb
lock
to
the
door.
Large
sitting-room
on
the
right
side,
well
furnished,
with
long
windows
almost
to
the
floor,
and
those
preposterous
English
window
fasteners
which
a
child
could
open.
Behind
there
was
nothing
remarkable,
save
that
the
passage
window
could
be
reached
from
the
top
of
the
coach-house.
I
walked
round
it
and
examined
it
closely
from
every
point
of
view,
but
without
noting
anything
else
of
interest.
"I
then
lounged
down
the
street
and
found,
as
I
expected,
that
there
was
a
mews
in
a
lane
which
runs
down
by
one
wall
of
the
garden.
I
lent
the
ostlers
a
hand
in
rubbing
down
their
horses,
and
received
in
exchange
twopence,
a
glass
of
half
and
half,
two
fills
of
shag
tobacco,
and
as
much
information
as
I
could
desire
about
Miss
Adler,
to
say
nothing
of
half
a
dozen
other
people
in
the
neighbourhood
in
whom
I
was
not
in
the
least
interested,
but
whose
biographies
I
was
compelled
to
listen
to."
"And
what
of
Irene
Adler?"
I
asked.
"Oh,
she
has
turned
all
the
men's
heads
down
in
that
part.
She
is
the
daintiest
thing
under
a
bonnet
on
this
planet.
So
say
the
Serpentine-mews,
to
a
man.
She
lives
quietly,
sings
at
concerts,
drives
out
at
five
every
day,
and
returns
at
seven
sharp
for
dinner.
Seldom
goes
out
at
other
times,
except
when
she
sings.
Has
only
one
male
visitor,
but
a
good
deal
of
him.
He
is
dark,
handsome,
and
dashing,
never
calls
less
than
once
a
day,
and
often
twice.
He
is
a
Mr.
Godfrey
Norton,
of
the
Inner
Temple.
See
the
advantages
of
a
cabman
as
a
confidant.
They
had
driven
him
home
a
dozen
times
from
Serpentine-mews,
and
knew
all
about
him.
When
I
had
listened
to
all
they
had
to
tell,
I
began
to
walk
up
and
down
near
Briony
Lodge
once
more,
and
to
think
over
my
plan
of
campaign.
"This
Godfrey
Norton
was
evidently
an
important
factor
in
the
matter.
He
was
a
lawyer.
That
sounded
ominous.
What
was
the
relation
between
them,
and
what
the
object
of
his
repeated
visits?
Was
she
his
client,
his
friend,
or
his
mistress?
If
the
former,
she
had
probably
transferred
the
photograph
to
his
keeping.
If
the
latter,
it
was
less
likely.
On
the
issue
of
this
question
depended
whether
I
should
continue
my
work
at
Briony
Lodge,
or
turn
my
attention
to
the
gentleman's
chambers
in
the
Temple.
It
was
a
delicate
point,
and
it
widened
the
field
of
my
inquiry.
I
fear
that
I
bore
you
with
these
details,
but
I
have
to
let
you
see
my
little
difficulties,
if
you
are
to
understand
the
situation."
"I
am
following
you
closely,"
I
answered.
"I
was
still
balancing
the
matter
in
my
mind
when
a
hansom
cab
drove
up
to
Briony
Lodge,
and
a
gentleman
sprang
out.
He
was
a
remarkably
handsome
man,
dark,
aquiline,
and
moustached--evidently
the
man
of
whom
I
had
heard.
He
appeared
to
be
in
a
great
hurry,
shouted
to
the
cabman
to
wait,
and
brushed
past
the
maid
who
opened
the
door
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
thoroughly
at
home.
"He
was
in
the
house
about
half
an
hour,
and
I
could
catch
glimpses
of
him
in
the
windows
of
the
sitting-room,
pacing
up
and
down,
talking
excitedly,
and
waving
his
arms.
Of
her
I
could
see
nothing.
Presently
he
emerged,
looking
even
more
flurried
than
before.
As
he
stepped
up
to
the
cab,
he
pulled
a
gold
watch
from
his
pocket
and
looked
at
it
earnestly,
'Drive
like
the
devil,'
he
shouted,
'first
to
Gross
&
Hankey's
in
Regent
Street,
and
then
to
the
Church
of
St.
Monica
in
the
Edgeware
Road.
Half
a
guinea
if
you
do
it
in
twenty
minutes!'
"Away
they
went,
and
I
was
just
wondering
whether
I
should
not
do
well
to
follow
them
when
up
the
lane
came
a
neat
little
landau,
the
coachman
with
his
coat
only
half-buttoned,
and
his
tie
under
his
ear,
while
all
the
tags
of
his
harness
were
sticking
out
of
the
buckles.
It
hadn't
pulled
up
before
she
shot
out
of
the
hall
door
and
into
it.
I
only
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
at
the
moment,
but
she
was
a
lovely
woman,
with
a
face
that
a
man
might
die
for.
"'The
Church
of
St.
Monica,
John,'
she
cried,
'and
half
a
sovereign
if
you
reach
it
in
twenty
minutes.'
"This
was
quite
too
good
to
lose,
Watson.
I
was
just
balancing
whether
I
should
run
for
it,
or
whether
I
should
perch
behind
her
landau
when
a
cab
came
through
the
street.
The
driver
looked
twice
at
such
a
shabby
fare,
but
I
jumped
in
before
he
could
object.
'The
Church
of
St.
Monica,'
said
I,
'and
half
a
sovereign
if
you
reach
it
in
twenty
minutes.'
It
was
twenty-five
minutes
to
twelve,
and
of
course
it
was
clear
enough
what
was
in
the
wind.
"My
cabby
drove
fast.
I
don't
think
I
ever
drove
faster,
but
the
others
were
there
before
us.
The
cab
and
the
landau
with
their
steaming
horses
were
in
front
of
the
door
when
I
arrived.
I
paid
the
man
and
hurried
into
the
church.
There
was
not
a
soul
there
save
the
two
whom
I
had
followed
and
a
surpliced
clergyman,
who
seemed
to
be
expostulating
with
them.
They
were
all
three
standing
in
a
knot
in
front
of
the
altar.
I
lounged
up
the
side
aisle
like
any
other
idler
who
has
dropped
into
a
church.
Suddenly,
to
my
surprise,
the
three
at
the
altar
faced
round
to
me,
and
Godfrey
Norton
came
running
as
hard
as
he
could
towards
me.
"'Thank
God,'
he
cried.
'You'll
do.
Come!
Come!'
"'What
then?'
I
asked.
"'Come,
man,
come,
only
three
minutes,
or
it
won't
be
legal.'
"I
was
half-dragged
up
to
the
altar,
and
before
I
knew
where
I
was
I
found
myself
mumbling
responses
which
were
whispered
in
my
ear,
and
vouching
for
things
of
which
I
knew
nothing,
and
generally
assisting
in
the
secure
tying
up
of
Irene
Adler,
spinster,
to
Godfrey
Norton,
bachelor.
It
was
all
done
in
an
instant,
and
there
was
the
gentleman
thanking
me
on
the
one
side
and
the
lady
on
the
other,
while
the
clergyman
beamed
on
me
in
front.
It
was
the
most
preposterous
position
in
which
I
ever
found
myself
in
my
life,
and
it
was
the
thought
of
it
that
started
me
laughing
just
now.
It
seems
that
there
had
been
some
informality
about
their
license,
that
the
clergyman
absolutely
refused
to
marry
them
without
a
witness
of
some
sort,
and
that
my
lucky
appearance
saved
the
bridegroom
from
having
to
sally
out
into
the
streets
in
search
of
a
best
man.
The
bride
gave
me
a
sovereign,
and
I
mean
to
wear
it
on
my
watch-chain
in
memory
of
the
occasion."
"This
is
a
very
unexpected
turn
of
affairs,"
said
I;
"and
what
then?"
"Well,
I
found
my
plans
very
seriously
menaced.
It
looked
as
if
the
pair
might
take
an
immediate
departure,
and
so
necessitate
very
prompt
and
energetic
measures
on
my
part.
At
the
church
door,
however,
they
separated,
he
driving
back
to
the
Temple,
and
she
to
her
own
house.
'I
shall
drive
out
in
the
park
at
five
as
usual,'
she
said
as
she
left
him.
I
heard
no
more.
They
drove
away
in
different
directions,
and
I
went
off
to
make
my
own
arrangements."
"Which
are?"
"Some
cold
beef
and
a
glass
of
beer,"
he
answered,
ringing
the
bell.
"I
have
been
too
busy
to
think
of
food,
and
I
am
likely
to
be
busier
still
this
evening.
By
the
way,
Doctor,
I
shall
want
your
co-operation."
"I
shall
be
delighted."
"You
don't
mind
breaking
the
law?"
"Not
in
the
least."
"Nor
running
a
chance
of
arrest?"
"Not
in
a
good
cause."
"Oh,
the
cause
is
excellent!"
"Then
I
am
your
man."
"I
was
sure
that
I
might
rely
on
you."
"But
what
is
it
you
wish?"
"When
Mrs.
Turner
has
brought
in
the
tray
I
will
make
it
clear
to
you.
Now,"
he
said
as
he
turned
hungrily
on
the
simple
fare
that
our
landlady
had
provided,
"I
must
discuss
it
while
I
eat,
for
I
have
not
much
time.
It
is
nearly
five
now.
In
two
hours
we
must
be
on
the
scene
of
action.
Miss
Irene,
or
Madame,
rather,
returns
from
her
drive
at
seven.
We
must
be
at
Briony
Lodge
to
meet
her."
"And
what
then?"
"You
must
leave
that
to
me.
I
have
already
arranged
what
is
to
occur.
There
is
only
one
point
on
which
I
must
insist.
You
must
not
interfere,
come
what
may.
You
understand?"
"I
am
to
be
neutral?"
"To
do
nothing
whatever.
There
will
probably
be
some
small
unpleasantness.
Do
not
join
in
it.
It
will
end
in
my
being
conveyed
into
the
house.
Four
or
five
minutes
afterwards
the
sitting-room
window
will
open.
You
are
to
station
yourself
close
to
that
open
window."
"Yes."
"You
are
to
watch
me,
for
I
will
be
visible
to
you."
"Yes."
"And
when
I
raise
my
hand--so--you
will
throw
into
the
room
what
I
give
you
to
throw,
and
will,
at
the
same
time,
raise
the
cry
of
fire.
You
quite
follow
me?"
"Entirely."
"It
is
nothing
very
formidable,"
he
said,
taking
a
long
cigar-shaped
roll
from
his
pocket.
"It
is
an
ordinary
plumber's
smoke-rocket,
fitted
with
a
cap
at
either
end
to
make
it
self-lighting.
Your
task
is
confined
to
that.
When
you
raise
your
cry
of
fire,
it
will
be
taken
up
by
quite
a
number
of
people.
You
may
then
walk
to
the
end
of
the
street,
and
I
will
rejoin
you
in
ten
minutes.
I
hope
that
I
have
made
myself
clear?"
"I
am
to
remain
neutral,
to
get
near
the
window,
to
watch
you,
and
at
the
signal
to
throw
in
this
object,
then
to
raise
the
cry
of
fire,
and
to
wait
you
at
the
corner
of
the
street."
"Precisely."
"Then
you
may
entirely
rely
on
me."
"That
is
excellent.
I
think,
perhaps,
it
is
almost
time
that
I
prepare
for
the
new
role
I
have
to
play."
He
disappeared
into
his
bedroom
and
returned
in
a
few
minutes
in
the
character
of
an
amiable
and
simple-minded
Nonconformist
clergyman.
His
broad
black
hat,
his
baggy
trousers,
his
white
tie,
his
sympathetic
smile,
and
general
look
of
peering
and
benevolent
curiosity
were
such
as
Mr.
John
Hare
alone
could
have
equalled.
It
was
not
merely
that
Holmes
changed
his
costume.
His
expression,
his
manner,
his
very
soul
seemed
to
vary
with
every
fresh
part
that
he
assumed.
The
stage
lost
a
fine
actor,
even
as
science
lost
an
acute
reasoner,
when
he
became
a
specialist
in
crime.
It
was
a
quarter
past
six
when
we
left
Baker
Street,
and
it
still
wanted
ten
minutes
to
the
hour
when
we
found
ourselves
in
Serpentine
Avenue.
It
was
already
dusk,
and
the
lamps
were
just
being
lighted
as
we
paced
up
and
down
in
front
of
Briony
Lodge,
waiting
for
the
coming
of
its
occupant.
The
house
was
just
such
as
I
had
pictured
it
from
Sherlock
Holmes'
succinct
description,
but
the
locality
appeared
to
be
less
private
than
I
expected.
On
the
contrary,
for
a
small
street
in
a
quiet
neighbourhood,
it
was
remarkably
animated.
There
was
a
group
of
shabbily
dressed
men
smoking
and
laughing
in
a
corner,
a
scissors-grinder
with
his
wheel,
two
guardsmen
who
were
flirting
with
a
nurse-girl,
and
several
well-dressed
young
men
who
were
lounging
up
and
down
with
cigars
in
their
mouths.
"You
see,"
remarked
Holmes,
as
we
paced
to
and
fro
in
front
of
the
house,
"this
marriage
rather
simplifies
matters.
The
photograph
becomes
a
double-edged
weapon
now.
The
chances
are
that
she
would
be
as
averse
to
its
being
seen
by
Mr.
Godfrey
Norton,
as
our
client
is
to
its
coming
to
the
eyes
of
his
princess.
Now
the
question
is,
Where
are
we
to
find
the
photograph?"
"Where,
indeed?"
"It
is
most
unlikely
that
she
carries
it
about
with
her.
It
is
cabinet
size.
Too
large
for
easy
concealment
about
a
woman's
dress.
She
knows
that
the
King
is
capable
of
having
her
waylaid
and
searched.
Two
attempts
of
the
sort
have
already
been
made.
We
may
take
it,
then,
that
she
does
not
carry
it
about
with
her."
"Where,
then?"
"Her
banker
or
her
lawyer.
There
is
that
double
possibility.
But
I
am
inclined
to
think
neither.
Women
are
naturally
secretive,
and
they
like
to
do
their
own
secreting.
Why
should
she
hand
it
over
to
anyone
else?
She
could
trust
her
own
guardianship,
but
she
could
not
tell
what
indirect
or
political
influence
might
be
brought
to
bear
upon
a
business
man.
Besides,
remember
that
she
had
resolved
to
use
it
within
a
few
days.
It
must
be
where
she
can
lay
her
hands
upon
it.
It
must
be
in
her
own
house."
"But
it
has
twice
been
burgled."
"Pshaw!
They
did
not
know
how
to
look."
"But
how
will
you
look?"
"I
will
not
look."
"What
then?"
"I
will
get
her
to
show
me."
"But
she
will
refuse."
"She
will
not
be
able
to.
But
I
hear
the
rumble
of
wheels.
It
is
her
carriage.
Now
carry
out
my
orders
to
the
letter."
As
he
spoke
the
gleam
of
the
side-lights
of
a
carriage
came
round
the
curve
of
the
avenue.
It
was
a
smart
little
landau
which
rattled
up
to
the
door
of
Briony
Lodge.
As
it
pulled
up,
one
of
the
loafing
men
at
the
corner
dashed
forward
to
open
the
door
in
the
hope
of
earning
a
copper,
but
was
elbowed
away
by
another
loafer,
who
had
rushed
up
with
the
same
intention.
A
fierce
quarrel
broke
out,
which
was
increased
by
the
two
guardsmen,
who
took
sides
with
one
of
the
loungers,
and
by
the
scissors-grinder,
who
was
equally
hot
upon
the
other
side.
A
blow
was
struck,
and
in
an
instant
the
lady,
who
had
stepped
from
her
carriage,
was
the
centre
of
a
little
knot
of
flushed
and
struggling
men,
who
struck
savagely
at
each
other
with
their
fists
and
sticks.
Holmes
dashed
into
the
crowd
to
protect
the
lady;
but
just
as
he
reached
her
he
gave
a
cry
and
dropped
to
the
ground,
with
the
blood
running
freely
down
his
face.
At
his
fall
the
guardsmen
took
to
their
heels
in
one
direction
and
the
loungers
in
the
other,
while
a
number
of
better-dressed
people,
who
had
watched
the
scuffle
without
taking
part
in
it,
crowded
in
to
help
the
lady
and
to
attend
to
the
injured
man.
Irene
Adler,
as
I
will
still
call
her,
had
hurried
up
the
steps;
but
she
stood
at
the
top
with
her
superb
figure
outlined
against
the
lights
of
the
hall,
looking
back
into
the
street.
"Is
the
poor
gentleman
much
hurt?"
she
asked.
"He
is
dead,"
cried
several
voices.
"No,
no,
there's
life
in
him!"
shouted
another.
"But
he'll
be
gone
before
you
can
get
him
to
hospital."
"He's
a
brave
fellow,"
said
a
woman.
"They
would
have
had
the
lady's
purse
and
watch
if
it
hadn't
been
for
him.
They
were
a
gang,
and
a
rough
one,
too.
Ah,
he's
breathing
now."
"He
can't
lie
in
the
street.
May
we
bring
him
in,
marm?"
"Surely.
Bring
him
into
the
sitting-room.
There
is
a
comfortable
sofa.
This
way,
please!"
Slowly
and
solemnly
he
was
borne
into
Briony
Lodge
and
laid
out
in
the
principal
room,
while
I
still
observed
the
proceedings
from
my
post
by
the
window.
The
lamps
had
been
lit,
but
the
blinds
had
not
been
drawn,
so
that
I
could
see
Holmes
as
he
lay
upon
the
couch.
I
do
not
know
whether
he
was
seized
with
compunction
at
that
moment
for
the
part
he
was
playing,
but
I
know
that
I
never
felt
more
heartily
ashamed
of
myself
in
my
life
than
when
I
saw
the
beautiful
creature
against
whom
I
was
conspiring,
or
the
grace
and
kindliness
with
which
she
waited
upon
the
injured
man.
And
yet
it
would
be
the
blackest
treachery
to
Holmes
to
draw
back
now
from
the
part
which
he
had
intrusted
to
me.
I
hardened
my
heart,
and
took
the
smoke-rocket
from
under
my
ulster.
After
all,
I
thought,
we
are
not
injuring
her.
We
are
but
preventing
her
from
injuring
another.
Holmes
had
sat
up
upon
the
couch,
and
I
saw
him
motion
like
a
man
who
is
in
need
of
air.
A
maid
rushed
across
and
threw
open
the
window.
At
the
same
instant
I
saw
him
raise
his
hand
and
at
the
signal
I
tossed
my
rocket
into
the
room
with
a
cry
of
"Fire!"
The
word
was
no
sooner
out
of
my
mouth
than
the
whole
crowd
of
spectators,
well
dressed
and
ill--gentlemen,
ostlers,
and
servant-maids--joined
in
a
general
shriek
of
"Fire!"
Thick
clouds
of
smoke
curled
through
the
room
and
out
at
the
open
window.
I
caught
a
glimpse
of
rushing
figures,
and
a
moment
later
the
voice
of
Holmes
from
within
assuring
them
that
it
was
a
false
alarm.
Slipping
through
the
shouting
crowd
I
made
my
way
to
the
corner
of
the
street,
and
in
ten
minutes
was
rejoiced
to
find
my
friend's
arm
in
mine,
and
to
get
away
from
the
scene
of
uproar.
He
walked
swiftly
and
in
silence
for
some
few
minutes
until
we
had
turned
down
one
of
the
quiet
streets
which
lead
towards
the
Edgeware
Road.
"You
did
it
very
nicely,
Doctor,"
he
remarked.
"Nothing
could
have
been
better.
It
is
all
right."
"You
have
the
photograph?"
"I
know
where
it
is."
"And
how
did
you
find
out?"
"She
showed
me,
as
I
told
you
she
would."
"I
am
still
in
the
dark."
"I
do
not
wish
to
make
a
mystery,"
said
he,
laughing.
"The
matter
was
perfectly
simple.
You,
of
course,
saw
that
everyone
in
the
street
was
an
accomplice.
They
were
all
engaged
for
the
evening."
"I
guessed
as
much."
"Then,
when
the
row
broke
out,
I
had
a
little
moist
red
paint
in
the
palm
of
my
hand.
I
rushed
forward,
fell
down,
clapped
my
hand
to
my
face,
and
became
a
piteous
spectacle.
It
is
an
old
trick."
"That
also
I
could
fathom."
"Then
they
carried
me
in.
She
was
bound
to
have
me
in.
What
else
could
she
do?
And
into
her
sitting-room,
which
was
the
very
room
which
I
suspected.
It
lay
between
that
and
her
bedroom,
and
I
was
determined
to
see
which.
They
laid
me
on
a
couch,
I
motioned
for
air,
they
were
compelled
to
open
the
window,
and
you
had
your
chance."
"How
did
that
help
you?"
"It
was
all-important.
When
a
woman
thinks
that
her
house
is
on
fire,
her
instinct
is
at
once
to
rush
to
the
thing
which
she
values
most.
It
is
a
perfectly
overpowering
impulse,
and
I
have
more
than
once
taken
advantage
of
it.
In
the
case
of
the
Darlington
substitution
scandal
it
was
of
use
to
me,
and
also
in
the
Arnsworth
Castle
business.
A
married
woman
grabs
at
her
baby;
an
unmarried
one
reaches
for
her
jewel-box.
Now
it
was
clear
to
me
that
our
lady
of
to-day
had
nothing
in
the
house
more
precious
to
her
than
what
we
are
in
quest
of.
She
would
rush
to
secure
it.
The
alarm
of
fire
was
admirably
done.
The
smoke
and
shouting
were
enough
to
shake
nerves
of
steel.
She
responded
beautifully.
The
photograph
is
in
a
recess
behind
a
sliding
panel
just
above
the
right
bell-pull.
She
was
there
in
an
instant,
and
I
caught
a
glimpse
of
it
as
she
half-drew
it
out.
When
I
cried
out
that
it
was
a
false
alarm,
she
replaced
it,
glanced
at
the
rocket,
rushed
from
the
room,
and
I
have
not
seen
her
since.
I
rose,
and,
making
my
excuses,
escaped
from
the
house.
I
hesitated
whether
to
attempt
to
secure
the
photograph
at
once;
but
the
coachman
had
come
in,
and
as
he
was
watching
me
narrowly
it
seemed
safer
to
wait.
A
little
over-precipitance
may
ruin
all."
"And
now?"
I
asked.
"Our
quest
is
practically
finished.
I
shall
call
with
the
King
to-morrow,
and
with
you,
if
you
care
to
come
with
us.
We
will
be
shown
into
the
sitting-room
to
wait
for
the
lady,
but
it
is
probable
that
when
she
comes
she
may
find
neither
us
nor
the
photograph.
It
might
be
a
satisfaction
to
his
Majesty
to
regain
it
with
his
own
hands."
"And
when
will
you
call?"
"At
eight
in
the
morning.
She
will
not
be
up,
so
that
we
shall
have
a
clear
field.
Besides,
we
must
be
prompt,
for
this
marriage
may
mean
a
complete
change
in
her
life
and
habits.
I
must
wire
to
the
King
without
delay."
We
had
reached
Baker
Street
and
had
stopped
at
the
door.
He
was
searching
his
pockets
for
the
key
when
someone
passing
said:
"Good-night,
Mister
Sherlock
Holmes."
There
were
several
people
on
the
pavement
at
the
time,
but
the
greeting
appeared
to
come
from
a
slim
youth
in
an
ulster
who
had
hurried
by.
"I've
heard
that
voice
before,"
said
Holmes,
staring
down
the
dimly
lit
street.
"Now,
I
wonder
who
the
deuce
that
could
have
been."
III.
I
slept
at
Baker
Street
that
night,
and
we
were
engaged
upon
our
toast
and
coffee
in
the
morning
when
the
King
of
Bohemia
rushed
into
the
room.
"You
have
really
got
it!"
he
cried,
grasping
Sherlock
Holmes
by
either
shoulder
and
looking
eagerly
into
his
face.
"Not
yet."
"But
you
have
hopes?"
"I
have
hopes."
"Then,
come.
I
am
all
impatience
to
be
gone."
"We
must
have
a
cab."
"No,
my
brougham
is
waiting."
"Then
that
will
simplify
matters."
We
descended
and
started
off
once
more
for
Briony
Lodge.
"Irene
Adler
is
married,"
remarked
Holmes.
"Married!
When?"
"Yesterday."
"But
to
whom?"
"To
an
English
lawyer
named
Norton."
"But
she
could
not
love
him."
"I
am
in
hopes
that
she
does."
"And
why
in
hopes?"
"Because
it
would
spare
your
Majesty
all
fear
of
future
annoyance.
If
the
lady
loves
her
husband,
she
does
not
love
your
Majesty.
If
she
does
not
love
your
Majesty,
there
is
no
reason
why
she
should
interfere
with
your
Majesty's
plan."
"It
is
true.
And
yet--Well!
I
wish
she
had
been
of
my
own
station!
What
a
queen
she
would
have
made!"
He
relapsed
into
a
moody
silence,
which
was
not
broken
until
we
drew
up
in
Serpentine
Avenue.
The
door
of
Briony
Lodge
was
open,
and
an
elderly
woman
stood
upon
the
steps.
She
watched
us
with
a
sardonic
eye
as
we
stepped
from
the
brougham.
"Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes,
I
believe?"
said
she.
"I
am
Mr.
Holmes,"
answered
my
companion,
looking
at
her
with
a
questioning
and
rather
startled
gaze.
"Indeed!
My
mistress
told
me
that
you
were
likely
to
call.
She
left
this
morning
with
her
husband
by
the
5:15
train
from
Charing
Cross
for
the
Continent."
"What!"
Sherlock
Holmes
staggered
back,
white
with
chagrin
and
surprise.
"Do
you
mean
that
she
has
left
England?"
"Never
to
return."
"And
the
papers?"
asked
the
King
hoarsely.
"All
is
lost."
"We
shall
see."
He
pushed
past
the
servant
and
rushed
into
the
drawing-room,
followed
by
the
King
and
myself.
The
furniture
was
scattered
about
in
every
direction,
with
dismantled
shelves
and
open
drawers,
as
if
the
lady
had
hurriedly
ransacked
them
before
her
flight.
Holmes
rushed
at
the
bell-pull,
tore
back
a
small
sliding
shutter,
and,
plunging
in
his
hand,
pulled
out
a
photograph
and
a
letter.
The
photograph
was
of
Irene
Adler
herself
in
evening
dress,
the
letter
was
superscribed
to
"Sherlock
Holmes,
Esq.
To
be
left
till
called
for."
My
friend
tore
it
open
and
we
all
three
read
it
together.
It
was
dated
at
midnight
of
the
preceding
night
and
ran
in
this
way:
"MY
DEAR
MR.
SHERLOCK
HOLMES,--You
really
did
it
very
well.
You
took
me
in
completely.
Until
after
the
alarm
of
fire,
I
had
not
a
suspicion.
But
then,
when
I
found
how
I
had
betrayed
myself,
I
began
to
think.
I
had
been
warned
against
you
months
ago.
I
had
been
told
that
if
the
King
employed
an
agent
it
would
certainly
be
you.
And
your
address
had
been
given
me.
Yet,
with
all
this,
you
made
me
reveal
what
you
wanted
to
know.
Even
after
I
became
suspicious,
I
found
it
hard
to
think
evil
of
such
a
dear,
kind
old
clergyman.
But,
you
know,
I
have
been
trained
as
an
actress
myself.
Male
costume
is
nothing
new
to
me.
I
often
take
advantage
of
the
freedom
which
it
gives.
I
sent
John,
the
coachman,
to
watch
you,
ran
up
stairs,
got
into
my
walking-clothes,
as
I
call
them,
and
came
down
just
as
you
departed.
"Well,
I
followed
you
to
your
door,
and
so
made
sure
that
I
was
really
an
object
of
interest
to
the
celebrated
Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes.
Then
I,
rather
imprudently,
wished
you
good-night,
and
started
for
the
Temple
to
see
my
husband.
"We
both
thought
the
best
resource
was
flight,
when
pursued
by
so
formidable
an
antagonist;
so
you
will
find
the
nest
empty
when
you
call
to-morrow.
As
to
the
photograph,
your
client
may
rest
in
peace.
I
love
and
am
loved
by
a
better
man
than
he.
The
King
may
do
what
he
will
without
hindrance
from
one
whom
he
has
cruelly
wronged.
I
keep
it
only
to
safeguard
myself,
and
to
preserve
a
weapon
which
will
always
secure
me
from
any
steps
which
he
might
take
in
the
future.
I
leave
a
photograph
which
he
might
care
to
possess;
and
I
remain,
dear
Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes,
"Very
truly
yours,
"IRENE
NORTON,
née
ADLER."
"What
a
woman--oh,
what
a
woman!"
cried
the
King
of
Bohemia,
when
we
had
all
three
read
this
epistle.
"Did
I
not
tell
you
how
quick
and
resolute
she
was?
Would
she
not
have
made
an
admirable
queen?
Is
it
not
a
pity
that
she
was
not
on
my
level?"
"From
what
I
have
seen
of
the
lady
she
seems
indeed
to
be
on
a
very
different
level
to
your
Majesty,"
said
Holmes
coldly.
"I
am
sorry
that
I
have
not
been
able
to
bring
your
Majesty's
business
to
a
more
successful
conclusion."
"On
the
contrary,
my
dear
sir,"
cried
the
King;
"nothing
could
be
more
successful.
I
know
that
her
word
is
inviolate.
The
photograph
is
now
as
safe
as
if
it
were
in
the
fire."
"I
am
glad
to
hear
your
Majesty
say
so."
"I
am
immensely
indebted
to
you.
Pray
tell
me
in
what
way
I
can
reward
you.
This
ring--"
He
slipped
an
emerald
snake
ring
from
his
finger
and
held
it
out
upon
the
palm
of
his
hand.
"Your
Majesty
has
something
which
I
should
value
even
more
highly,"
said
Holmes.
"You
have
but
to
name
it."
"This
photograph!"
The
King
stared
at
him
in
amazement.
"Irene's
photograph!"
he
cried.
"Certainly,
if
you
wish
it."
"I
thank
your
Majesty.
Then
there
is
no
more
to
be
done
in
the
matter.
I
have
the
honour
to
wish
you
a
very
good-morning."
He
bowed,
and,
turning
away
without
observing
the
hand
which
the
King
had
stretched
out
to
him,
he
set
off
in
my
company
for
his
chambers.
And
that
was
how
a
great
scandal
threatened
to
affect
the
kingdom
of
Bohemia,
and
how
the
best
plans
of
Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes
were
beaten
by
a
woman's
wit.
He
used
to
make
merry
over
the
cleverness
of
women,
but
I
have
not
heard
him
do
it
of
late.
And
when
he
speaks
of
Irene
Adler,
or
when
he
refers
to
her
photograph,
it
is
always
under
the
honourable
title
of
the
woman.
ADVENTURE
II.
THE
RED-HEADED
LEAGUE
I
had
called
upon
my
friend,
Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes,
one
day
in
the
autumn
of
last
year
and
found
him
in
deep
conversation
with
a
very
stout,
florid-faced,
elderly
gentleman
with
fiery
red
hair.
With
an
apology
for
my
intrusion,
I
was
about
to
withdraw
when
Holmes
pulled
me
abruptly
into
the
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
me.
"You
could
not
possibly
have
come
at
a
better
time,
my
dear
Watson,"
he
said
cordially.
"I
was
afraid
that
you
were
engaged."
"So
I
am.
Very
much
so."
"Then
I
can
wait
in
the
next
room."
"Not
at
all.
This
gentleman,
Mr.
Wilson,
has
been
my
partner
and
helper
in
many
of
my
most
successful
cases,
and
I
have
no
doubt
that
he
will
be
of
the
utmost
use
to
me
in
yours
also."
The
stout
gentleman
half
rose
from
his
chair
and
gave
a
bob
of
greeting,
with
a
quick
little
questioning
glance
from
his
small
fat-encircled
eyes.
"Try
the
settee,"
said
Holmes,
relapsing
into
his
armchair
and
putting
his
fingertips
together,
as
was
his
custom
when
in
judicial
moods.
"I
know,
my
dear
Watson,
that
you
share
my
love
of
all
that
is
bizarre
and
outside
the
conventions
and
humdrum
routine
of
everyday
life.
You
have
shown
your
relish
for
it
by
the
enthusiasm
which
has
prompted
you
to
chronicle,
and,
if
you
will
excuse
my
saying
so,
somewhat
to
embellish
so
many
of
my
own
little
adventures."
"Your
cases
have
indeed
been
of
the
greatest
interest
to
me,"
I
observed.
"You
will
remember
that
I
remarked
the
other
day,
just
before
we
went
into
the
very
simple
problem
presented
by
Miss
Mary
Sutherland,
that
for
strange
effects
and
extraordinary
combinations
we
must
go
to
life
itself,
which
is
always
far
more
daring
than
any
effort
of
the
imagination."
"A
proposition
which
I
took
the
liberty
of
doubting."
"You
did,
Doctor,
but
none
the
less
you
must
come
round
to
my
view,
for
otherwise
I
shall
keep
on
piling
fact
upon
fact
on
you
until
your
reason
breaks
down
under
them
and
acknowledges
me
to
be
right.
Now,
Mr.
Jabez
Wilson
here
has
been
good
enough
to
call
upon
me
this
morning,
and
to
begin
a
narrative
which
promises
to
be
one
of
the
most
singular
which
I
have
listened
to
for
some
time.
You
have
heard
me
remark
that
the
strangest
and
most
unique
things
are
very
often
connected
not
with
the
larger
but
with
the
smaller
crimes,
and
occasionally,
indeed,
where
there
is
room
for
doubt
whether
any
positive
crime
has
been
committed.
As
far
as
I
have
heard
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
say
whether
the
present
case
is
an
instance
of
crime
or
not,
but
the
course
of
events
is
certainly
among
the
most
singular
that
I
have
ever
listened
to.
Perhaps,
Mr.
Wilson,
you
would
have
the
great
kindness
to
recommence
your
narrative.
I
ask
you
not
merely
because
my
friend
Dr.
Watson
has
not
heard
the
opening
part
but
also
because
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
story
makes
me
anxious
to
have
every
possible
detail
from
your
lips.
As
a
rule,
when
I
have
heard
some
slight
indication
of
the
course
of
events,
I
am
able
to
guide
myself
by
the
thousands
of
other
similar
cases
which
occur
to
my
memory.
In
the
present
instance
I
am
forced
to
admit
that
the
facts
are,
to
the
best
of
my
belief,
unique."
The
portly
client
puffed
out
his
chest
with
an
appearance
of
some
little
pride
and
pulled
a
dirty
and
wrinkled
newspaper
from
the
inside
pocket
of
his
greatcoat.
As
he
glanced
down
the
advertisement
column,
with
his
head
thrust
forward
and
the
paper
flattened
out
upon
his
knee,
I
took
a
good
look
at
the
man
and
endeavoured,
after
the
fashion
of
my
companion,
to
read
the
indications
which
might
be
presented
by
his
dress
or
appearance.
I
did
not
gain
very
much,
however,
by
my
inspection.
Our
visitor
bore
every
mark
of
being
an
average
commonplace
British
tradesman,
obese,
pompous,
and
slow.
He
wore
rather
baggy
grey
shepherd's
check
trousers,
a
not
over-clean
black
frock-coat,
unbuttoned
in
the
front,
and
a
drab
waistcoat
with
a
heavy
brassy
Albert
chain,
and
a
square
pierced
bit
of
metal
dangling
down
as
an
ornament.
A
frayed
top-hat
and
a
faded
brown
overcoat
with
a
wrinkled
velvet
collar
lay
upon
a
chair
beside
him.
Altogether,
look
as
I
would,
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
the
man
save
his
blazing
red
head,
and
the
expression
of
extreme
chagrin
and
discontent
upon
his
features.
Sherlock
Holmes'
quick
eye
took
in
my
occupation,
and
he
shook
his
head
with
a
smile
as
he
noticed
my
questioning
glances.
"Beyond
the
obvious
facts
that
he
has
at
some
time
done
manual
labour,
that
he
takes
snuff,
that
he
is
a
Freemason,
that
he
has
been
in
China,
and
that
he
has
done
a
considerable
amount
of
writing
lately,
I
can
deduce
nothing
else."
Mr.
Jabez
Wilson
started
up
in
his
chair,
with
his
forefinger
upon
the
paper,
but
his
eyes
upon
my
companion.
"How,
in
the
name
of
good-fortune,
did
you
know
all
that,
Mr.
Holmes?"
he
asked.
"How
did
you
know,
for
example,
that
I
did
manual
labour.
It's
as
true
as
gospel,
for
I
began
as
a
ship's
carpenter."
"Your
hands,
my
dear
sir.
Your
right
hand
is
quite
a
size
larger
than
your
left.
You
have
worked
with
it,
and
the
muscles
are
more
developed."
"Well,
the
snuff,
then,
and
the
Freemasonry?"
"I
won't
insult
your
intelligence
by
telling
you
how
I
read
that,
especially
as,
rather
against
the
strict
rules
of
your
order,
you
use
an
arc-and-compass
breastpin."
"Ah,
of
course,
I
forgot
that.
But
the
writing?"
"What
else
can
be
indicated
by
that
right
cuff
so
very
shiny
for
five
inches,
and
the
left
one
with
the
smooth
patch
near
the
elbow
where
you
rest
it
upon
the
desk?"
"Well,
but
China?"
"The
fish
that
you
have
tattooed
immediately
above
your
right
wrist
could
only
have
been
done
in
China.
I
have
made
a
small
study
of
tattoo
marks
and
have
even
contributed
to
the
literature
of
the
subject.
That
trick
of
staining
the
fishes'
scales
of
a
delicate
pink
is
quite
peculiar
to
China.
When,
in
addition,
I
see
a
Chinese
coin
hanging
from
your
watch-chain,
the
matter
becomes
even
more
simple."
Mr.
Jabez
Wilson
laughed
heavily.
"Well,
I
never!"
said
he.
"I
thought
at
first
that
you
had
done
something
clever,
but
I
see
that
there
was
nothing
in
it,
after
all."
"I
begin
to
think,
Watson,"
said
Holmes,
"that
I
make
a
mistake
in
explaining.
'Omne
ignotum
pro
magnifico,'
you
know,
and
my
poor
little
reputation,
such
as
it
is,
will
suffer
shipwreck
if
I
am
so
candid.
Can
you
not
find
the
advertisement,
Mr.
Wilson?"
"Yes,
I
have
got
it
now,"
he
answered
with
his
thick
red
finger
planted
halfway
down
the
column.
"Here
it
is.
This
is
what
began
it
all.
You
just
read
it
for
yourself,
sir."
I
took
the
paper
from
him
and
read
as
follows:
"TO
THE
RED-HEADED
LEAGUE:
On
account
of
the
bequest
of
the
late
Ezekiah
Hopkins,
of
Lebanon,
Pennsylvania,
U.
S.
A.,
there
is
now
another
vacancy
open
which
entitles
a
member
of
the
League
to
a
salary
of
4
pounds
a
week
for
purely
nominal
services.
All
red-headed
men
who
are
sound
in
body
and
mind
and
above
the
age
of
twenty-one
years,
are
eligible.
Apply
in
person
on
Monday,
at
eleven
o'clock,
to
Duncan
Ross,
at
the
offices
of
the
League,
7
Pope's
Court,
Fleet
Street."
"What
on
earth
does
this
mean?"
I
ejaculated
after
I
had
twice
read
over
the
extraordinary
announcement.
Holmes
chuckled
and
wriggled
in
his
chair,
as
was
his
habit
when
in
high
spirits.
"It
is
a
little
off
the
beaten
track,
isn't
it?"
said
he.
"And
now,
Mr.
Wilson,
off
you
go
at
scratch
and
tell
us
all
about
yourself,
your
household,
and
the
effect
which
this
advertisement
had
upon
your
fortunes.
You
will
first
make
a
note,
Doctor,
of
the
paper
and
the
date."
"It
is
The
Morning
Chronicle
of
April
27,
1890.
Just
two
months
ago."
"Very
good.
Now,
Mr.
Wilson?"
"Well,
it
is
just
as
I
have
been
telling
you,
Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes,"
said
Jabez
Wilson,
mopping
his
forehead;
"I
have
a
small
pawnbroker's
business
at
Coburg
Square,
near
the
City.
It's
not
a
very
large
affair,
and
of
late
years
it
has
not
done
more
than
just
give
me
a
living.
I
used
to
be
able
to
keep
two
assistants,
but
now
I
only
keep
one;
and
I
would
have
a
job
to
pay
him
but
that
he
is
willing
to
come
for
half
wages
so
as
to
learn
the
business."
"What
is
the
name
of
this
obliging
youth?"
asked
Sherlock
Holmes.
"His
name
is
Vincent
Spaulding,
and
he's
not
such
a
youth,
either.
It's
hard
to
say
his
age.
I
should
not
wish
a
smarter
assistant,
Mr.
Holmes;
and
I
know
very
well
that
he
could
better
himself
and
earn
twice
what
I
am
able
to
give
him.
But,
after
all,
if
he
is
satisfied,
why
should
I
put
ideas
in
his
head?"
"Why,
indeed?
You
seem
most
fortunate
in
having
an
employé
who
comes
under
the
full
market
price.
It
is
not
a
common
experience
among
employers
in
this
age.
I
don't
know
that
your
assistant
is
not
as
remarkable
as
your
advertisement."
"Oh,
he
has
his
faults,
too,"
said
Mr.
Wilson.
"Never
was
such
a
fellow
for
photography.
Snapping
away
with
a
camera
when
he
ought
to
be
improving
his
mind,
and
then
diving
down
into
the
cellar
like
a
rabbit
into
its
hole
to
develop
his
pictures.
That
is
his
main
fault,
but
on
the
whole
he's
a
good
worker.
There's
no
vice
in
him."
"He
is
still
with
you,
I
presume?"
"Yes,
sir.
He
and
a
girl
of
fourteen,
who
does
a
bit
of
simple
cooking
and
keeps
the
place
clean--that's
all
I
have
in
the
house,
for
I
am
a
widower
and
never
had
any
family.
We
live
very
quietly,
sir,
the
three
of
us;
and
we
keep
a
roof
over
our
heads
and
pay
our
debts,
if
we
do
nothing
more.
"The
first
thing
that
put
us
out
was
that
advertisement.
Spaulding,
he
came
down
into
the
office
just
this
day
eight
weeks,
with
this
very
paper
in
his
hand,
and
he
says:
"'I
wish
to
the
Lord,
Mr.
Wilson,
that
I
was
a
red-headed
man.'
"'Why
that?'
I
asks.
"'Why,'
says
he,
'here's
another
vacancy
on
the
League
of
the
Red-headed
Men.
It's
worth
quite
a
little
fortune
to
any
man
who
gets
it,
and
I
understand
that
there
are
more
vacancies
than
there
are
men,
so
that
the
trustees
are
at
their
wits'
end
what
to
do
with
the
money.
If
my
hair
would
only
change
colour,
here's
a
nice
little
crib
all
ready
for
me
to
step
into.'
"'Why,
what
is
it,
then?'
I
asked.
You
see,
Mr.
Holmes,
I
am
a
very
stay-at-home
man,
and
as
my
business
came
to
me
instead
of
my
having
to
go
to
it,
I
was
often
weeks
on
end
without
putting
my
foot
over
the
door-mat.
In
that
way
I
didn't
know
much
of
what
was
going
on
outside,
and
I
was
always
glad
of
a
bit
of
news.
"'Have
you
never
heard
of
the
League
of
the
Red-headed
Men?'
he
asked
with
his
eyes
open.
"'Never.'
"'Why,
I
wonder
at
that,
for
you
are
eligible
yourself
for
one
of
the
vacancies.'
"'And
what
are
they
worth?'
I
asked.
"'Oh,
merely
a
couple
of
hundred
a
year,
but
the
work
is
slight,
and
it
need
not
interfere
very
much
with
one's
other
occupations.'
"Well,
you
can
easily
think
that
that
made
me
prick
up
my
ears,
for
the
business
has
not
been
over-good
for
some
years,
and
an
extra
couple
of
hundred
would
have
been
very
handy.
"'Tell
me
all
about
it,'
said
I.
"'Well,'
said
he,
showing
me
the
advertisement,
'you
can
see
for
yourself
that
the
League
has
a
vacancy,
and
there
is
the
address
where
you
should
apply
for
particulars.
As
far
as
I
can
make
out,
the
League
was
founded
by
an
American
millionaire,
Ezekiah
Hopkins,
who
was
very
peculiar
in
his
ways.
He
was
himself
red-headed,
and
he
had
a
great
sympathy
for
all
red-headed
men;
so
when
he
died
it
was
found
that
he
had
left
his
enormous
fortune
in
the
hands
of
trustees,
with
instructions
to
apply
the
interest
to
the
providing
of
easy
berths
to
men
whose
hair
is
of
that
colour.
From
all
I
hear
it
is
splendid
pay
and
very
little
to
do.'
"'But,'
said
I,
'there
would
be
millions
of
red-headed
men
who
would
apply.'
"'Not
so
many
as
you
might
think,'
he
answered.
'You
see
it
is
really
confined
to
Londoners,
and
to
grown
men.
This
American
had
started
from
London
when
he
was
young,
and
he
wanted
to
do
the
old
town
a
good
turn.
Then,
again,
I
have
heard
it
is
no
use
your
applying
if
your
hair
is
light
red,
or
dark
red,
or
anything
but
real
bright,
blazing,
fiery
red.
Now,
if
you
cared
to
apply,
Mr.
Wilson,
you
would
just
walk
in;
but
perhaps
it
would
hardly
be
worth
your
while
to
put
yourself
out
of
the
way
for
the
sake
of
a
few
hundred
pounds.'
"Now,
it
is
a
fact,
gentlemen,
as
you
may
see
for
yourselves,
that
my
hair
is
of
a
very
full
and
rich
tint,
so
that
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
there
was
to
be
any
competition
in
the
matter
I
stood
as
good
a
chance
as
any
man
that
I
had
ever
met.
Vincent
Spaulding
seemed
to
know
so
much
about
it
that
I
thought
he
might
prove
useful,
so
I
just
ordered
him
to
put
up
the
shutters
for
the
day
and
to
come
right
away
with
me.
He
was
very
willing
to
have
a
holiday,
so
we
shut
the
business
up
and
started
off
for
the
address
that
was
given
us
in
the
advertisement.
"I
never
hope
to
see
such
a
sight
as
that
again,
Mr.
Holmes.
From
north,
south,
east,
and
west
every
man
who
had
a
shade
of
red
in
his
hair
had
tramped
into
the
city
to
answer
the
advertisement.
Fleet
Street
was
choked
with
red-headed
folk,
and
Pope's
Court
looked
like
a
coster's
orange
barrow.
I
should
not
have
thought
there
were
so
many
in
the
whole
country
as
were
brought
together
by
that
single
advertisement.
Every
shade
of
colour
they
were--straw,
lemon,
orange,
brick,
Irish-setter,
liver,
clay;
but,
as
Spaulding
said,
there
were
not
many
who
had
the
real
vivid
flame-coloured
tint.
When
I
saw
how
many
were
waiting,
I
would
have
given
it
up
in
despair;
but
Spaulding
would
not
hear
of
it.
How
he
did
it
I
could
not
imagine,
but
he
pushed
and
pulled
and
butted
until
he
got
me
through
the
crowd,
and
right
up
to
the
steps
which
led
to
the
office.
There
was
a
double
stream
upon
the
stair,
some
going
up
in
hope,
and
some
coming
back
dejected;
but
we
wedged
in
as
well
as
we
could
and
soon
found
ourselves
in
the
office."
"Your
experience
has
been
a
most
entertaining
one,"
remarked
Holmes
as
his
client
paused
and
refreshed
his
memory
with
a
huge
pinch
of
snuff.
"Pray
continue
your
very
interesting
statement."
"There
was
nothing
in
the
office
but
a
couple
of
wooden
chairs
and
a
deal
table,
behind
which
sat
a
small
man
with
a
head
that
was
even
redder
than
mine.
He
said
a
few
words
to
each
candidate
as
he
came
up,
and
then
he
always
managed
to
find
some
fault
in
them
which
would
disqualify
them.
Getting
a
vacancy
did
not
seem
to
be
such
a
very
easy
matter,
after
all.
However,
when
our
turn
came
the
little
man
was
much
more
favourable
to
me
than
to
any
of
the
others,
and
he
closed
the
door
as
we
entered,
so
that
he
might
have
a
private
word
with
us.
"'This
is
Mr.
Jabez
Wilson,'
said
my
assistant,
'and
he
is
willing
to
fill
a
vacancy
in
the
League.'
"'And
he
is
admirably
suited
for
it,'
the
other
answered.
'He
has
every
requirement.
I
cannot
recall
when
I
have
seen
anything
so
fine.'
He
took
a
step
backward,
cocked
his
head
on
one
side,
and
gazed
at
my
hair
until
I
felt
quite
bashful.
Then
suddenly
he
plunged
forward,
wrung
my
hand,
and
congratulated
me
warmly
on
my
success.
"'It
would
be
injustice
to
hesitate,'
said
he.
'You
will,
however,
I
am
sure,
excuse
me
for
taking
an
obvious
precaution.'
With
that
he
seized
my
hair
in
both
his
hands,
and
tugged
until
I
yelled
with
the
pain.
'There
is
water
in
your
eyes,'
said
he
as
he
released
me.
'I
perceive
that
all
is
as
it
should
be.
But
we
have
to
be
careful,
for
we
have
twice
been
deceived
by
wigs
and
once
by
paint.
I
could
tell
you
tales
of
cobbler's
wax
which
would
disgust
you
with
human
nature.'
He
stepped
over
to
the
window
and
shouted
through
it
at
the
top
of
his
voice
that
the
vacancy
was
filled.
A
groan
of
disappointment
came
up
from
below,
and
the
folk
all
trooped
away
in
different
directions
until
there
was
not
a
red-head
to
be
seen
except
my
own
and
that
of
the
manager.
"'My
name,'
said
he,
'is
Mr.
Duncan
Ross,
and
I
am
myself
one
of
the
pensioners
upon
the
fund
left
by
our
noble
benefactor.
Are
you
a
married
man,
Mr.
Wilson?
Have
you
a
family?'
"I
answered
that
I
had
not.
"His
face
fell
immediately.
"'Dear
me!'
he
said
gravely,
'that
is
very
serious
indeed!
I
am
sorry
to
hear
you
say
that.
The
fund
was,
of
course,
for
the
propagation
and
spread
of
the
red-heads
as
well
as
for
their
maintenance.
It
is
exceedingly
unfortunate
that
you
should
be
a
bachelor.'
"My
face
lengthened
at
this,
Mr.
Holmes,
for
I
thought
that
I
was
not
to
have
the
vacancy
after
all;
but
after
thinking
it
over
for
a
few
minutes
he
said
that
it
would
be
all
right.
"'In
the
case
of
another,'
said
he,
'the
objection
might
be
fatal,
but
we
must
stretch
a
point
in
favour
of
a
man
with
such
a
head
of
hair
as
yours.
When
shall
you
be
able
to
enter
upon
your
new
duties?'
"'Well,
it
is
a
little
awkward,
for
I
have
a
business
already,'
said
I.
"'Oh,
never
mind
about
that,
Mr.
Wilson!'
said
Vincent
Spaulding.
'I
should
be
able
to
look
after
that
for
you.'
"'What
would
be
the
hours?'
I
asked.
"'Ten
to
two.'
"Now
a
pawnbroker's
business
is
mostly
done
of
an
evening,
Mr.
Holmes,
especially
Thursday
and
Friday
evening,
which
is
just
before
pay-day;
so
it
would
suit
me
very
well
to
earn
a
little
in
the
mornings.
Besides,
I
knew
that
my
assistant
was
a
good
man,
and
that
he
would
see
to
anything
that
turned
up.
"'That
would
suit
me
very
well,'
said
I.
'And
the
pay?'
"'Is
4
pounds
a
week.'
"'And
the
work?'
"'Is
purely
nominal.'
"'What
do
you
call
purely
nominal?'
"'Well,
you
have
to
be
in
the
office,
or
at
least
in
the
building,
the
whole
time.
If
you
leave,
you
forfeit
your
whole
position
forever.
The
will
is
very
clear
upon
that
point.
You
don't
comply
with
the
conditions
if
you
budge
from
the
office
during
that
time.'
"'It's
only
four
hours
a
day,
and
I
should
not
think
of
leaving,'
said
I.
"'No
excuse
will
avail,'
said
Mr.
Duncan
Ross;
'neither
sickness
nor
business
nor
anything
else.
There
you
must
stay,
or
you
lose
your
billet.'
"'And
the
work?'
"'Is
to
copy
out
the
"Encyclopaedia
Britannica."
There
is
the
first
volume
of
it
in
that
press.
You
must
find
your
own
ink,
pens,
and
blotting-paper,
but
we
provide
this
table
and
chair.
Will
you
be
ready
to-morrow?'
"'Certainly,'
I
answered.
"'Then,
good-bye,
Mr.
Jabez
Wilson,
and
let
me
congratulate
you
once
more
on
the
important
position
which
you
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
gain.'
He
bowed
me
out
of
the
room
and
I
went
home
with
my
assistant,
hardly
knowing
what
to
say
or
do,
I
was
so
pleased
at
my
own
good
fortune.
"Well,
I
thought
over
the
matter
all
day,
and
by
evening
I
was
in
low
spirits
again;
for
I
had
quite
persuaded
myself
that
the
whole
affair
must
be
some
great
hoax
or
fraud,
though
what
its
object
might
be
I
could
not
imagine.
It
seemed
altogether
past
belief
that
anyone
could
make
such
a
will,
or
that
they
would
pay
such
a
sum
for
doing
anything
so
simple
as
copying
out
the
'Encyclopaedia
Britannica.'
Vincent
Spaulding
did
what
he
could
to
cheer
me
up,
but
by
bedtime
I
had
reasoned
myself
out
of
the
whole
thing.
However,
in
the
morning
I
determined
to
have
a
look
at
it
anyhow,
so
I
bought
a
penny
bottle
of
ink,
and
with
a
quill-pen,
and
seven
sheets
of
foolscap
paper,
I
started
off
for
Pope's
Court.
"Well,
to
my
surprise
and
delight,
everything
was
as
right
as
possible.
The
table
was
set
out
ready
for
me,
and
Mr.
Duncan
Ross
was
there
to
see
that
I
got
fairly
to
work.
He
started
me
off
upon
the
letter
A,
and
then
he
left
me;
but
he
would
drop
in
from
time
to
time
to
see
that
all
was
right
with
me.
At
two
o'clock
he
bade
me
good-day,
complimented
me
upon
the
amount
that
I
had
written,
and
locked
the
door
of
the
office
after
me.
"This
went
on
day
after
day,
Mr.
Holmes,
and
on
Saturday
the
manager
came
in
and
planked
down
four
golden
sovereigns
for
my
week's
work.
It
was
the
same
next
week,
and
the
same
the
week
after.
Every
morning
I
was
there
at
ten,
and
every
afternoon
I
left
at
two.
By
degrees
Mr.
Duncan
Ross
took
to
coming
in
only
once
of
a
morning,
and
then,
after
a
time,
he
did
not
come
in
at
all.
Still,
of
course,
I
never
dared
to
leave
the
room
for
an
instant,
for
I
was
not
sure
when
he
might
come,
and
the
billet
was
such
a
good
one,
and
suited
me
so
well,
that
I
would
not
risk
the
loss
of
it.
"Eight
weeks
passed
away
like
this,
and
I
had
written
about
Abbots
and
Archery
and
Armour
and
Architecture
and
Attica,
and
hoped
with
diligence
that
I
might
get
on
to
the
B's
before
very
long.
It
cost
me
something
in
foolscap,
and
I
had
pretty
nearly
filled
a
shelf
with
my
writings.
And
then
suddenly
the
whole
business
came
to
an
end."
"To
an
end?"
"Yes,
sir.
And
no
later
than
this
morning.
I
went
to
my
work
as
usual
at
ten
o'clock,
but
the
door
was
shut
and
locked,
with
a
little
square
of
cardboard
hammered
on
to
the
middle
of
the
panel
with
a
tack.
Here
it
is,
and
you
can
read
for
yourself."
He
held
up
a
piece
of
white
cardboard
about
the
size
of
a
sheet
of
note-paper.
It
read
in
this
fashion:
THE
RED-HEADED
LEAGUE
IS
DISSOLVED.
October
9,
1890.
Sherlock
Holmes
and
I
surveyed
this
curt
announcement
and
the
rueful
face
behind
it,
until
the
comical
side
of
the
affair
so
completely
overtopped
every
other
consideration
that
we
both
burst
out
into
a
roar
of
laughter.
"I
cannot
see
that
there
is
anything
very
funny,"
cried
our
client,
flushing
up
to
the
roots
of
his
flaming
head.
"If
you
can
do
nothing
better
than
laugh
at
me,
I
can
go
elsewhere."
"No,
no,"
cried
Holmes,
shoving
him
back
into
the
chair
from
which
he
had
half
risen.
"I
really
wouldn't
miss
your
case
for
the
world.
It
is
most
refreshingly
unusual.
But
there
is,
if
you
will
excuse
my
saying
so,
something
just
a
little
funny
about
it.
Pray
what
steps
did
you
take
when
you
found
the
card
upon
the
door?"
"I
was
staggered,
sir.
I
did
not
know
what
to
do.
Then
I
called
at
the
offices
round,
but
none
of
them
seemed
to
know
anything
about
it.
Finally,
I
went
to
the
landlord,
who
is
an
accountant
living
on
the
ground-floor,
and
I
asked
him
if
he
could
tell
me
what
had
become
of
the
Red-headed
League.
He
said
that
he
had
never
heard
of
any
such
body.
Then
I
asked
him
who
Mr.
Duncan
Ross
was.
He
answered
that
the
name
was
new
to
him.
"'Well,'
said
I,
'the
gentleman
at
No.
4.'
"'What,
the
red-headed
man?'
"'Yes.'
"'Oh,'
said
he,
'his
name
was
William
Morris.
He
was
a
solicitor
and
was
using
my
room
as
a
temporary
convenience
until
his
new
premises
were
ready.
He
moved
out
yesterday.'
"'Where
could
I
find
him?'
"'Oh,
at
his
new
offices.
He
did
tell
me
the
address.
Yes,
17
King
Edward
Street,
near
St.
Paul's.'
"I
started
off,
Mr.
Holmes,
but
when
I
got
to
that
address
it
was
a
manufactory
of
artificial
knee-caps,
and
no
one
in
it
had
ever
heard
of
either
Mr.
William
Morris
or
Mr.
Duncan
Ross."
"And
what
did
you
do
then?"
asked
Holmes.
"I
went
home
to
Saxe-Coburg
Square,
and
I
took
the
advice
of
my
assistant.
But
he
could
not
help
me
in
any
way.
He
could
only
say
that
if
I
waited
I
should
hear
by
post.
But
that
was
not
quite
good
enough,
Mr.
Holmes.
I
did
not
wish
to
lose
such
a
place
without
a
struggle,
so,
as
I
had
heard
that
you
were
good
enough
to
give
advice
to
poor
folk
who
were
in
need
of
it,
I
came
right
away
to
you."
"And
you
did
very
wisely,"
said
Holmes.
"Your
case
is
an
exceedingly
remarkable
one,
and
I
shall
be
happy
to
look
into
it.
From
what
you
have
told
me
I
think
that
it
is
possible
that
graver
issues
hang
from
it
than
might
at
first
sight
appear."
"Grave
enough!"
said
Mr.
Jabez
Wilson.
"Why,
I
have
lost
four
pound
a
week."
"As
far
as
you
are
personally
concerned,"
remarked
Holmes,
"I
do
not
see
that
you
have
any
grievance
against
this
extraordinary
league.
On
the
contrary,
you
are,
as
I
understand,
richer
by
some
30
pounds,
to
say
nothing
of
the
minute
knowledge
which
you
have
gained
on
every
subject
which
comes
under
the
letter
A.
You
have
lost
nothing
by
them."
"No,
sir.
But
I
want
to
find
out
about
them,
and
who
they
are,
and
what
their
object
was
in
playing
this
prank--if
it
was
a
prank--upon
me.
It
was
a
pretty
expensive
joke
for
them,
for
it
cost
them
two
and
thirty
pounds."
"We
shall
endeavour
to
clear
up
these
points
for
you.
And,
first,
one
or
two
questions,
Mr.
Wilson.
This
assistant
of
yours
who
first
called
your
attention
to
the
advertisement--how
long
had
he
been
with
you?"
"About
a
month
then."
"How
did
he
come?"
"In
answer
to
an
advertisement."
"Was
he
the
only
applicant?"
"No,
I
had
a
dozen."
"Why
did
you
pick
him?"
"Because
he
was
handy
and
would
come
cheap."
"At
half-wages,
in
fact."
"Yes."
"What
is
he
like,
this
Vincent
Spaulding?"
"Small,
stout-built,
very
quick
in
his
ways,
no
hair
on
his
face,
though
he's
not
short
of
thirty.
Has
a
white
splash
of
acid
upon
his
forehead."
Holmes
sat
up
in
his
chair
in
considerable
excitement.
"I
thought
as
much,"
said
he.
"Have
you
ever
observed
that
his
ears
are
pierced
for
earrings?"
"Yes,
sir.
He
told
me
that
a
gipsy
had
done
it
for
him
when
he
was
a
lad."
"Hum!"
said
Holmes,
sinking
back
in
deep
thought.
"He
is
still
with
you?"
"Oh,
yes,
sir;
I
have
only
just
left
him."
"And
has
your
business
been
attended
to
in
your
absence?"
"Nothing
to
complain
of,
sir.
There's
never
very
much
to
do
of
a
morning."
"That
will
do,
Mr.
Wilson.
I
shall
be
happy
to
give
you
an
opinion
upon
the
subject
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
two.
To-day
is
Saturday,
and
I
hope
that
by
Monday
we
may
come
to
a
conclusion."
"Well,
Watson,"
said
Holmes
when
our
visitor
had
left
us,
"what
do
you
make
of
it
all?"
"I
make
nothing
of
it,"
I
answered
frankly.
"It
is
a
most
mysterious
business."
"As
a
rule,"
said
Holmes,
"the
more
bizarre
a
thing
is
the
less
mysterious
it
proves
to
be.
It
is
your
commonplace,
featureless
crimes
which
are
really
puzzling,
just
as
a
commonplace
face
is
the
most
difficult
to
identify.
But
I
must
be
prompt
over
this
matter."
"What
are
you
going
to
do,
then?"
I
asked.
"To
smoke,"
he
answered.
"It
is
quite
a
three
pipe
problem,
and
I
beg
that
you
won't
speak
to
me
for
fifty
minutes."
He
curled
himself
up
in
his
chair,
with
his
thin
knees
drawn
up
to
his
hawk-like
nose,
and
there
he
sat
with
his
eyes
closed
and
his
black
clay
pipe
thrusting
out
like
the
bill
of
some
strange
bird.
I
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
dropped
asleep,
and
indeed
was
nodding
myself,
when
he
suddenly
sprang
out
of
his
chair
with
the
gesture
of
a
man
who
has
made
up
his
mind
and
put
his
pipe
down
upon
the
mantelpiece.
"Sarasate
plays
at
the
St.
James's
Hall
this
afternoon,"
he
remarked.
"What
do
you
think,
Watson?
Could
your
patients
spare
you
for
a
few
hours?"
"I
have
nothing
to
do
to-day.
My
practice
is
never
very
absorbing."
"Then
put
on
your
hat
and
come.
I
am
going
through
the
City
first,
and
we
can
have
some
lunch
on
the
way.
I
observe
that
there
is
a
good
deal
of
German
music
on
the
programme,
which
is
rather
more
to
my
taste
than
Italian
or
French.
It
is
introspective,
and
I
want
to
introspect.
Come
along!"
We
travelled
by
the
Underground
as
far
as
Aldersgate;
and
a
short
walk
took
us
to
Saxe-Coburg
Square,
the
scene
of
the
singular
story
which
we
had
listened
to
in
the
morning.
It
was
a
poky,
little,
shabby-genteel
place,
where
four
lines
of
dingy
two-storied
brick
houses
looked
out
into
a
small
railed-in
enclosure,
where
a
lawn
of
weedy
grass
and
a
few
clumps
of
faded
laurel-bushes
made
a
hard
fight
against
a
smoke-laden
and
uncongenial
atmosphere.
Three
gilt
balls
and
a
brown
board
with
"JABEZ
WILSON"
in
white
letters,
upon
a
corner
house,
announced
the
place
where
our
red-headed
client
carried
on
his
business.
Sherlock
Holmes
stopped
in
front
of
it
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
looked
it
all
over,
with
his
eyes
shining
brightly
between
puckered
lids.
Then
he
walked
slowly
up
the
street,
and
then
down
again
to
the
corner,
still
looking
keenly
at
the
houses.
Finally
he
returned
to
the
pawnbroker's,
and,
having
thumped
vigorously
upon
the
pavement
with
his
stick
two
or
three
times,
he
went
up
to
the
door
and
knocked.
It
was
instantly
opened
by
a
bright-looking,
clean-shaven
young
fellow,
who
asked
him
to
step
in.
"Thank
you,"
said
Holmes,
"I
only
wished
to
ask
you
how
you
would
go
from
here
to
the
Strand."
"Third
right,
fourth
left,"
answered
the
assistant
promptly,
closing
the
door.
"Smart
fellow,
that,"
observed
Holmes
as
we
walked
away.
"He
is,
in
my
judgment,
the
fourth
smartest
man
in
London,
and
for
daring
I
am
not
sure
that
he
has
not
a
claim
to
be
third.
I
have
known
something
of
him
before."
"Evidently,"
said
I,
"Mr.
Wilson's
assistant
counts
for
a
good
deal
in
this
mystery
of
the
Red-headed
League.
I
am
sure
that
you
inquired
your
way
merely
in
order
that
you
might
see
him."
"Not
him."
"What
then?"
"The
knees
of
his
trousers."
"And
what
did
you
see?"
"What
I
expected
to
see."
"Why
did
you
beat
the
pavement?"
"My
dear
doctor,
this
is
a
time
for
observation,
not
for
talk.
We
are
spies
in
an
enemy's
country.
We
know
something
of
Saxe-Coburg
Square.
Let
us
now
explore
the
parts
which
lie
behind
it."
The
road
in
which
we
found
ourselves
as
we
turned
round
the
corner
from
the
retired
Saxe-Coburg
Square
presented
as
great
a
contrast
to
it
as
the
front
of
a
picture
does
to
the
back.
It
was
one
of
the
main
arteries
which
conveyed
the
traffic
of
the
City
to
the
north
and
west.
The
roadway
was
blocked
with
the
immense
stream
of
commerce
flowing
in
a
double
tide
inward
and
outward,
while
the
footpaths
were
black
with
the
hurrying
swarm
of
pedestrians.
It
was
difficult
to
realise
as
we
looked
at
the
line
of
fine
shops
and
stately
business
premises
that
they
really
abutted
on
the
other
side
upon
the
faded
and
stagnant
square
which
we
had
just
quitted.
"Let
me
see,"
said
Holmes,
standing
at
the
corner
and
glancing
along
the
line,
"I
should
like
just
to
remember
the
order
of
the
houses
here.
It
is
a
hobby
of
mine
to
have
an
exact
knowledge
of
London.
There
is
Mortimer's,
the
tobacconist,
the
little
newspaper
shop,
the
Coburg
branch
of
the
City
and
Suburban
Bank,
the
Vegetarian
Restaurant,
and
McFarlane's
carriage-building
depot.
That
carries
us
right
on
to
the
other
block.
And
now,
Doctor,
we've
done
our
work,
so
it's
time
we
had
some
play.
A
sandwich
and
a
cup
of
coffee,
and
then
off
to
violin-land,
where
all
is
sweetness
and
delicacy
and
harmony,
and
there
are
no
red-headed
clients
to
vex
us
with
their
conundrums."
My
friend
was
an
enthusiastic
musician,
being
himself
not
only
a
very
capable
performer
but
a
composer
of
no
ordinary
merit.
All
the
afternoon
he
sat
in
the
stalls
wrapped
in
the
most
perfect
happiness,
gently
waving
his
long,
thin
fingers
in
time
to
the
music,
while
his
gently
smiling
face
and
his
languid,
dreamy
eyes
were
as
unlike
those
of
Holmes
the
sleuth-hound,
Holmes
the
relentless,
keen-witted,
ready-handed
criminal
agent,
as
it
was
possible
to
conceive.
In
his
singular
character
the
dual
nature
alternately
asserted
itself,
and
his
extreme
exactness
and
astuteness
represented,
as
I
have
often
thought,
the
reaction
against
the
poetic
and
contemplative
mood
which
occasionally
predominated
in
him.
The
swing
of
his
nature
took
him
from
extreme
languor
to
devouring
energy;
and,
as
I
knew
well,
he
was
never
so
truly
formidable
as
when,
for
days
on
end,
he
had
been
lounging
in
his
armchair
amid
his
improvisations
and
his
black-letter
editions.
Then
it
was
that
the
lust
of
the
chase
would
suddenly
come
upon
him,
and
that
his
brilliant
reasoning
power
would
rise
to
the
level
of
intuition,
until
those
who
were
unacquainted
with
his
methods
would
look
askance
at
him
as
on
a
man
whose
knowledge
was
not
that
of
other
mortals.
When
I
saw
him
that
afternoon
so
enwrapped
in
the
music
at
St.
James's
Hall
I
felt
that
an
evil
time
might
be
coming
upon
those
whom
he
had
set
himself
to
hunt
down.
"You
want
to
go
home,
no
doubt,
Doctor,"
he
remarked
as
we
emerged.
"Yes,
it
would
be
as
well."
"And
I
have
some
business
to
do
which
will
take
some
hours.
This
business
at
Coburg
Square
is
serious."
"Why
serious?"
"A
considerable
crime
is
in
contemplation.
I
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
we
shall
be
in
time
to
stop
it.
But
to-day
being
Saturday
rather
complicates
matters.
I
shall
want
your
help
to-night."
"At
what
time?"
"Ten
will
be
early
enough."
"I
shall
be
at
Baker
Street
at
ten."
"Very
well.
And,
I
say,
Doctor,
there
may
be
some
little
danger,
so
kindly
put
your
army
revolver
in
your
pocket."
He
waved
his
hand,
turned
on
his
heel,
and
disappeared
in
an
instant
among
the
crowd.
I
trust
that
I
am
not
more
dense
than
my
neighbours,
but
I
was
always
oppressed
with
a
sense
of
my
own
stupidity
in
my
dealings
with
Sherlock
Holmes.
Here
I
had
heard
what
he
had
heard,
I
had
seen
what
he
had
seen,
and
yet
from
his
words
it
was
evident
that
he
saw
clearly
not
only
what
had
happened
but
what
was
about
to
happen,
while
to
me
the
whole
business
was
still
confused
and
grotesque.
As
I
drove
home
to
my
house
in
Kensington
I
thought
over
it
all,
from
the
extraordinary
story
of
the
red-headed
copier
of
the
"Encyclopaedia"
down
to
the
visit
to
Saxe-Coburg
Square,
and
the
ominous
words
with
which
he
had
parted
from
me.
What
was
this
nocturnal
expedition,
and
why
should
I
go
armed?
Where
were
we
going,
and
what
were
we
to
do?
I
had
the
hint
from
Holmes
that
this
smooth-faced
pawnbroker's
assistant
was
a
formidable
man--a
man
who
might
play
a
deep
game.
I
tried
to
puzzle
it
out,
but
gave
it
up
in
despair
and
set
the
matter
aside
until
night
should
bring
an
explanation.
It
was
a
quarter-past
nine
when
I
started
from
home
and
made
my
way
across
the
Park,
and
so
through
Oxford
Street
to
Baker
Street.
Two
hansoms
were
standing
at
the
door,
and
as
I
entered
the
passage
I
heard
the
sound
of
voices
from
above.
On
entering
his
room
I
found
Holmes
in
animated
conversation
with
two
men,
one
of
whom
I
recognised
as
Peter
Jones,
the
official
police
agent,
while
the
other
was
a
long,
thin,
sad-faced
man,
with
a
very
shiny
hat
and
oppressively
respectable
frock-coat.
"Ha!
Our
party
is
complete,"
said
Holmes,
buttoning
up
his
pea-jacket
and
taking
his
heavy
hunting
crop
from
the
rack.
"Watson,
I
think
you
know
Mr.
Jones,
of
Scotland
Yard?
Let
me
introduce
you
to
Mr.
Merryweather,
who
is
to
be
our
companion
in
to-night's
adventure."
"We're
hunting
in
couples
again,
Doctor,
you
see,"
said
Jones
in
his
consequential
way.
"Our
friend
here
is
a
wonderful
man
for
starting
a
chase.
All
he
wants
is
an
old
dog
to
help
him
to
do
the
running
down."
"I
hope
a
wild
goose
may
not
prove
to
be
the
end
of
our
chase,"
observed
Mr.
Merryweather
gloomily.
"You
may
place
considerable
confidence
in
Mr.
Holmes,
sir,"
said
the
police
agent
loftily.
"He
has
his
own
little
methods,
which
are,
if
he
won't
mind
my
saying
so,
just
a
little
too
theoretical
and
fantastic,
but
he
has
the
makings
of
a
detective
in
him.
It
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
once
or
twice,
as
in
that
business
of
the
Sholto
murder
and
the
Agra
treasure,
he
has
been
more
nearly
correct
than
the
official
force."
"Oh,
if
you
say
so,
Mr.
Jones,
it
is
all
right,"
said
the
stranger
with
deference.
"Still,
I
confess
that
I
miss
my
rubber.
It
is
the
first
Saturday
night
for
seven-and-twenty
years
that
I
have
not
had
my
rubber."
"I
think
you
will
find,"
said
Sherlock
Holmes,
"that
you
will
play
for
a
higher
stake
to-night
than
you
have
ever
done
yet,
and
that
the
play
will
be
more
exciting.
For
you,
Mr.
Merryweather,
the
stake
will
be
some
30,000
pounds;
and
for
you,
Jones,
it
will
be
the
man
upon
whom
you
wish
to
lay
your
hands."
"John
Clay,
the
murderer,
thief,
smasher,
and
forger.
He's
a
young
man,
Mr.
Merryweather,
but
he
is
at
the
head
of
his
profession,
and
I
would
rather
have
my
bracelets
on
him
than
on
any
criminal
in
London.
He's
a
remarkable
man,
is
young
John
Clay.
His
grandfather
was
a
royal
duke,
and
he
himself
has
been
to
Eton
and
Oxford.
His
brain
is
as
cunning
as
his
fingers,
and
though
we
meet
signs
of
him
at
every
turn,
we
never
know
where
to
find
the
man
himself.
He'll
crack
a
crib
in
Scotland
one
week,
and
be
raising
money
to
build
an
orphanage
in
Cornwall
the
next.
I've
been
on
his
track
for
years
and
have
never
set
eyes
on
him
yet."
"I
hope
that
I
may
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
you
to-night.
I've
had
one
or
two
little
turns
also
with
Mr.
John
Clay,
and
I
agree
with
you
that
he
is
at
the
head
of
his
profession.
It
is
past
ten,
however,
and
quite
time
that
we
started.
If
you
two
will
take
the
first
hansom,
Watson
and
I
will
follow
in
the
second."
Sherlock
Holmes
was
not
very
communicative
during
the
long
drive
and
lay
back
in
the
cab
humming
the
tunes
which
he
had
heard
in
the
afternoon.
We
rattled
through
an
endless
labyrinth
of
gas-lit
streets
until
we
emerged
into
Farrington
Street.
"We
are
close
there
now,"
my
friend
remarked.
"This
fellow
Merryweather
is
a
bank
director,
and
personally
interested
in
the
matter.
I
thought
it
as
well
to
have
Jones
with
us
also.
He
is
not
a
bad
fellow,
though
an
absolute
imbecile
in
his
profession.
He
has
one
positive
virtue.
He
is
as
brave
as
a
bulldog
and
as
tenacious
as
a
lobster
if
he
gets
his
claws
upon
anyone.
Here
we
are,
and
they
are
waiting
for
us."
We
had
reached
the
same
crowded
thoroughfare
in
which
we
had
found
ourselves
in
the
morning.
Our
cabs
were
dismissed,
and,
following
the
guidance
of
Mr.
Merryweather,
we
passed
down
a
narrow
passage
and
through
a
side
door,
which
he
opened
for
us.
Within
there
was
a
small
corridor,
which
ended
in
a
very
massive
iron
gate.
This
also
was
opened,
and
led
down
a
flight
of
winding
stone
steps,
which
terminated
at
another
formidable
gate.
Mr.
Merryweather
stopped
to
light
a
lantern,
and
then
conducted
us
down
a
dark,
earth-smelling
passage,
and
so,
after
opening
a
third
door,
into
a
huge
vault
or
cellar,
which
was
piled
all
round
with
crates
and
massive
boxes.
"You
are
not
very
vulnerable
from
above,"
Holmes
remarked
as
he
held
up
the
lantern
and
gazed
about
him.
"Nor
from
below,"
said
Mr.
Merryweather,
striking
his
stick
upon
the
flags
which
lined
the
floor.
"Why,
dear
me,
it
sounds
quite
hollow!"
he
remarked,
looking
up
in
surprise.
"I
must
really
ask
you
to
be
a
little
more
quiet!"
said
Holmes
severely.
"You
have
already
imperilled
the
whole
success
of
our
expedition.
Might
I
beg
that
you
would
have
the
goodness
to
sit
down
upon
one
of
those
boxes,
and
not
to
interfere?"
The
solemn
Mr.
Merryweather
perched
himself
upon
a
crate,
with
a
very
injured
expression
upon
his
face,
while
Holmes
fell
upon
his
knees
upon
the
floor
and,
with
the
lantern
and
a
magnifying
lens,
began
to
examine
minutely
the
cracks
between
the
stones.
A
few
seconds
sufficed
to
satisfy
him,
for
he
sprang
to
his
feet
again
and
put
his
glass
in
his
pocket.
"We
have
at
least
an
hour
before
us,"
he
remarked,
"for
they
can
hardly
take
any
steps
until
the
good
pawnbroker
is
safely
in
bed.
Then
they
will
not
lose
a
minute,
for
the
sooner
they
do
their
work
the
longer
time
they
will
have
for
their
escape.
We
are
at
present,
Doctor--as
no
doubt
you
have
divined--in
the
cellar
of
the
City
branch
of
one
of
the
principal
London
banks.
Mr.
Merryweather
is
the
chairman
of
directors,
and
he
will
explain
to
you
that
there
are
reasons
why
the
more
daring
criminals
of
London
should
take
a
considerable
interest
in
this
cellar
at
present."
"It
is
our
French
gold,"
whispered
the
director.
"We
have
had
several
warnings
that
an
attempt
might
be
made
upon
it."
"Your
French
gold?"
"Yes.
We
had
occasion
some
months
ago
to
strengthen
our
resources
and
borrowed
for
that
purpose
30,000
napoleons
from
the
Bank
of
France.
It
has
become
known
that
we
have
never
had
occasion
to
unpack
the
money,
and
that
it
is
still
lying
in
our
cellar.
The
crate
upon
which
I
sit
contains
2,000
napoleons
packed
between
layers
of
lead
foil.
Our
reserve
of
bullion
is
much
larger
at
present
than
is
usually
kept
in
a
single
branch
office,
and
the
directors
have
had
misgivings
upon
the
subject."
"Which
were
very
well
justified,"
observed
Holmes.
"And
now
it
is
time
that
we
arranged
our
little
plans.
I
expect
that
within
an
hour
matters
will
come
to
a
head.
In
the
meantime
Mr.
Merryweather,
we
must
put
the
screen
over
that
dark
lantern."
"And
sit
in
the
dark?"
"I
am
afraid
so.
I
had
brought
a
pack
of
cards
in
my
pocket,
and
I
thought
that,
as
we
were
a
partie
carrée,
you
might
have
your
rubber
after
all.
But
I
see
that
the
enemy's
preparations
have
gone
so
far
that
we
cannot
risk
the
presence
of
a
light.
And,
first
of
all,
we
must
choose
our
positions.
These
are
daring
men,
and
though
we
shall
take
them
at
a
disadvantage,
they
may
do
us
some
harm
unless
we
are
careful.
I
shall
stand
behind
this
crate,
and
do
you
conceal
yourselves
behind
those.
Then,
when
I
flash
a
light
upon
them,
close
in
swiftly.
If
they
fire,
Watson,
have
no
compunction
about
shooting
them
down."
I
placed
my
revolver,
cocked,
upon
the
top
of
the
wooden
case
behind
which
I
crouched.
Holmes
shot
the
slide
across
the
front
of
his
lantern
and
left
us
in
pitch
darkness--such
an
absolute
darkness
as
I
have
never
before
experienced.
The
smell
of
hot
metal
remained
to
assure
us
that
the
light
was
still
there,
ready
to
flash
out
at
a
moment's
notice.
To
me,
with
my
nerves
worked
up
to
a
pitch
of
expectancy,
there
was
something
depressing
and
subduing
in
the
sudden
gloom,
and
in
the
cold
dank
air
of
the
vault.
"They
have
but
one
retreat,"
whispered
Holmes.
"That
is
back
through
the
house
into
Saxe-Coburg
Square.
I
hope
that
you
have
done
what
I
asked
you,
Jones?"
"I
have
an
inspector
and
two
officers
waiting
at
the
front
door."
"Then
we
have
stopped
all
the
holes.
And
now
we
must
be
silent
and
wait."
What
a
time
it
seemed!
From
comparing
notes
afterwards
it
was
but
an
hour
and
a
quarter,
yet
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
night
must
have
almost
gone
and
the
dawn
be
breaking
above
us.
My
limbs
were
weary
and
stiff,
for
I
feared
to
change
my
position;
yet
my
nerves
were
worked
up
to
the
highest
pitch
of
tension,
and
my
hearing
was
so
acute
that
I
could
not
only
hear
the
gentle
breathing
of
my
companions,
but
I
could
distinguish
the
deeper,
heavier
in-breath
of
the
bulky
Jones
from
the
thin,
sighing
note
of
the
bank
director.
From
my
position
I
could
look
over
the
case
in
the
direction
of
the
floor.
Suddenly
my
eyes
caught
the
glint
of
a
light.
At
first
it
was
but
a
lurid
spark
upon
the
stone
pavement.
Then
it
lengthened
out
until
it
became
a
yellow
line,
and
then,
without
any
warning
or
sound,
a
gash
seemed
to
open
and
a
hand
appeared,
a
white,
almost
womanly
hand,
which
felt
about
in
the
centre
of
the
little
area
of
light.
For
a
minute
or
more
the
hand,
with
its
writhing
fingers,
protruded
out
of
the
floor.
Then
it
was
withdrawn
as
suddenly
as
it
appeared,
and
all
was
dark
again
save
the
single
lurid
spark
which
marked
a
chink
between
the
stones.
Its
disappearance,
however,
was
but
momentary.
With
a
rending,
tearing
sound,
one
of
the
broad,
white
stones
turned
over
upon
its
side
and
left
a
square,
gaping
hole,
through
which
streamed
the
light
of
a
lantern.
Over
the
edge
there
peeped
a
clean-cut,
boyish
face,
which
looked
keenly
about
it,
and
then,
with
a
hand
on
either
side
of
the
aperture,
drew
itself
shoulder-high
and
waist-high,
until
one
knee
rested
upon
the
edge.
In
another
instant
he
stood
at
the
side
of
the
hole
and
was
hauling
after
him
a
companion,
lithe
and
small
like
himself,
with
a
pale
face
and
a
shock
of
very
red
hair.
"It's
all
clear,"
he
whispered.
"Have
you
the
chisel
and
the
bags?
Great
Scott!
Jump,
Archie,
jump,
and
I'll
swing
for
it!"
Sherlock
Holmes
had
sprung
out
and
seized
the
intruder
by
the
collar.
The
other
dived
down
the
hole,
and
I
heard
the
sound
of
rending
cloth
as
Jones
clutched
at
his
skirts.
The
light
flashed
upon
the
barrel
of
a
revolver,
but
Holmes'
hunting
crop
came
down
on
the
man's
wrist,
and
the
pistol
clinked
upon
the
stone
floor.
"It's
no
use,
John
Clay,"
said
Holmes
blandly.
"You
have
no
chance
at
all."
"So
I
see,"
the
other
answered
with
the
utmost
coolness.
"I
fancy
that
my
pal
is
all
right,
though
I
see
you
have
got
his
coat-tails."
"There
are
three
men
waiting
for
him
at
the
door,"
said
Holmes.
"Oh,
indeed!
You
seem
to
have
done
the
thing
very
completely.
I
must
compliment
you."
"And
I
you,"
Holmes
answered.
"Your
red-headed
idea
was
very
new
and
effective."
"You'll
see
your
pal
again
presently,"
said
Jones.
"He's
quicker
at
climbing
down
holes
than
I
am.
Just
hold
out
while
I
fix
the
derbies."
"I
beg
that
you
will
not
touch
me
with
your
filthy
hands,"
remarked
our
prisoner
as
the
handcuffs
clattered
upon
his
wrists.
"You
may
not
be
aware
that
I
have
royal
blood
in
my
veins.
Have
the
goodness,
also,
when
you
address
me
always
to
say
'sir'
and
'please.'"
"All
right,"
said
Jones
with
a
stare
and
a
snigger.
"Well,
would
you
please,
sir,
march
upstairs,
where
we
can
get
a
cab
to
carry
your
Highness
to
the
police-station?"
"That
is
better,"
said
John
Clay
serenely.
He
made
a
sweeping
bow
to
the
three
of
us
and
walked
quietly
off
in
the
custody
of
the
detective.
"Really,
Mr.
Holmes,"
said
Mr.
Merryweather
as
we
followed
them
from
the
cellar,
"I
do
not
know
how
the
bank
can
thank
you
or
repay
you.
There
is
no
doubt
that
you
have
detected
and
defeated
in
the
most
complete
manner
one
of
the
most
determined
attempts
at
bank
robbery
that
have
ever
come
within
my
experience."
"I
have
had
one
or
two
little
scores
of
my
own
to
settle
with
Mr.
John
Clay,"
said
Holmes.
"I
have
been
at
some
small
expense
over
this
matter,
which
I
shall
expect
the
bank
to
refund,
but
beyond
that
I
am
amply
repaid
by
having
had
an
experience
which
is
in
many
ways
unique,
and
by
hearing
the
very
remarkable
narrative
of
the
Red-headed
League."
"You
see,
Watson,"
he
explained
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
as
we
sat
over
a
glass
of
whisky
and
soda
in
Baker
Street,
"it
was
perfectly
obvious
from
the
first
that
the
only
possible
object
of
this
rather
fantastic
business
of
the
advertisement
of
the
League,
and
the
copying
of
the
'Encyclopaedia,'
must
be
to
get
this
not
over-bright
pawnbroker
out
of
the
way
for
a
number
of
hours
every
day.
It
was
a
curious
way
of
managing
it,
but,
really,
it
would
be
difficult
to
suggest
a
better.
The
method
was
no
doubt
suggested
to
Clay's
ingenious
mind
by
the
colour
of
his
accomplice's
hair.
The
4
pounds
a
week
was
a
lure
which
must
draw
him,
and
what
was
it
to
them,
who
were
playing
for
thousands?
They
put
in
the
advertisement,
one
rogue
has
the
temporary
office,
the
other
rogue
incites
the
man
to
apply
for
it,
and
together
they
manage
to
secure
his
absence
every
morning
in
the
week.
From
the
time
that
I
heard
of
the
assistant
having
come
for
half
wages,
it
was
obvious
to
me
that
he
had
some
strong
motive
for
securing
the
situation."
"But
how
could
you
guess
what
the
motive
was?"
"Had
there
been
women
in
the
house,
I
should
have
suspected
a
mere
vulgar
intrigue.
That,
however,
was
out
of
the
question.
The
man's
business
was
a
small
one,
and
there
was
nothing
in
his
house
which
could
account
for
such
elaborate
preparations,
and
such
an
expenditure
as
they
were
at.
It
must,
then,
be
something
out
of
the
house.
What
could
it
be?
I
thought
of
the
assistant's
fondness
for
photography,
and
his
trick
of
vanishing
into
the
cellar.
The
cellar!
There
was
the
end
of
this
tangled
clue.
Then
I
made
inquiries
as
to
this
mysterious
assistant
and
found
that
I
had
to
deal
with
one
of
the
coolest
and
most
daring
criminals
in
London.
He
was
doing
something
in
the
cellar--something
which
took
many
hours
a
day
for
months
on
end.
What
could
it
be,
once
more?
I
could
think
of
nothing
save
that
he
was
running
a
tunnel
to
some
other
building.
"So
far
I
had
got
when
we
went
to
visit
the
scene
of
action.
I
surprised
you
by
beating
upon
the
pavement
with
my
stick.
I
was
ascertaining
whether
the
cellar
stretched
out
in
front
or
behind.
It
was
not
in
front.
Then
I
rang
the
bell,
and,
as
I
hoped,
the
assistant
answered
it.
We
have
had
some
skirmishes,
but
we
had
never
set
eyes
upon
each
other
before.
I
hardly
looked
at
his
face.
His
knees
were
what
I
wished
to
see.
You
must
yourself
have
remarked
how
worn,
wrinkled,
and
stained
they
were.
They
spoke
of
those
hours
of
burrowing.
The
only
remaining
point
was
what
they
were
burrowing
for.
I
walked
round
the
corner,
saw
the
City
and
Suburban
Bank
abutted
on
our
friend's
premises,
and
felt
that
I
had
solved
my
problem.
When
you
drove
home
after
the
concert
I
called
upon
Scotland
Yard
and
upon
the
chairman
of
the
bank
directors,
with
the
result
that
you
have
seen."
"And
how
could
you
tell
that
they
would
make
their
attempt
to-night?"
I
asked.
"Well,
when
they
closed
their
League
offices
that
was
a
sign
that
they
cared
no
longer
about
Mr.
Jabez
Wilson's
presence--in
other
words,
that
they
had
completed
their
tunnel.
But
it
was
essential
that
they
should
use
it
soon,
as
it
might
be
discovered,
or
the
bullion
might
be
removed.
Saturday
would
suit
them
better
than
any
other
day,
as
it
would
give
them
two
days
for
their
escape.
For
all
these
reasons
I
expected
them
to
come
to-night."
"You
reasoned
it
out
beautifully,"
I
exclaimed
in
unfeigned
admiration.
"It
is
so
long
a
chain,
and
yet
every
link
rings
true."
"It
saved
me
from
ennui,"
he
answered,
yawning.
"Alas!
I
already
feel
it
closing
in
upon
me.
My
life
is
spent
in
one
long
effort
to
escape
from
the
commonplaces
of
existence.
These
little
problems
help
me
to
do
so."
"And
you
are
a
benefactor
of
the
race,"
said
I.
He
shrugged
his
shoulders.
"Well,
perhaps,
after
all,
it
is
of
some
little
use,"
he
remarked.
"'L'homme
c'est
rien--l'oeuvre
c'est
tout,'
as
Gustave
Flaubert
wrote
to
George
Sand."
ADVENTURE
III.
A
CASE
OF
IDENTITY
"My
dear
fellow,"
said
Sherlock
Holmes
as
we
sat
on
either
side
of
the
fire
in
his
lodgings
at
Baker
Street,
"life
is
infinitely
stranger
than
anything
which
the
mind
of
man
could
invent.
We
would
not
dare
to
conceive
the
things
which
are
really
mere
commonplaces
of
existence.
If
we
could
fly
out
of
that
window
hand
in
hand,
hover
over
this
great
city,
gently
remove
the
roofs,
and
peep
in
at
the
queer
things
which
are
going
on,
the
strange
coincidences,
the
plannings,
the
cross-purposes,
the
wonderful
chains
of
events,
working
through
generations,
and
leading
to
the
most
outré
results,
it
would
make
all
fiction
with
its
conventionalities
and
foreseen
conclusions
most
stale
and
unprofitable."
"And
yet
I
am
not
convinced
of
it,"
I
answered.
"The
cases
which
come
to
light
in
the
papers
are,
as
a
rule,
bald
enough,
and
vulgar
enough.
We
have
in
our
police
reports
realism
pushed
to
its
extreme
limits,
and
yet
the
result
is,
it
must
be
confessed,
neither
fascinating
nor
artistic."
"A
certain
selection
and
discretion
must
be
used
in
producing
a
realistic
effect,"
remarked
Holmes.
"This
is
wanting
in
the
police
report,
where
more
stress
is
laid,
perhaps,
upon
the
platitudes
of
the
magistrate
than
upon
the
details,
which
to
an
observer
contain
the
vital
essence
of
the
whole
matter.
Depend
upon
it,
there
is
nothing
so
unnatural
as
the
commonplace."
I
smiled
and
shook
my
head.
"I
can
quite
understand
your
thinking
so,"
I
said.
"Of
course,
in
your
position
of
unofficial
adviser
and
helper
to
everybody
who
is
absolutely
puzzled,
throughout
three
continents,
you
are
brought
in
contact
with
all
that
is
strange
and
bizarre.
But
here"--I
picked
up
the
morning
paper
from
the
ground--"let
us
put
it
to
a
practical
test.
Here
is
the
first
heading
upon
which
I
come.
'A
husband's
cruelty
to
his
wife.'
There
is
half
a
column
of
print,
but
I
know
without
reading
it
that
it
is
all
perfectly
familiar
to
me.
There
is,
of
course,
the
other
woman,
the
drink,
the
push,
the
blow,
the
bruise,
the
sympathetic
sister
or
landlady.
The
crudest
of
writers
could
invent
nothing
more
crude."
"Indeed,
your
example
is
an
unfortunate
one
for
your
argument,"
said
Holmes,
taking
the
paper
and
glancing
his
eye
down
it.
"This
is
the
Dundas
separation
case,
and,
as
it
happens,
I
was
engaged
in
clearing
up
some
small
points
in
connection
with
it.
The
husband
was
a
teetotaler,
there
was
no
other
woman,
and
the
conduct
complained
of
was
that
he
had
drifted
into
the
habit
of
winding
up
every
meal
by
taking
out
his
false
teeth
and
hurling
them
at
his
wife,
which,
you
will
allow,
is
not
an
action
likely
to
occur
to
the
imagination
of
the
average
story-teller.
Take
a
pinch
of
snuff,
Doctor,
and
acknowledge
that
I
have
scored
over
you
in
your
example."
He
held
out
his
snuffbox
of
old
gold,
with
a
great
amethyst
in
the
centre
of
the
lid.
Its
splendour
was
in
such
contrast
to
his
homely
ways
and
simple
life
that
I
could
not
help
commenting
upon
it.
"Ah,"
said
he,
"I
forgot
that
I
had
not
seen
you
for
some
weeks.
It
is
a
little
souvenir
from
the
King
of
Bohemia
in
return
for
my
assistance
in
the
case
of
the
Irene
Adler
papers."
"And
the
ring?"
I
asked,
glancing
at
a
remarkable
brilliant
which
sparkled
upon
his
finger.
"It
was
from
the
reigning
family
of
Holland,
though
the
matter
in
which
I
served
them
was
of
such
delicacy
that
I
cannot
confide
it
even
to
you,
who
have
been
good
enough
to
chronicle
one
or
two
of
my
little
problems."
"And
have
you
any
on
hand
just
now?"
I
asked
with
interest.
"Some
ten
or
twelve,
but
none
which
present
any
feature
of
interest.
They
are
important,
you
understand,
without
being
interesting.
Indeed,
I
have
found
that
it
is
usually
in
unimportant
matters
that
there
is
a
field
for
the
observation,
and
for
the
quick
analysis
of
cause
and
effect
which
gives
the
charm
to
an
investigation.
The
larger
crimes
are
apt
to
be
the
simpler,
for
the
bigger
the
crime
the
more
obvious,
as
a
rule,
is
the
motive.
In
these
cases,
save
for
one
rather
intricate
matter
which
has
been
referred
to
me
from
Marseilles,
there
is
nothing
which
presents
any
features
of
interest.
It
is
possible,
however,
that
I
may
have
something
better
before
very
many
minutes
are
over,
for
this
is
one
of
my
clients,
or
I
am
much
mistaken."
He
had
risen
from
his
chair
and
was
standing
between
the
parted
blinds
gazing
down
into
the
dull
neutral-tinted
London
street.
Looking
over
his
shoulder,
I
saw
that
on
the
pavement
opposite
there
stood
a
large
woman
with
a
heavy
fur
boa
round
her
neck,
and
a
large
curling
red
feather
in
a
broad-brimmed
hat
which
was
tilted
in
a
coquettish
Duchess
of
Devonshire
fashion
over
her
ear.
From
under
this
great
panoply
she
peeped
up
in
a
nervous,
hesitating
fashion
at
our
windows,
while
her
body
oscillated
backward
and
forward,
and
her
fingers
fidgeted
with
her
glove
buttons.
Suddenly,
with
a
plunge,
as
of
the
swimmer
who
leaves
the
bank,
she
hurried
across
the
road,
and
we
heard
the
sharp
clang
of
the
bell.
"I
have
seen
those
symptoms
before,"
said
Holmes,
throwing
his
cigarette
into
the
fire.
"Oscillation
upon
the
pavement
always
means
an
affaire
de
coeur.
She
would
like
advice,
but
is
not
sure
that
the
matter
is
not
too
delicate
for
communication.
And
yet
even
here
we
may
discriminate.
When
a
woman
has
been
seriously
wronged
by
a
man
she
no
longer
oscillates,
and
the
usual
symptom
is
a
broken
bell
wire.
Here
we
may
take
it
that
there
is
a
love
matter,
but
that
the
maiden
is
not
so
much
angry
as
perplexed,
or
grieved.
But
here
she
comes
in
person
to
resolve
our
doubts."
As
he
spoke
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door,
and
the
boy
in
buttons
entered
to
announce
Miss
Mary
Sutherland,
while
the
lady
herself
loomed
behind
his
small
black
figure
like
a
full-sailed
merchant-man
behind
a
tiny
pilot
boat.
Sherlock
Holmes
welcomed
her
with
the
easy
courtesy
for
which
he
was
remarkable,
and,
having
closed
the
door
and
bowed
her
into
an
armchair,
he
looked
her
over
in
the
minute
and
yet
abstracted
fashion
which
was
peculiar
to
him.
"Do
you
not
find,"
he
said,
"that
with
your
short
sight
it
is
a
little
trying
to
do
so
much
typewriting?"
"I
did
at
first,"
she
answered,
"but
now
I
know
where
the
letters
are
without
looking."
Then,
suddenly
realising
the
full
purport
of
his
words,
she
gave
a
violent
start
and
looked
up,
with
fear
and
astonishment
upon
her
broad,
good-humoured
face.
"You've
heard
about
me,
Mr.
Holmes,"
she
cried,
"else
how
could
you
know
all
that?"
"Never
mind,"
said
Holmes,
laughing;
"it
is
my
business
to
know
things.
Perhaps
I
have
trained
myself
to
see
what
others
overlook.
If
not,
why
should
you
come
to
consult
me?"
"I
came
to
you,
sir,
because
I
heard
of
you
from
Mrs.
Etherege,
whose
husband
you
found
so
easy
when
the
police
and
everyone
had
given
him
up
for
dead.
Oh,
Mr.
Holmes,
I
wish
you
would
do
as
much
for
me.
I'm
not
rich,
but
still
I
have
a
hundred
a
year
in
my
own
right,
besides
the
little
that
I
make
by
the
machine,
and
I
would
give
it
all
to
know
what
has
become
of
Mr.
Hosmer
Angel."
"Why
did
you
come
away
to
consult
me
in
such
a
hurry?"
asked
Sherlock
Holmes,
with
his
finger-tips
together
and
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling.
Again
a
startled
look
came
over
the
somewhat
vacuous
face
of
Miss
Mary
Sutherland.
"Yes,
I
did
bang
out
of
the
house,"
she
said,
"for
it
made
me
angry
to
see
the
easy
way
in
which
Mr.
Windibank--that
is,
my
father--took
it
all.
He
would
not
go
to
the
police,
and
he
would
not
go
to
you,
and
so
at
last,
as
he
would
do
nothing
and
kept
on
saying
that
there
was
no
harm
done,
it
made
me
mad,
and
I
just
on
with
my
things
and
came
right
away
to
you."
"Your
father,"
said
Holmes,
"your
stepfather,
surely,
since
the
name
is
different."
"Yes,
my
stepfather.
I
call
him
father,
though
it
sounds
funny,
too,
for
he
is
only
five
years
and
two
months
older
than
myself."
"And
your
mother
is
alive?"
"Oh,
yes,
mother
is
alive
and
well.
I
wasn't
best
pleased,
Mr.
Holmes,
when
she
married
again
so
soon
after
father's
death,
and
a
man
who
was
nearly
fifteen
years
younger
than
herself.
Father
was
a
plumber
in
the
Tottenham
Court
Road,
and
he
left
a
tidy
business
behind
him,
which
mother
carried
on
with
Mr.
Hardy,
the
foreman;
but
when
Mr.
Windibank
came
he
made
her
sell
the
business,
for
he
was
very
superior,
being
a
traveller
in
wines.
They
got
4700
pounds
for
the
goodwill
and
interest,
which
wasn't
near
as
much
as
father
could
have
got
if
he
had
been
alive."
I
had
expected
to
see
Sherlock
Holmes
impatient
under
this
rambling
and
inconsequential
narrative,
but,
on
the
contrary,
he
had
listened
with
the
greatest
concentration
of
attention.
"Your
own
little
income,"
he
asked,
"does
it
come
out
of
the
business?"
"Oh,
no,
sir.
It
is
quite
separate
and
was
left
me
by
my
uncle
Ned
in
Auckland.
It
is
in
New
Zealand
stock,
paying
4
1/2
per
cent.
Two
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
was
the
amount,
but
I
can
only
touch
the
interest."
"You
interest
me
extremely,"
said
Holmes.
"And
since
you
draw
so
large
a
sum
as
a
hundred
a
year,
with
what
you
earn
into
the
bargain,
you
no
doubt
travel
a
little
and
indulge
yourself
in
every
way.
I
believe
that
a
single
lady
can
get
on
very
nicely
upon
an
income
of
about
60
pounds."
"I
could
do
with
much
less
than
that,
Mr.
Holmes,
but
you
understand
that
as
long
as
I
live
at
home
I
don't
wish
to
be
a
burden
to
them,
and
so
they
have
the
use
of
the
money
just
while
I
am
staying
with
them.
Of
course,
that
is
only
just
for
the
time.
Mr.
Windibank
draws
my
interest
every
quarter
and
pays
it
over
to
mother,
and
I
find
that
I
can
do
pretty
well
with
what
I
earn
at
typewriting.
It
brings
me
twopence
a
sheet,
and
I
can
often
do
from
fifteen
to
twenty
sheets
in
a
day."
"You
have
made
your
position
very
clear
to
me,"
said
Holmes.
"This
is
my
friend,
Dr.
Watson,
before
whom
you
can
speak
as
freely
as
before
myself.
Kindly
tell
us
now
all
about
your
connection
with
Mr.
Hosmer
Angel."
A
flush
stole
over
Miss
Sutherland's
face,
and
she
picked
nervously
at
the
fringe
of
her
jacket.
"I
met
him
first
at
the
gasfitters'
ball,"
she
said.
"They
used
to
send
father
tickets
when
he
was
alive,
and
then
afterwards
they
remembered
us,
and
sent
them
to
mother.
Mr.
Windibank
did
not
wish
us
to
go.
He
never
did
wish
us
to
go
anywhere.
He
would
get
quite
mad
if
I
wanted
so
much
as
to
join
a
Sunday-school
treat.
But
this
time
I
was
set
on
going,
and
I
would
go;
for
what
right
had
he
to
prevent?
He
said
the
folk
were
not
fit
for
us
to
know,
when
all
father's
friends
were
to
be
there.
And
he
said
that
I
had
nothing
fit
to
wear,
when
I
had
my
purple
plush
that
I
had
never
so
much
as
taken
out
of
the
drawer.
At
last,
when
nothing
else
would
do,
he
went
off
to
France
upon
the
business
of
the
firm,
but
we
went,
mother
and
I,
with
Mr.
Hardy,
who
used
to
be
our
foreman,
and
it
was
there
I
met
Mr.
Hosmer
Angel."
"I
suppose,"
said
Holmes,
"that
when
Mr.
Windibank
came
back
from
France
he
was
very
annoyed
at
your
having
gone
to
the
ball."
"Oh,
well,
he
was
very
good
about
it.
He
laughed,
I
remember,
and
shrugged
his
shoulders,
and
said
there
was
no
use
denying
anything
to
a
woman,
for
she
would
have
her
way."
"I
see.
Then
at
the
gasfitters'
ball
you
met,
as
I
understand,
a
gentleman
called
Mr.
Hosmer
Angel."
"Yes,
sir.
I
met
him
that
night,
and
he
called
next
day
to
ask
if
we
had
got
home
all
safe,
and
after
that
we
met
him--that
is
to
say,
Mr.
Holmes,
I
met
him
twice
for
walks,
but
after
that
father
came
back
again,
and
Mr.
Hosmer
Angel
could
not
come
to
the
house
any
more."
"No?"
"Well,
you
know
father
didn't
like
anything
of
the
sort.
He
wouldn't
have
any
visitors
if
he
could
help
it,
and
he
used
to
say
that
a
woman
should
be
happy
in
her
own
family
circle.
But
then,
as
I
used
to
say
to
mother,
a
woman
wants
her
own
circle
to
begin
with,
and
I
had
not
got
mine
yet."
"But
how
about
Mr.
Hosmer
Angel?
Did
he
make
no
attempt
to
see
you?"
"Well,
father
was
going
off
to
France
again
in
a
week,
and
Hosmer
wrote
and
said
that
it
would
be
safer
and
better
not
to
see
each
other
until
he
had
gone.
We
could
write
in
the
meantime,
and
he
used
to
write
every
day.
I
took
the
letters
in
in
the
morning,
so
there
was
no
need
for
father
to
know."
"Were
you
engaged
to
the
gentleman
at
this
time?"
"Oh,
yes,
Mr.
Holmes.
We
were
engaged
after
the
first
walk
that
we
took.
Hosmer--Mr.
Angel--was
a
cashier
in
an
office
in
Leadenhall
Street--and--"
"What
office?"
"That's
the
worst
of
it,
Mr.
Holmes,
I
don't
know."
"Where
did
he
live,
then?"
"He
slept
on
the
premises."
"And
you
don't
know
his
address?"
"No--except
that
it
was
Leadenhall
Street."
"Where
did
you
address
your
letters,
then?"
"To
the
Leadenhall
Street
Post
Office,
to
be
left
till
called
for.
He
said
that
if
they
were
sent
to
the
office
he
would
be
chaffed
by
all
the
other
clerks
about
having
letters
from
a
lady,
so
I
offered
to
typewrite
them,
like
he
did
his,
but
he
wouldn't
have
that,
for
he
said
that
when
I
wrote
them
they
seemed
to
come
from
me,
but
when
they
were
typewritten
he
always
felt
that
the
machine
had
come
between
us.
That
will
just
show
you
how
fond
he
was
of
me,
Mr.
Holmes,
and
the
little
things
that
he
would
think
of."
"It
was
most
suggestive,"
said
Holmes.
"It
has
long
been
an
axiom
of
mine
that
the
little
things
are
infinitely
the
most
important.
Can
you
remember
any
other
little
things
about
Mr.
Hosmer
Angel?"
"He
was
a
very
shy
man,
Mr.
Holmes.
He
would
rather
walk
with
me
in
the
evening
than
in
the
daylight,
for
he
said
that
he
hated
to
be
conspicuous.
Very
retiring
and
gentlemanly
he
was.
Even
his
voice
was
gentle.
He'd
had
the
quinsy
and
swollen
glands
when
he
was
young,
he
told
me,
and
it
had
left
him
with
a
weak
throat,
and
a
hesitating,
whispering
fashion
of
speech.
He
was
always
well
dressed,
very
neat
and
plain,
but
his
eyes
were
weak,
just
as
mine
are,
and
he
wore
tinted
glasses
against
the
glare."
"Well,
and
what
happened
when
Mr.
Windibank,
your
stepfather,
returned
to
France?"
"Mr.
Hosmer
Angel
came
to
the
house
again
and
proposed
that
we
should
marry
before
father
came
back.
He
was
in
dreadful
earnest
and
made
me
swear,
with
my
hands
on
the
Testament,
that
whatever
happened
I
would
always
be
true
to
him.
Mother
said
he
was
quite
right
to
make
me
swear,
and
that
it
was
a
sign
of
his
passion.
Mother
was
all
in
his
favour
from
the
first
and
was
even
fonder
of
him
than
I
was.
Then,
when
they
talked
of
marrying
within
the
week,
I
began
to
ask
about
father;
but
they
both
said
never
to
mind
about
father,
but
just
to
tell
him
afterwards,
and
mother
said
she
would
make
it
all
right
with
him.
I
didn't
quite
like
that,
Mr.
Holmes.
It
seemed
funny
that
I
should
ask
his
leave,
as
he
was
only
a
few
years
older
than
me;
but
I
didn't
want
to
do
anything
on
the
sly,
so
I
wrote
to
father
at
Bordeaux,
where
the
company
has
its
French
offices,
but
the
letter
came
back
to
me
on
the
very
morning
of
the
wedding."
"It
missed
him,
then?"
"Yes,
sir;
for
he
had
started
to
England
just
before
it
arrived."
"Ha!
that
was
unfortunate.
Your
wedding
was
arranged,
then,
for
the
Friday.
Was
it
to
be
in
church?"
"Yes,
sir,
but
very
quietly.
It
was
to
be
at
St.
Saviour's,
near
King's
Cross,
and
we
were
to
have
breakfast
afterwards
at
the
St.
Pancras
Hotel.
Hosmer
came
for
us
in
a
hansom,
but
as
there
were
two
of
us
he
put
us
both
into
it
and
stepped
himself
into
a
four-wheeler,
which
happened
to
be
the
only
other
cab
in
the
street.
We
got
to
the
church
first,
and
when
the
four-wheeler
drove
up
we
waited
for
him
to
step
out,
but
he
never
did,
and
when
the
cabman
got
down
from
the
box
and
looked
there
was
no
one
there!
The
cabman
said
that
he
could
not
imagine
what
had
become
of
him,
for
he
had
seen
him
get
in
with
his
own
eyes.
That
was
last
Friday,
Mr.
Holmes,
and
I
have
never
seen
or
heard
anything
since
then
to
throw
any
light
upon
what
became
of
him."
"It
seems
to
me
that
you
have
been
very
shamefully
treated,"
said
Holmes.
"Oh,
no,
sir!
He
was
too
good
and
kind
to
leave
me
so.
Why,
all
the
morning
he
was
saying
to
me
that,
whatever
happened,
I
was
to
be
true;
and
that
even
if
something
quite
unforeseen
occurred
to
separate
us,
I
was
always
to
remember
that
I
was
pledged
to
him,
and
that
he
would
claim
his
pledge
sooner
or
later.
It
seemed
strange
talk
for
a
wedding-morning,
but
what
has
happened
since
gives
a
meaning
to
it."
"Most
certainly
it
does.
Your
own
opinion
is,
then,
that
some
unforeseen
catastrophe
has
occurred
to
him?"
"Yes,
sir.
I
believe
that
he
foresaw
some
danger,
or
else
he
would
not
have
talked
so.
And
then
I
think
that
what
he
foresaw
happened."
"But
you
have
no
notion
as
to
what
it
could
have
been?"
"None."
"One
more
question.
How
did
your
mother
take
the
matter?"
"She
was
angry,
and
said
that
I
was
never
to
speak
of
the
matter
again."
"And
your
father?
Did
you
tell
him?"
"Yes;
and
he
seemed
to
think,
with
me,
that
something
had
happened,
and
that
I
should
hear
of
Hosmer
again.
As
he
said,
what
interest
could
anyone
have
in
bringing
me
to
the
doors
of
the
church,
and
then
leaving
me?
Now,
if
he
had
borrowed
my
money,
or
if
he
had
married
me
and
got
my
money
settled
on
him,
there
might
be
some
reason,
but
Hosmer
was
very
independent
about
money
and
never
would
look
at
a
shilling
of
mine.
And
yet,
what
could
have
happened?
And
why
could
he
not
write?
Oh,
it
drives
me
half-mad
to
think
of
it,
and
I
can't
sleep
a
wink
at
night."
She
pulled
a
little
handkerchief
out
of
her
muff
and
began
to
sob
heavily
into
it.
"I
shall
glance
into
the
case
for
you,"
said
Holmes,
rising,
"and
I
have
no
doubt
that
we
shall
reach
some
definite
result.
Let
the
weight
of
the
matter
rest
upon
me
now,
and
do
not
let
your
mind
dwell
upon
it
further.
Above
all,
try
to
let
Mr.
Hosmer
Angel
vanish
from
your
memory,
as
he
has
done
from
your
life."
"Then
you
don't
think
I'll
see
him
again?"
"I
fear
not."
"Then
what
has
happened
to
him?"
"You
will
leave
that
question
in
my
hands.
I
should
like
an
accurate
description
of
him
and
any
letters
of
his
which
you
can
spare."
"I
advertised
for
him
in
last
Saturday's
Chronicle,"
said
she.
"Here
is
the
slip
and
here
are
four
letters
from
him."
"Thank
you.
And
your
address?"
"No.
31
Lyon
Place,
Camberwell."
"Mr.
Angel's
address
you
never
had,
I
understand.
Where
is
your
father's
place
of
business?"
"He
travels
for
Westhouse
&
Marbank,
the
great
claret
importers
of
Fenchurch
Street."
"Thank
you.
You
have
made
your
statement
very
clearly.
You
will
leave
the
papers
here,
and
remember
the
advice
which
I
have
given
you.
Let
the
whole
incident
be
a
sealed
book,
and
do
not
allow
it
to
affect
your
life."
"You
are
very
kind,
Mr.
Holmes,
but
I
cannot
do
that.
I
shall
be
true
to
Hosmer.
He
shall
find
me
ready
when
he
comes
back."
For
all
the
preposterous
hat
and
the
vacuous
face,
there
was
something
noble
in
the
simple
faith
of
our
visitor
which
compelled
our
respect.
She
laid
her
little
bundle
of
papers
upon
the
table
and
went
her
way,
with
a
promise
to
come
again
whenever
she
might
be
summoned.
Sherlock
Holmes
sat
silent
for
a
few
minutes
with
his
fingertips
still
pressed
together,
his
legs
stretched
out
in
front
of
him,
and
his
gaze
directed
upward
to
the
ceiling.
Then
he
took
down
from
the
rack
the
old
and
oily
clay
pipe,
which
was
to
him
as
a
counsellor,
and,
having
lit
it,
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair,
with
the
thick
blue
cloud-wreaths
spinning
up
from
him,
and
a
look
of
infinite
languor
in
his
face.
"Quite
an
interesting
study,
that
maiden,"
he
observed.
"I
found
her
more
interesting
than
her
little
problem,
which,
by
the
way,
is
rather
a
trite
one.
You
will
find
parallel
cases,
if
you
consult
my
index,
in
Andover
in
'77,
and
there
was
something
of
the
sort
at
The
Hague
last
year.
Old
as
is
the
idea,
however,
there
were
one
or
two
details
which
were
new
to
me.
But
the
maiden
herself
was
most
instructive."
"You
appeared
to
read
a
good
deal
upon
her
which
was
quite
invisible
to
me,"
I
remarked.
"Not
invisible
but
unnoticed,
Watson.
You
did
not
know
where
to
look,
and
so
you
missed
all
that
was
important.
I
can
never
bring
you
to
realise
the
importance
of
sleeves,
the
suggestiveness
of
thumb-nails,
or
the
great
issues
that
may
hang
from
a
boot-lace.
Now,
what
did
you
gather
from
that
woman's
appearance?
Describe
it."
"Well,
she
had
a
slate-coloured,
broad-brimmed
straw
hat,
with
a
feather
of
a
brickish
red.
Her
jacket
was
black,
with
black
beads
sewn
upon
it,
and
a
fringe
of
little
black
jet
ornaments.
Her
dress
was
brown,
rather
darker
than
coffee
colour,
with
a
little
purple
plush
at
the
neck
and
sleeves.
Her
gloves
were
greyish
and
were
worn
through
at
the
right
forefinger.
Her
boots
I
didn't
observe.
She
had
small
round,
hanging
gold
earrings,
and
a
general
air
of
being
fairly
well-to-do
in
a
vulgar,
comfortable,
easy-going
way."
Sherlock
Holmes
clapped
his
hands
softly
together
and
chuckled.
"'Pon
my
word,
Watson,
you
are
coming
along
wonderfully.
You
have
really
done
very
well
indeed.
It
is
true
that
you
have
missed
everything
of
importance,
but
you
have
hit
upon
the
method,
and
you
have
a
quick
eye
for
colour.
Never
trust
to
general
impressions,
my
boy,
but
concentrate
yourself
upon
details.
My
first
glance
is
always
at
a
woman's
sleeve.
In
a
man
it
is
perhaps
better
first
to
take
the
knee
of
the
trouser.
As
you
observe,
this
woman
had
plush
upon
her
sleeves,
which
is
a
most
useful
material
for
showing
traces.
The
double
line
a
little
above
the
wrist,
where
the
typewritist
presses
against
the
table,
was
beautifully
defined.
The
sewing-machine,
of
the
hand
type,
leaves
a
similar
mark,
but
only
on
the
left
arm,
and
on
the
side
of
it
farthest
from
the
thumb,
instead
of
being
right
across
the
broadest
part,
as
this
was.
I
then
glanced
at
her
face,
and,
observing
the
dint
of
a
pince-nez
at
either
side
of
her
nose,
I
ventured
a
remark
upon
short
sight
and
typewriting,
which
seemed
to
surprise
her."
"It
surprised
me."
"But,
surely,
it
was
obvious.
I
was
then
much
surprised
and
interested
on
glancing
down
to
observe
that,
though
the
boots
which
she
was
wearing
were
not
unlike
each
other,
they
were
really
odd
ones;
the
one
having
a
slightly
decorated
toe-cap,
and
the
other
a
plain
one.
One
was
buttoned
only
in
the
two
lower
buttons
out
of
five,
and
the
other
at
the
first,
third,
and
fifth.
Now,
when
you
see
that
a
young
lady,
otherwise
neatly
dressed,
has
come
away
from
home
with
odd
boots,
half-buttoned,
it
is
no
great
deduction
to
say
that
she
came
away
in
a
hurry."
"And
what
else?"
I
asked,
keenly
interested,
as
I
always
was,
by
my
friend's
incisive
reasoning.
"I
noted,
in
passing,
that
she
had
written
a
note
before
leaving
home
but
after
being
fully
dressed.
You
observed
that
her
right
glove
was
torn
at
the
forefinger,
but
you
did
not
apparently
see
that
both
glove
and
finger
were
stained
with
violet
ink.
She
had
written
in
a
hurry
and
dipped
her
pen
too
deep.
It
must
have
been
this
morning,
or
the
mark
would
not
remain
clear
upon
the
finger.
All
this
is
amusing,
though
rather
elementary,
but
I
must
go
back
to
business,
Watson.
Would
you
mind
reading
me
the
advertised
description
of
Mr.
Hosmer
Angel?"
I
held
the
little
printed
slip
to
the
light.
"Missing,"
it
said,
"on
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth,
a
gentleman
named
Hosmer
Angel.
About
five
ft.
seven
in.
in
height;
strongly
built,
sallow
complexion,
black
hair,
a
little
bald
in
the
centre,
bushy,
black
side-whiskers
and
moustache;
tinted
glasses,
slight
infirmity
of
speech.
Was
dressed,
when
last
seen,
in
black
frock-coat
faced
with
silk,
black
waistcoat,
gold
Albert
chain,
and
grey
Harris
tweed
trousers,
with
brown
gaiters
over
elastic-sided
boots.
Known
to
have
been
employed
in
an
office
in
Leadenhall
Street.
Anybody
bringing--"
"That
will
do,"
said
Holmes.
"As
to
the
letters,"
he
continued,
glancing
over
them,
"they
are
very
commonplace.
Absolutely
no
clue
in
them
to
Mr.
Angel,
save
that
he
quotes
Balzac
once.
There
is
one
remarkable
point,
however,
which
will
no
doubt
strike
you."
"They
are
typewritten,"
I
remarked.
"Not
only
that,
but
the
signature
is
typewritten.
Look
at
the
neat
little
'Hosmer
Angel'
at
the
bottom.
There
is
a
date,
you
see,
but
no
superscription
except
Leadenhall
Street,
which
is
rather
vague.
The
point
about
the
signature
is
very
suggestive--in
fact,
we
may
call
it
conclusive."
"Of
what?"
"My
dear
fellow,
is
it
possible
you
do
not
see
how
strongly
it
bears
upon
the
case?"
"I
cannot
say
that
I
do
unless
it
were
that
he
wished
to
be
able
to
deny
his
signature
if
an
action
for
breach
of
promise
were
instituted."
"No,
that
was
not
the
point.
However,
I
shall
write
two
letters,
which
should
settle
the
matter.
One
is
to
a
firm
in
the
City,
the
other
is
to
the
young
lady's
stepfather,
Mr.
Windibank,
asking
him
whether
he
could
meet
us
here
at
six
o'clock
tomorrow
evening.
It
is
just
as
well
that
we
should
do
business
with
the
male
relatives.
And
now,
Doctor,
we
can
do
nothing
until
the
answers
to
those
letters
come,
so
we
may
put
our
little
problem
upon
the
shelf
for
the
interim."
I
had
had
so
many
reasons
to
believe
in
my
friend's
subtle
powers
of
reasoning
and
extraordinary
energy
in
action
that
I
felt
that
he
must
have
some
solid
grounds
for
the
assured
and
easy
demeanour
with
which
he
treated
the
singular
mystery
which
he
had
been
called
upon
to
fathom.
Once
only
had
I
known
him
to
fail,
in
the
case
of
the
King
of
Bohemia
and
of
the
Irene
Adler
photograph;
but
when
I
looked
back
to
the
weird
business
of
the
Sign
of
Four,
and
the
extraordinary
circumstances
connected
with
the
Study
in
Scarlet,
I
felt
that
it
would
be
a
strange
tangle
indeed
which
he
could
not
unravel.
I
left
him
then,
still
puffing
at
his
black
clay
pipe,
with
the
conviction
that
when
I
came
again
on
the
next
evening
I
would
find
that
he
held
in
his
hands
all
the
clues
which
would
lead
up
to
the
identity
of
the
disappearing
bridegroom
of
Miss
Mary
Sutherland.
A
professional
case
of
great
gravity
was
engaging
my
own
attention
at
the
time,
and
the
whole
of
next
day
I
was
busy
at
the
bedside
of
the
sufferer.
It
was
not
until
close
upon
six
o'clock
that
I
found
myself
free
and
was
able
to
spring
into
a
hansom
and
drive
to
Baker
Street,
half
afraid
that
I
might
be
too
late
to
assist
at
the
dénouement
of
the
little
mystery.
I
found
Sherlock
Holmes
alone,
however,
half
asleep,
with
his
long,
thin
form
curled
up
in
the
recesses
of
his
armchair.
A
formidable
array
of
bottles
and
test-tubes,
with
the
pungent
cleanly
smell
of
hydrochloric
acid,
told
me
that
he
had
spent
his
day
in
the
chemical
work
which
was
so
dear
to
him.
"Well,
have
you
solved
it?"
I
asked
as
I
entered.
"Yes.
It
was
the
bisulphate
of
baryta."
"No,
no,
the
mystery!"
I
cried.
"Oh,
that!
I
thought
of
the
salt
that
I
have
been
working
upon.
There
was
never
any
mystery
in
the
matter,
though,
as
I
said
yesterday,
some
of
the
details
are
of
interest.
The
only
drawback
is
that
there
is
no
law,
I
fear,
that
can
touch
the
scoundrel."
"Who
was
he,
then,
and
what
was
his
object
in
deserting
Miss
Sutherland?"
The
question
was
hardly
out
of
my
mouth,
and
Holmes
had
not
yet
opened
his
lips
to
reply,
when
we
heard
a
heavy
footfall
in
the
passage
and
a
tap
at
the
door.
"This
is
the
girl's
stepfather,
Mr.
James
Windibank,"
said
Holmes.
"He
has
written
to
me
to
say
that
he
would
be
here
at
six.
Come
in!"
The
man
who
entered
was
a
sturdy,
middle-sized
fellow,
some
thirty
years
of
age,
clean-shaven,
and
sallow-skinned,
with
a
bland,
insinuating
manner,
and
a
pair
of
wonderfully
sharp
and
penetrating
grey
eyes.
He
shot
a
questioning
glance
at
each
of
us,
placed
his
shiny
top-hat
upon
the
sideboard,
and
with
a
slight
bow
sidled
down
into
the
nearest
chair.
"Good-evening,
Mr.
James
Windibank,"
said
Holmes.
"I
think
that
this
typewritten
letter
is
from
you,
in
which
you
made
an
appointment
with
me
for
six
o'clock?"
"Yes,
sir.
I
am
afraid
that
I
am
a
little
late,
but
I
am
not
quite
my
own
master,
you
know.
I
am
sorry
that
Miss
Sutherland
has
troubled
you
about
this
little
matter,
for
I
think
it
is
far
better
not
to
wash
linen
of
the
sort
in
public.
It
was
quite
against
my
wishes
that
she
came,
but
she
is
a
very
excitable,
impulsive
girl,
as
you
may
have
noticed,
and
she
is
not
easily
controlled
when
she
has
made
up
her
mind
on
a
point.
Of
course,
I
did
not
mind
you
so
much,
as
you
are
not
connected
with
the
official
police,
but
it
is
not
pleasant
to
have
a
family
misfortune
like
this
noised
abroad.
Besides,
it
is
a
useless
expense,
for
how
could
you
possibly
find
this
Hosmer
Angel?"
"On
the
contrary,"
said
Holmes
quietly;
"I
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
I
will
succeed
in
discovering
Mr.
Hosmer
Angel."
Mr.
Windibank
gave
a
violent
start
and
dropped
his
gloves.
"I
am
delighted
to
hear
it,"
he
said.
"It
is
a
curious
thing,"
remarked
Holmes,
"that
a
typewriter
has
really
quite
as
much
individuality
as
a
man's
handwriting.
Unless
they
are
quite
new,
no
two
of
them
write
exactly
alike.
Some
letters
get
more
worn
than
others,
and
some
wear
only
on
one
side.
Now,
you
remark
in
this
note
of
yours,
Mr.
Windibank,
that
in
every
case
there
is
some
little
slurring
over
of
the
'e,'
and
a
slight
defect
in
the
tail
of
the
'r.'
There
are
fourteen
other
characteristics,
but
those
are
the
more
obvious."
"We
do
all
our
correspondence
with
this
machine
at
the
office,
and
no
doubt
it
is
a
little
worn,"
our
visitor
answered,
glancing
keenly
at
Holmes
with
his
bright
little
eyes.
"And
now
I
will
show
you
what
is
really
a
very
interesting
study,
Mr.
Windibank,"
Holmes
continued.
"I
think
of
writing
another
little
monograph
some
of
these
days
on
the
typewriter
and
its
relation
to
crime.
It
is
a
subject
to
which
I
have
devoted
some
little
attention.
I
have
here
four
letters
which
purport
to
come
from
the
missing
man.
They
are
all
typewritten.
In
each
case,
not
only
are
the
'e's'
slurred
and
the
'r's'
tailless,
but
you
will
observe,
if
you
care
to
use
my
magnifying
lens,
that
the
fourteen
other
characteristics
to
which
I
have
alluded
are
there
as
well."
Mr.
Windibank
sprang
out
of
his
chair
and
picked
up
his
hat.
"I
cannot
waste
time
over
this
sort
of
fantastic
talk,
Mr.
Holmes,"
he
said.
"If
you
can
catch
the
man,
catch
him,
and
let
me
know
when
you
have
done
it."
"Certainly,"
said
Holmes,
stepping
over
and
turning
the
key
in
the
door.
"I
let
you
know,
then,
that
I
have
caught
him!"
"What!
where?"
shouted
Mr.
Windibank,
turning
white
to
his
lips
and
glancing
about
him
like
a
rat
in
a
trap.
"Oh,
it
won't
do--really
it
won't,"
said
Holmes
suavely.
"There
is
no
possible
getting
out
of
it,
Mr.
Windibank.
It
is
quite
too
transparent,
and
it
was
a
very
bad
compliment
when
you
said
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
solve
so
simple
a
question.
That's
right!
Sit
down
and
let
us
talk
it
over."
Our
visitor
collapsed
into
a
chair,
with
a
ghastly
face
and
a
glitter
of
moisture
on
his
brow.
"It--it's
not
actionable,"
he
stammered.
"I
am
very
much
afraid
that
it
is
not.
But
between
ourselves,
Windibank,
it
was
as
cruel
and
selfish
and
heartless
a
trick
in
a
petty
way
as
ever
came
before
me.
Now,
let
me
just
run
over
the
course
of
events,
and
you
will
contradict
me
if
I
go
wrong."
The
man
sat
huddled
up
in
his
chair,
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
breast,
like
one
who
is
utterly
crushed.
Holmes
stuck
his
feet
up
on
the
corner
of
the
mantelpiece
and,
leaning
back
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets,
began
talking,
rather
to
himself,
as
it
seemed,
than
to
us.
"The
man
married
a
woman
very
much
older
than
himself
for
her
money,"
said
he,
"and
he
enjoyed
the
use
of
the
money
of
the
daughter
as
long
as
she
lived
with
them.
It
was
a
considerable
sum,
for
people
in
their
position,
and
the
loss
of
it
would
have
made
a
serious
difference.
It
was
worth
an
effort
to
preserve
it.
The
daughter
was
of
a
good,
amiable
disposition,
but
affectionate
and
warm-hearted
in
her
ways,
so
that
it
was
evident
that
with
her
fair
personal
advantages,
and
her
little
income,
she
would
not
be
allowed
to
remain
single
long.
Now
her
marriage
would
mean,
of
course,
the
loss
of
a
hundred
a
year,
so
what
does
her
stepfather
do
to
prevent
it?
He
takes
the
obvious
course
of
keeping
her
at
home
and
forbidding
her
to
seek
the
company
of
people
of
her
own
age.
But
soon
he
found
that
that
would
not
answer
forever.
She
became
restive,
insisted
upon
her
rights,
and
finally
announced
her
positive
intention
of
going
to
a
certain
ball.
What
does
her
clever
stepfather
do
then?
He
conceives
an
idea
more
creditable
to
his
head
than
to
his
heart.
With
the
connivance
and
assistance
of
his
wife
he
disguised
himself,
covered
those
keen
eyes
with
tinted
glasses,
masked
the
face
with
a
moustache
and
a
pair
of
bushy
whiskers,
sunk
that
clear
voice
into
an
insinuating
whisper,
and
doubly
secure
on
account
of
the
girl's
short
sight,
he
appears
as
Mr.
Hosmer
Angel,
and
keeps
off
other
lovers
by
making
love
himself."
"It
was
only
a
joke
at
first,"
groaned
our
visitor.
"We
never
thought
that
she
would
have
been
so
carried
away."
"Very
likely
not.
However
that
may
be,
the
young
lady
was
very
decidedly
carried
away,
and,
having
quite
made
up
her
mind
that
her
stepfather
was
in
France,
the
suspicion
of
treachery
never
for
an
instant
entered
her
mind.
She
was
flattered
by
the
gentleman's
attentions,
and
the
effect
was
increased
by
the
loudly
expressed
admiration
of
her
mother.
Then
Mr.
Angel
began
to
call,
for
it
was
obvious
that
the
matter
should
be
pushed
as
far
as
it
would
go
if
a
real
effect
were
to
be
produced.
There
were
meetings,
and
an
engagement,
which
would
finally
secure
the
girl's
affections
from
turning
towards
anyone
else.
But
the
deception
could
not
be
kept
up
forever.
These
pretended
journeys
to
France
were
rather
cumbrous.
The
thing
to
do
was
clearly
to
bring
the
business
to
an
end
in
such
a
dramatic
manner
that
it
would
leave
a
permanent
impression
upon
the
young
lady's
mind
and
prevent
her
from
looking
upon
any
other
suitor
for
some
time
to
come.
Hence
those
vows
of
fidelity
exacted
upon
a
Testament,
and
hence
also
the
allusions
to
a
possibility
of
something
happening
on
the
very
morning
of
the
wedding.
James
Windibank
wished
Miss
Sutherland
to
be
so
bound
to
Hosmer
Angel,
and
so
uncertain
as
to
his
fate,
that
for
ten
years
to
come,
at
any
rate,
she
would
not
listen
to
another
man.
As
far
as
the
church
door
he
brought
her,
and
then,
as
he
could
go
no
farther,
he
conveniently
vanished
away
by
the
old
trick
of
stepping
in
at
one
door
of
a
four-wheeler
and
out
at
the
other.
I
think
that
was
the
chain
of
events,
Mr.
Windibank!"
Our
visitor
had
recovered
something
of
his
assurance
while
Holmes
had
been
talking,
and
he
rose
from
his
chair
now
with
a
cold
sneer
upon
his
pale
face.
"It
may
be
so,
or
it
may
not,
Mr.
Holmes,"
said
he,
"but
if
you
are
so
very
sharp
you
ought
to
be
sharp
enough
to
know
that
it
is
you
who
are
breaking
the
law
now,
and
not
me.
I
have
done
nothing
actionable
from
the
first,
but
as
long
as
you
keep
that
door
locked
you
lay
yourself
open
to
an
action
for
assault
and
illegal
constraint."
"The
law
cannot,
as
you
say,
touch
you,"
said
Holmes,
unlocking
and
throwing
open
the
door,
"yet
there
never
was
a
man
who
deserved
punishment
more.
If
the
young
lady
has
a
brother
or
a
friend,
he
ought
to
lay
a
whip
across
your
shoulders.
By
Jove!"
he
continued,
flushing
up
at
the
sight
of
the
bitter
sneer
upon
the
man's
face,
"it
is
not
part
of
my
duties
to
my
client,
but
here's
a
hunting
crop
handy,
and
I
think
I
shall
just
treat
myself
to--"
He
took
two
swift
steps
to
the
whip,
but
before
he
could
grasp
it
there
was
a
wild
clatter
of
steps
upon
the
stairs,
the
heavy
hall
door
banged,
and
from
the
window
we
could
see
Mr.
James
Windibank
running
at
the
top
of
his
speed
down
the
road.
"There's
a
cold-blooded
scoundrel!"
said
Holmes,
laughing,
as
he
threw
himself
down
into
his
chair
once
more.
"That
fellow
will
rise
from
crime
to
crime
until
he
does
something
very
bad,
and
ends
on
a
gallows.
The
case
has,
in
some
respects,
been
not
entirely
devoid
of
interest."
"I
cannot
now
entirely
see
all
the
steps
of
your
reasoning,"
I
remarked.
"Well,
of
course
it
was
obvious
from
the
first
that
this
Mr.
Hosmer
Angel
must
have
some
strong
object
for
his
curious
conduct,
and
it
was
equally
clear
that
the
only
man
who
really
profited
by
the
incident,
as
far
as
we
could
see,
was
the
stepfather.
Then
the
fact
that
the
two
men
were
never
together,
but
that
the
one
always
appeared
when
the
other
was
away,
was
suggestive.
So
were
the
tinted
spectacles
and
the
curious
voice,
which
both
hinted
at
a
disguise,
as
did
the
bushy
whiskers.
My
suspicions
were
all
confirmed
by
his
peculiar
action
in
typewriting
his
signature,
which,
of
course,
inferred
that
his
handwriting
was
so
familiar
to
her
that
she
would
recognise
even
the
smallest
sample
of
it.
You
see
all
these
isolated
facts,
together
with
many
minor
ones,
all
pointed
in
the
same
direction."
"And
how
did
you
verify
them?"
"Having
once
spotted
my
man,
it
was
easy
to
get
corroboration.
I
knew
the
firm
for
which
this
man
worked.
Having
taken
the
printed
description.
I
eliminated
everything
from
it
which
could
be
the
result
of
a
disguise--the
whiskers,
the
glasses,
the
voice,
and
I
sent
it
to
the
firm,
with
a
request
that
they
would
inform
me
whether
it
answered
to
the
description
of
any
of
their
travellers.
I
had
already
noticed
the
peculiarities
of
the
typewriter,
and
I
wrote
to
the
man
himself
at
his
business
address
asking
him
if
he
would
come
here.
As
I
expected,
his
reply
was
typewritten
and
revealed
the
same
trivial
but
characteristic
defects.
The
same
post
brought
me
a
letter
from
Westhouse
&
Marbank,
of
Fenchurch
Street,
to
say
that
the
description
tallied
in
every
respect
with
that
of
their
employé,
James
Windibank.
Voilà
tout!"
"And
Miss
Sutherland?"
"If
I
tell
her
she
will
not
believe
me.
You
may
remember
the
old
Persian
saying,
'There
is
danger
for
him
who
taketh
the
tiger
cub,
and
danger
also
for
whoso
snatches
a
delusion
from
a
woman.'
There
is
as
much
sense
in
Hafiz
as
in
Horace,
and
as
much
knowledge
of
the
world."
ADVENTURE
IV.
THE
BOSCOMBE
VALLEY
MYSTERY
We
were
seated
at
breakfast
one
morning,
my
wife
and
I,
when
the
maid
brought
in
a
telegram.
It
was
from
Sherlock
Holmes
and
ran
in
this
way:
"Have
you
a
couple
of
days
to
spare?
Have
just
been
wired
for
from
the
west
of
England
in
connection
with
Boscombe
Valley
tragedy.
Shall
be
glad
if
you
will
come
with
me.
Air
and
scenery
perfect.
Leave
Paddington
by
the
11:15."
"What
do
you
say,
dear?"
said
my
wife,
looking
across
at
me.
"Will
you
go?"
"I
really
don't
know
what
to
say.
I
have
a
fairly
long
list
at
present."
"Oh,
Anstruther
would
do
your
work
for
you.
You
have
been
looking
a
little
pale
lately.
I
think
that
the
change
would
do
you
good,
and
you
are
always
so
interested
in
Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes'
cases."
"I
should
be
ungrateful
if
I
were
not,
seeing
what
I
gained
through
one
of
them,"
I
answered.
"But
if
I
am
to
go,
I
must
pack
at
once,
for
I
have
only
half
an
hour."
My
experience
of
camp
life
in
Afghanistan
had
at
least
had
the
effect
of
making
me
a
prompt
and
ready
traveller.
My
wants
were
few
and
simple,
so
that
in
less
than
the
time
stated
I
was
in
a
cab
with
my
valise,
rattling
away
to
Paddington
Station.
Sherlock
Holmes
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
platform,
his
tall,
gaunt
figure
made
even
gaunter
and
taller
by
his
long
grey
travelling-cloak
and
close-fitting
cloth
cap.
"It
is
really
very
good
of
you
to
come,
Watson,"
said
he.
"It
makes
a
considerable
difference
to
me,
having
someone
with
me
on
whom
I
can
thoroughly
rely.
Local
aid
is
always
either
worthless
or
else
biassed.
If
you
will
keep
the
two
corner
seats
I
shall
get
the
tickets."
We
had
the
carriage
to
ourselves
save
for
an
immense
litter
of
papers
which
Holmes
had
brought
with
him.
Among
these
he
rummaged
and
read,
with
intervals
of
note-taking
and
of
meditation,
until
we
were
past
Reading.
Then
he
suddenly
rolled
them
all
into
a
gigantic
ball
and
tossed
them
up
onto
the
rack.
"Have
you
heard
anything
of
the
case?"
he
asked.
"Not
a
word.
I
have
not
seen
a
paper
for
some
days."
"The
London
press
has
not
had
very
full
accounts.
I
have
just
been
looking
through
all
the
recent
papers
in
order
to
master
the
particulars.
It
seems,
from
what
I
gather,
to
be
one
of
those
simple
cases
which
are
so
extremely
difficult."
"That
sounds
a
little
paradoxical."
"But
it
is
profoundly
true.
Singularity
is
almost
invariably
a
clue.
The
more
featureless
and
commonplace
a
crime
is,
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
bring
it
home.
In
this
case,
however,
they
have
established
a
very
serious
case
against
the
son
of
the
murdered
man."
"It
is
a
murder,
then?"
"Well,
it
is
conjectured
to
be
so.
I
shall
take
nothing
for
granted
until
I
have
the
opportunity
of
looking
personally
into
it.
I
will
explain
the
state
of
things
to
you,
as
far
as
I
have
been
able
to
understand
it,
in
a
very
few
words.
"Boscombe
Valley
is
a
country
district
not
very
far
from
Ross,
in
Herefordshire.
The
largest
landed
proprietor
in
that
part
is
a
Mr.
John
Turner,
who
made
his
money
in
Australia
and
returned
some
years
ago
to
the
old
country.
One
of
the
farms
which
he
held,
that
of
Hatherley,
was
let
to
Mr.
Charles
McCarthy,
who
was
also
an
ex-Australian.
The
men
had
known
each
other
in
the
colonies,
so
that
it
was
not
unnatural
that
when
they
came
to
settle
down
they
should
do
so
as
near
each
other
as
possible.
Turner
was
apparently
the
richer
man,
so
McCarthy
became
his
tenant
but
still
remained,
it
seems,
upon
terms
of
perfect
equality,
as
they
were
frequently
together.
McCarthy
had
one
son,
a
lad
of
eighteen,
and
Turner
had
an
only
daughter
of
the
same
age,
but
neither
of
them
had
wives
living.
They
appear
to
have
avoided
the
society
of
the
neighbouring
English
families
and
to
have
led
retired
lives,
though
both
the
McCarthys
were
fond
of
sport
and
were
frequently
seen
at
the
race-meetings
of
the
neighbourhood.
McCarthy
kept
two
servants--a
man
and
a
girl.
Turner
had
a
considerable
household,
some
half-dozen
at
the
least.
That
is
as
much
as
I
have
been
able
to
gather
about
the
families.
Now
for
the
facts.
"On
June
3rd,
that
is,
on
Monday
last,
McCarthy
left
his
house
at
Hatherley
about
three
in
the
afternoon
and
walked
down
to
the
Boscombe
Pool,
which
is
a
small
lake
formed
by
the
spreading
out
of
the
stream
which
runs
down
the
Boscombe
Valley.
He
had
been
out
with
his
serving-man
in
the
morning
at
Ross,
and
he
had
told
the
man
that
he
must
hurry,
as
he
had
an
appointment
of
importance
to
keep
at
three.
From
that
appointment
he
never
came
back
alive.
"From
Hatherley
Farm-house
to
the
Boscombe
Pool
is
a
quarter
of
a
mile,
and
two
people
saw
him
as
he
passed
over
this
ground.
One
was
an
old
woman,
whose
name
is
not
mentioned,
and
the
other
was
William
Crowder,
a
game-keeper
in
the
employ
of
Mr.
Turner.
Both
these
witnesses
depose
that
Mr.
McCarthy
was
walking
alone.
The
game-keeper
adds
that
within
a
few
minutes
of
his
seeing
Mr.
McCarthy
pass
he
had
seen
his
son,
Mr.
James
McCarthy,
going
the
same
way
with
a
gun
under
his
arm.
To
the
best
of
his
belief,
the
father
was
actually
in
sight
at
the
time,
and
the
son
was
following
him.
He
thought
no
more
of
the
matter
until
he
heard
in
the
evening
of
the
tragedy
that
had
occurred.
"The
two
McCarthys
were
seen
after
the
time
when
William
Crowder,
the
game-keeper,
lost
sight
of
them.
The
Boscombe
Pool
is
thickly
wooded
round,
with
just
a
fringe
of
grass
and
of
reeds
round
the
edge.
A
girl
of
fourteen,
Patience
Moran,
who
is
the
daughter
of
the
lodge-keeper
of
the
Boscombe
Valley
estate,
was
in
one
of
the
woods
picking
flowers.
She
states
that
while
she
was
there
she
saw,
at
the
border
of
the
wood
and
close
by
the
lake,
Mr.
McCarthy
and
his
son,
and
that
they
appeared
to
be
having
a
violent
quarrel.
She
heard
Mr.
McCarthy
the
elder
using
very
strong
language
to
his
son,
and
she
saw
the
latter
raise
up
his
hand
as
if
to
strike
his
father.
She
was
so
frightened
by
their
violence
that
she
ran
away
and
told
her
mother
when
she
reached
home
that
she
had
left
the
two
McCarthys
quarrelling
near
Boscombe
Pool,
and
that
she
was
afraid
that
they
were
going
to
fight.
She
had
hardly
said
the
words
when
young
Mr.
McCarthy
came
running
up
to
the
lodge
to
say
that
he
had
found
his
father
dead
in
the
wood,
and
to
ask
for
the
help
of
the
lodge-keeper.
He
was
much
excited,
without
either
his
gun
or
his
hat,
and
his
right
hand
and
sleeve
were
observed
to
be
stained
with
fresh
blood.
On
following
him
they
found
the
dead
body
stretched
out
upon
the
grass
beside
the
pool.
The
head
had
been
beaten
in
by
repeated
blows
of
some
heavy
and
blunt
weapon.
The
injuries
were
such
as
might
very
well
have
been
inflicted
by
the
butt-end
of
his
son's
gun,
which
was
found
lying
on
the
grass
within
a
few
paces
of
the
body.
Under
these
circumstances
the
young
man
was
instantly
arrested,
and
a
verdict
of
'wilful
murder'
having
been
returned
at
the
inquest
on
Tuesday,
he
was
on
Wednesday
brought
before
the
magistrates
at
Ross,
who
have
referred
the
case
to
the
next
Assizes.
Those
are
the
main
facts
of
the
case
as
they
came
out
before
the
coroner
and
the
police-court."
"I
could
hardly
imagine
a
more
damning
case,"
I
remarked.
"If
ever
circumstantial
evidence
pointed
to
a
criminal
it
does
so
here."
"Circumstantial
evidence
is
a
very
tricky
thing,"
answered
Holmes
thoughtfully.
"It
may
seem
to
point
very
straight
to
one
thing,
but
if
you
shift
your
own
point
of
view
a
little,
you
may
find
it
pointing
in
an
equally
uncompromising
manner
to
something
entirely
different.
It
must
be
confessed,
however,
that
the
case
looks
exceedingly
grave
against
the
young
man,
and
it
is
very
possible
that
he
is
indeed
the
culprit.
There
are
several
people
in
the
neighbourhood,
however,
and
among
them
Miss
Turner,
the
daughter
of
the
neighbouring
landowner,
who
believe
in
his
innocence,
and
who
have
retained
Lestrade,
whom
you
may
recollect
in
connection
with
the
Study
in
Scarlet,
to
work
out
the
case
in
his
interest.
Lestrade,
being
rather
puzzled,
has
referred
the
case
to
me,
and
hence
it
is
that
two
middle-aged
gentlemen
are
flying
westward
at
fifty
miles
an
hour
instead
of
quietly
digesting
their
breakfasts
at
home."
"I
am
afraid,"
said
I,
"that
the
facts
are
so
obvious
that
you
will
find
little
credit
to
be
gained
out
of
this
case."
"There
is
nothing
more
deceptive
than
an
obvious
fact,"
he
answered,
laughing.
"Besides,
we
may
chance
to
hit
upon
some
other
obvious
facts
which
may
have
been
by
no
means
obvious
to
Mr.
Lestrade.
You
know
me
too
well
to
think
that
I
am
boasting
when
I
say
that
I
shall
either
confirm
or
destroy
his
theory
by
means
which
he
is
quite
incapable
of
employing,
or
even
of
understanding.
To
take
the
first
example
to
hand,
I
very
clearly
perceive
that
in
your
bedroom
the
window
is
upon
the
right-hand
side,
and
yet
I
question
whether
Mr.
Lestrade
would
have
noted
even
so
self-evident
a
thing
as
that."
"How
on
earth--"
"My
dear
fellow,
I
know
you
well.
I
know
the
military
neatness
which
characterises
you.
You
shave
every
morning,
and
in
this
season
you
shave
by
the
sunlight;
but
since
your
shaving
is
less
and
less
complete
as
we
get
farther
back
on
the
left
side,
until
it
becomes
positively
slovenly
as
we
get
round
the
angle
of
the
jaw,
it
is
surely
very
clear
that
that
side
is
less
illuminated
than
the
other.
I
could
not
imagine
a
man
of
your
habits
looking
at
himself
in
an
equal
light
and
being
satisfied
with
such
a
result.
I
only
quote
this
as
a
trivial
example
of
observation
and
inference.
Therein
lies
my
métier,
and
it
is
just
possible
that
it
may
be
of
some
service
in
the
investigation
which
lies
before
us.
There
are
one
or
two
minor
points
which
were
brought
out
in
the
inquest,
and
which
are
worth
considering."
"What
are
they?"
"It
appears
that
his
arrest
did
not
take
place
at
once,
but
after
the
return
to
Hatherley
Farm.
On
the
inspector
of
constabulary
informing
him
that
he
was
a
prisoner,
he
remarked
that
he
was
not
surprised
to
hear
it,
and
that
it
was
no
more
than
his
deserts.
This
observation
of
his
had
the
natural
effect
of
removing
any
traces
of
doubt
which
might
have
remained
in
the
minds
of
the
coroner's
jury."
"It
was
a
confession,"
I
ejaculated.
"No,
for
it
was
followed
by
a
protestation
of
innocence."
"Coming
on
the
top
of
such
a
damning
series
of
events,
it
was
at
least
a
most
suspicious
remark."
"On
the
contrary,"
said
Holmes,
"it
is
the
brightest
rift
which
I
can
at
present
see
in
the
clouds.
However
innocent
he
might
be,
he
could
not
be
such
an
absolute
imbecile
as
not
to
see
that
the
circumstances
were
very
black
against
him.
Had
he
appeared
surprised
at
his
own
arrest,
or
feigned
indignation
at
it,
I
should
have
looked
upon
it
as
highly
suspicious,
because
such
surprise
or
anger
would
not
be
natural
under
the
circumstances,
and
yet
might
appear
to
be
the
best
policy
to
a
scheming
man.
His
frank
acceptance
of
the
situation
marks
him
as
either
an
innocent
man,
or
else
as
a
man
of
considerable
self-restraint
and
firmness.
As
to
his
remark
about
his
deserts,
it
was
also
not
unnatural
if
you
consider
that
he
stood
beside
the
dead
body
of
his
father,
and
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
had
that
very
day
so
far
forgotten
his
filial
duty
as
to
bandy
words
with
him,
and
even,
according
to
the
little
girl
whose
evidence
is
so
important,
to
raise
his
hand
as
if
to
strike
him.
The
self-reproach
and
contrition
which
are
displayed
in
his
remark
appear
to
me
to
be
the
signs
of
a
healthy
mind
rather
than
of
a
guilty
one."
I
shook
my
head.
"Many
men
have
been
hanged
on
far
slighter
evidence,"
I
remarked.
"So
they
have.
And
many
men
have
been
wrongfully
hanged."
"What
is
the
young
man's
own
account
of
the
matter?"
"It
is,
I
am
afraid,
not
very
encouraging
to
his
supporters,
though
there
are
one
or
two
points
in
it
which
are
suggestive.
You
will
find
it
here,
and
may
read
it
for
yourself."
He
picked
out
from
his
bundle
a
copy
of
the
local
Herefordshire
paper,
and
having
turned
down
the
sheet
he
pointed
out
the
paragraph
in
which
the
unfortunate
young
man
had
given
his
own
statement
of
what
had
occurred.
I
settled
myself
down
in
the
corner
of
the
carriage
and
read
it
very
carefully.
It
ran
in
this
way:
"Mr.
James
McCarthy,
the
only
son
of
the
deceased,
was
then
called
and
gave
evidence
as
follows:
'I
had
been
away
from
home
for
three
days
at
Bristol,
and
had
only
just
returned
upon
the
morning
of
last
Monday,
the
3rd.
My
father
was
absent
from
home
at
the
time
of
my
arrival,
and
I
was
informed
by
the
maid
that
he
had
driven
over
to
Ross
with
John
Cobb,
the
groom.
Shortly
after
my
return
I
heard
the
wheels
of
his
trap
in
the
yard,
and,
looking
out
of
my
window,
I
saw
him
get
out
and
walk
rapidly
out
of
the
yard,
though
I
was
not
aware
in
which
direction
he
was
going.
I
then
took
my
gun
and
strolled
out
in
the
direction
of
the
Boscombe
Pool,
with
the
intention
of
visiting
the
rabbit
warren
which
is
upon
the
other
side.
On
my
way
I
saw
William
Crowder,
the
game-keeper,
as
he
had
stated
in
his
evidence;
but
he
is
mistaken
in
thinking
that
I
was
following
my
father.
I
had
no
idea
that
he
was
in
front
of
me.
When
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
pool
I
heard
a
cry
of
"Cooee!"
which
was
a
usual
signal
between
my
father
and
myself.
I
then
hurried
forward,
and
found
him
standing
by
the
pool.
He
appeared
to
be
much
surprised
at
seeing
me
and
asked
me
rather
roughly
what
I
was
doing
there.
A
conversation
ensued
which
led
to
high
words
and
almost
to
blows,
for
my
father
was
a
man
of
a
very
violent
temper.
Seeing
that
his
passion
was
becoming
ungovernable,
I
left
him
and
returned
towards
Hatherley
Farm.
I
had
not
gone
more
than
150
yards,
however,
when
I
heard
a
hideous
outcry
behind
me,
which
caused
me
to
run
back
again.
I
found
my
father
expiring
upon
the
ground,
with
his
head
terribly
injured.
I
dropped
my
gun
and
held
him
in
my
arms,
but
he
almost
instantly
expired.
I
knelt
beside
him
for
some
minutes,
and
then
made
my
way
to
Mr.
Turner's
lodge-keeper,
his
house
being
the
nearest,
to
ask
for
assistance.
I
saw
no
one
near
my
father
when
I
returned,
and
I
have
no
idea
how
he
came
by
his
injuries.
He
was
not
a
popular
man,
being
somewhat
cold
and
forbidding
in
his
manners,
but
he
had,
as
far
as
I
know,
no
active
enemies.
I
know
nothing
further
of
the
matter.'
"The
Coroner:
Did
your
father
make
any
statement
to
you
before
he
died?
"Witness:
He
mumbled
a
few
words,
but
I
could
only
catch
some
allusion
to
a
rat.
"The
Coroner:
What
did
you
understand
by
that?
"Witness:
It
conveyed
no
meaning
to
me.
I
thought
that
he
was
delirious.
"The
Coroner:
What
was
the
point
upon
which
you
and
your
father
had
this
final
quarrel?
"Witness:
I
should
prefer
not
to
answer.
"The
Coroner:
I
am
afraid
that
I
must
press
it.
"Witness:
It
is
really
impossible
for
me
to
tell
you.
I
can
assure
you
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
sad
tragedy
which
followed.
"The
Coroner:
That
is
for
the
court
to
decide.
I
need
not
point
out
to
you
that
your
refusal
to
answer
will
prejudice
your
case
considerably
in
any
future
proceedings
which
may
arise.
"Witness:
I
must
still
refuse.
"The
Coroner:
I
understand
that
the
cry
of
'Cooee'
was
a
common
signal
between
you
and
your
father?
"Witness:
It
was.
"The
Coroner:
How
was
it,
then,
that
he
uttered
it
before
he
saw
you,
and
before
he
even
knew
that
you
had
returned
from
Bristol?
"Witness
(with
considerable
confusion):
I
do
not
know.
"A
Juryman:
Did
you
see
nothing
which
aroused
your
suspicions
when
you
returned
on
hearing
the
cry
and
found
your
father
fatally
injured?
"Witness:
Nothing
definite.
"The
Coroner:
What
do
you
mean?
"Witness:
I
was
so
disturbed
and
excited
as
I
rushed
out
into
the
open,
that
I
could
think
of
nothing
except
of
my
father.
Yet
I
have
a
vague
impression
that
as
I
ran
forward
something
lay
upon
the
ground
to
the
left
of
me.
It
seemed
to
me
to
be
something
grey
in
colour,
a
coat
of
some
sort,
or
a
plaid
perhaps.
When
I
rose
from
my
father
I
looked
round
for
it,
but
it
was
gone.
"'Do
you
mean
that
it
disappeared
before
you
went
for
help?'
"'Yes,
it
was
gone.'
"'You
cannot
say
what
it
was?'
"'No,
I
had
a
feeling
something
was
there.'
"'How
far
from
the
body?'
"'A
dozen
yards
or
so.'
"'And
how
far
from
the
edge
of
the
wood?'
"'About
the
same.'
"'Then
if
it
was
removed
it
was
while
you
were
within
a
dozen
yards
of
it?'
"'Yes,
but
with
my
back
towards
it.'
"This
concluded
the
examination
of
the
witness."
"I
see,"
said
I
as
I
glanced
down
the
column,
"that
the
coroner
in
his
concluding
remarks
was
rather
severe
upon
young
McCarthy.
He
calls
attention,
and
with
reason,
to
the
discrepancy
about
his
father
having
signalled
to
him
before
seeing
him,
also
to
his
refusal
to
give
details
of
his
conversation
with
his
father,
and
his
singular
account
of
his
father's
dying
words.
They
are
all,
as
he
remarks,
very
much
against
the
son."
Holmes
laughed
softly
to
himself
and
stretched
himself
out
upon
the
cushioned
seat.
"Both
you
and
the
coroner
have
been
at
some
pains,"
said
he,
"to
single
out
the
very
strongest
points
in
the
young
man's
favour.
Don't
you
see
that
you
alternately
give
him
credit
for
having
too
much
imagination
and
too
little?
Too
little,
if
he
could
not
invent
a
cause
of
quarrel
which
would
give
him
the
sympathy
of
the
jury;
too
much,
if
he
evolved
from
his
own
inner
consciousness
anything
so
outré
as
a
dying
reference
to
a
rat,
and
the
incident
of
the
vanishing
cloth.
No,
sir,
I
shall
approach
this
case
from
the
point
of
view
that
what
this
young
man
says
is
true,
and
we
shall
see
whither
that
hypothesis
will
lead
us.
And
now
here
is
my
pocket
Petrarch,
and
not
another
word
shall
I
say
of
this
case
until
we
are
on
the
scene
of
action.
We
lunch
at
Swindon,
and
I
see
that
we
shall
be
there
in
twenty
minutes."
It
was
nearly
four
o'clock
when
we
at
last,
after
passing
through
the
beautiful
Stroud
Valley,
and
over
the
broad
gleaming
Severn,
found
ourselves
at
the
pretty
little
country-town
of
Ross.
A
lean,
ferret-like
man,
furtive
and
sly-looking,
was
waiting
for
us
upon
the
platform.
In
spite
of
the
light
brown
dustcoat
and
leather-leggings
which
he
wore
in
deference
to
his
rustic
surroundings,
I
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
Lestrade,
of
Scotland
Yard.
With
him
we
drove
to
the
Hereford
Arms
where
a
room
had
already
been
engaged
for
us.
"I
have
ordered
a
carriage,"
said
Lestrade
as
we
sat
over
a
cup
of
tea.
"I
knew
your
energetic
nature,
and
that
you
would
not
be
happy
until
you
had
been
on
the
scene
of
the
crime."
"It
was
very
nice
and
complimentary
of
you,"
Holmes
answered.
"It
is
entirely
a
question
of
barometric
pressure."
Lestrade
looked
startled.
"I
do
not
quite
follow,"
he
said.
"How
is
the
glass?
Twenty-nine,
I
see.
No
wind,
and
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky.
I
have
a
caseful
of
cigarettes
here
which
need
smoking,
and
the
sofa
is
very
much
superior
to
the
usual
country
hotel
abomination.
I
do
not
think
that
it
is
probable
that
I
shall
use
the
carriage
to-night."
Lestrade
laughed
indulgently.
"You
have,
no
doubt,
already
formed
your
conclusions
from
the
newspapers,"
he
said.
"The
case
is
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff,
and
the
more
one
goes
into
it
the
plainer
it
becomes.
Still,
of
course,
one
can't
refuse
a
lady,
and
such
a
very
positive
one,
too.
She
has
heard
of
you,
and
would
have
your
opinion,
though
I
repeatedly
told
her
that
there
was
nothing
which
you
could
do
which
I
had
not
already
done.
Why,
bless
my
soul!
here
is
her
carriage
at
the
door."
He
had
hardly
spoken
before
there
rushed
into
the
room
one
of
the
most
lovely
young
women
that
I
have
ever
seen
in
my
life.
Her
violet
eyes
shining,
her
lips
parted,
a
pink
flush
upon
her
cheeks,
all
thought
of
her
natural
reserve
lost
in
her
overpowering
excitement
and
concern.
"Oh,
Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes!"
she
cried,
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
of
us,
and
finally,
with
a
woman's
quick
intuition,
fastening
upon
my
companion,
"I
am
so
glad
that
you
have
come.
I
have
driven
down
to
tell
you
so.
I
know
that
James
didn't
do
it.
I
know
it,
and
I
want
you
to
start
upon
your
work
knowing
it,
too.
Never
let
yourself
doubt
upon
that
point.
We
have
known
each
other
since
we
were
little
children,
and
I
know
his
faults
as
no
one
else
does;
but
he
is
too
tender-hearted
to
hurt
a
fly.
Such
a
charge
is
absurd
to
anyone
who
really
knows
him."
"I
hope
we
may
clear
him,
Miss
Turner,"
said
Sherlock
Holmes.
"You
may
rely
upon
my
doing
all
that
I
can."
"But
you
have
read
the
evidence.
You
have
formed
some
conclusion?
Do
you
not
see
some
loophole,
some
flaw?
Do
you
not
yourself
think
that
he
is
innocent?"
"I
think
that
it
is
very
probable."
"There,
now!"
she
cried,
throwing
back
her
head
and
looking
defiantly
at
Lestrade.
"You
hear!
He
gives
me
hopes."
Lestrade
shrugged
his
shoulders.
"I
am
afraid
that
my
colleague
has
been
a
little
quick
in
forming
his
conclusions,"
he
said.
"But
he
is
right.
Oh!
I
know
that
he
is
right.
James
never
did
it.
And
about
his
quarrel
with
his
father,
I
am
sure
that
the
reason
why
he
would
not
speak
about
it
to
the
coroner
was
because
I
was
concerned
in
it."
"In
what
way?"
asked
Holmes.
"It
is
no
time
for
me
to
hide
anything.
James
and
his
father
had
many
disagreements
about
me.
Mr.
McCarthy
was
very
anxious
that
there
should
be
a
marriage
between
us.
James
and
I
have
always
loved
each
other
as
brother
and
sister;
but
of
course
he
is
young
and
has
seen
very
little
of
life
yet,
and--and--well,
he
naturally
did
not
wish
to
do
anything
like
that
yet.
So
there
were
quarrels,
and
this,
I
am
sure,
was
one
of
them."
"And
your
father?"
asked
Holmes.
"Was
he
in
favour
of
such
a
union?"
"No,
he
was
averse
to
it
also.
No
one
but
Mr.
McCarthy
was
in
favour
of
it."
A
quick
blush
passed
over
her
fresh
young
face
as
Holmes
shot
one
of
his
keen,
questioning
glances
at
her.
"Thank
you
for
this
information,"
said
he.
"May
I
see
your
father
if
I
call
to-morrow?"
"I
am
afraid
the
doctor
won't
allow
it."
"The
doctor?"
"Yes,
have
you
not
heard?
Poor
father
has
never
been
strong
for
years
back,
but
this
has
broken
him
down
completely.
He
has
taken
to
his
bed,
and
Dr.
Willows
says
that
he
is
a
wreck
and
that
his
nervous
system
is
shattered.
Mr.
McCarthy
was
the
only
man
alive
who
had
known
dad
in
the
old
days
in
Victoria."
"Ha!
In
Victoria!
That
is
important."
"Yes,
at
the
mines."
"Quite
so;
at
the
gold-mines,
where,
as
I
understand,
Mr.
Turner
made
his
money."
"Yes,
certainly."
"Thank
you,
Miss
Turner.
You
have
been
of
material
assistance
to
me."
"You
will
tell
me
if
you
have
any
news
to-morrow.
No
doubt
you
will
go
to
the
prison
to
see
James.
Oh,
if
you
do,
Mr.
Holmes,
do
tell
him
that
I
know
him
to
be
innocent."
"I
will,
Miss
Turner."
"I
must
go
home
now,
for
dad
is
very
ill,
and
he
misses
me
so
if
I
leave
him.
Good-bye,
and
God
help
you
in
your
undertaking."
She
hurried
from
the
room
as
impulsively
as
she
had
entered,
and
we
heard
the
wheels
of
her
carriage
rattle
off
down
the
street.
"I
am
ashamed
of
you,
Holmes,"
said
Lestrade
with
dignity
after
a
few
minutes'
silence.
"Why
should
you
raise
up
hopes
which
you
are
bound
to
disappoint?
I
am
not
over-tender
of
heart,
but
I
call
it
cruel."
"I
think
that
I
see
my
way
to
clearing
James
McCarthy,"
said
Holmes.
"Have
you
an
order
to
see
him
in
prison?"
"Yes,
but
only
for
you
and
me."
"Then
I
shall
reconsider
my
resolution
about
going
out.
We
have
still
time
to
take
a
train
to
Hereford
and
see
him
to-night?"
"Ample."
"Then
let
us
do
so.
Watson,
I
fear
that
you
will
find
it
very
slow,
but
I
shall
only
be
away
a
couple
of
hours."
I
walked
down
to
the
station
with
them,
and
then
wandered
through
the
streets
of
the
little
town,
finally
returning
to
the
hotel,
where
I
lay
upon
the
sofa
and
tried
to
interest
myself
in
a
yellow-backed
novel.
The
puny
plot
of
the
story
was
so
thin,
however,
when
compared
to
the
deep
mystery
through
which
we
were
groping,
and
I
found
my
attention
wander
so
continually
from
the
action
to
the
fact,
that
I
at
last
flung
it
across
the
room
and
gave
myself
up
entirely
to
a
consideration
of
the
events
of
the
day.
Supposing
that
this
unhappy
young
man's
story
were
absolutely
true,
then
what
hellish
thing,
what
absolutely
unforeseen
and
extraordinary
calamity
could
have
occurred
between
the
time
when
he
parted
from
his
father,
and
the
moment
when,
drawn
back
by
his
screams,
he
rushed
into
the
glade?
It
was
something
terrible
and
deadly.
What
could
it
be?
Might
not
the
nature
of
the
injuries
reveal
something
to
my
medical
instincts?
I
rang
the
bell
and
called
for
the
weekly
county
paper,
which
contained
a
verbatim
account
of
the
inquest.
In
the
surgeon's
deposition
it
was
stated
that
the
posterior
third
of
the
left
parietal
bone
and
the
left
half
of
the
occipital
bone
had
been
shattered
by
a
heavy
blow
from
a
blunt
weapon.
I
marked
the
spot
upon
my
own
head.
Clearly
such
a
blow
must
have
been
struck
from
behind.
That
was
to
some
extent
in
favour
of
the
accused,
as
when
seen
quarrelling
he
was
face
to
face
with
his
father.
Still,
it
did
not
go
for
very
much,
for
the
older
man
might
have
turned
his
back
before
the
blow
fell.
Still,
it
might
be
worth
while
to
call
Holmes'
attention
to
it.
Then
there
was
the
peculiar
dying
reference
to
a
rat.
What
could
that
mean?
It
could
not
be
delirium.
A
man
dying
from
a
sudden
blow
does
not
commonly
become
delirious.
No,
it
was
more
likely
to
be
an
attempt
to
explain
how
he
met
his
fate.
But
what
could
it
indicate?
I
cudgelled
my
brains
to
find
some
possible
explanation.
And
then
the
incident
of
the
grey
cloth
seen
by
young
McCarthy.
If
that
were
true
the
murderer
must
have
dropped
some
part
of
his
dress,
presumably
his
overcoat,
in
his
flight,
and
must
have
had
the
hardihood
to
return
and
to
carry
it
away
at
the
instant
when
the
son
was
kneeling
with
his
back
turned
not
a
dozen
paces
off.
What
a
tissue
of
mysteries
and
improbabilities
the
whole
thing
was!
I
did
not
wonder
at
Lestrade's
opinion,
and
yet
I
had
so
much
faith
in
Sherlock
Holmes'
insight
that
I
could
not
lose
hope
as
long
as
every
fresh
fact
seemed
to
strengthen
his
conviction
of
young
McCarthy's
innocence.
It
was
late
before
Sherlock
Holmes
returned.
He
came
back
alone,
for
Lestrade
was
staying
in
lodgings
in
the
town.
"The
glass
still
keeps
very
high,"
he
remarked
as
he
sat
down.
"It
is
of
importance
that
it
should
not
rain
before
we
are
able
to
go
over
the
ground.
On
the
other
hand,
a
man
should
be
at
his
very
best
and
keenest
for
such
nice
work
as
that,
and
I
did
not
wish
to
do
it
when
fagged
by
a
long
journey.
I
have
seen
young
McCarthy."
"And
what
did
you
learn
from
him?"
"Nothing."
"Could
he
throw
no
light?"
"None
at
all.
I
was
inclined
to
think
at
one
time
that
he
knew
who
had
done
it
and
was
screening
him
or
her,
but
I
am
convinced
now
that
he
is
as
puzzled
as
everyone
else.
He
is
not
a
very
quick-witted
youth,
though
comely
to
look
at
and,
I
should
think,
sound
at
heart."
"I
cannot
admire
his
taste,"
I
remarked,
"if
it
is
indeed
a
fact
that
he
was
averse
to
a
marriage
with
so
charming
a
young
lady
as
this
Miss
Turner."
"Ah,
thereby
hangs
a
rather
painful
tale.
This
fellow
is
madly,
insanely,
in
love
with
her,
but
some
two
years
ago,
when
he
was
only
a
lad,
and
before
he
really
knew
her,
for
she
had
been
away
five
years
at
a
boarding-school,
what
does
the
idiot
do
but
get
into
the
clutches
of
a
barmaid
in
Bristol
and
marry
her
at
a
registry
office?
No
one
knows
a
word
of
the
matter,
but
you
can
imagine
how
maddening
it
must
be
to
him
to
be
upbraided
for
not
doing
what
he
would
give
his
very
eyes
to
do,
but
what
he
knows
to
be
absolutely
impossible.
It
was
sheer
frenzy
of
this
sort
which
made
him
throw
his
hands
up
into
the
air
when
his
father,
at
their
last
interview,
was
goading
him
on
to
propose
to
Miss
Turner.
On
the
other
hand,
he
had
no
means
of
supporting
himself,
and
his
father,
who
was
by
all
accounts
a
very
hard
man,
would
have
thrown
him
over
utterly
had
he
known
the
truth.
It
was
with
his
barmaid
wife
that
he
had
spent
the
last
three
days
in
Bristol,
and
his
father
did
not
know
where
he
was.
Mark
that
point.
It
is
of
importance.
Good
has
come
out
of
evil,
however,
for
the
barmaid,
finding
from
the
papers
that
he
is
in
serious
trouble
and
likely
to
be
hanged,
has
thrown
him
over
utterly
and
has
written
to
him
to
say
that
she
has
a
husband
already
in
the
Bermuda
Dockyard,
so
that
there
is
really
no
tie
between
them.
I
think
that
that
bit
of
news
has
consoled
young
McCarthy
for
all
that
he
has
suffered."
"But
if
he
is
innocent,
who
has
done
it?"
"Ah!
who?
I
would
call
your
attention
very
particularly
to
two
points.
One
is
that
the
murdered
man
had
an
appointment
with
someone
at
the
pool,
and
that
the
someone
could
not
have
been
his
son,
for
his
son
was
away,
and
he
did
not
know
when
he
would
return.
The
second
is
that
the
murdered
man
was
heard
to
cry
'Cooee!'
before
he
knew
that
his
son
had
returned.
Those
are
the
crucial
points
upon
which
the
case
depends.
And
now
let
us
talk
about
George
Meredith,
if
you
please,
and
we
shall
leave
all
minor
matters
until
to-morrow."
There
was
no
rain,
as
Holmes
had
foretold,
and
the
morning
broke
bright
and
cloudless.
At
nine
o'clock
Lestrade
called
for
us
with
the
carriage,
and
we
set
off
for
Hatherley
Farm
and
the
Boscombe
Pool.
"There
is
serious
news
this
morning,"
Lestrade
observed.
"It
is
said
that
Mr.
Turner,
of
the
Hall,
is
so
ill
that
his
life
is
despaired
of."
"An
elderly
man,
I
presume?"
said
Holmes.
"About
sixty;
but
his
constitution
has
been
shattered
by
his
life
abroad,
and
he
has
been
in
failing
health
for
some
time.
This
business
has
had
a
very
bad
effect
upon
him.
He
was
an
old
friend
of
McCarthy's,
and,
I
may
add,
a
great
benefactor
to
him,
for
I
have
learned
that
he
gave
him
Hatherley
Farm
rent
free."
"Indeed!
That
is
interesting,"
said
Holmes.
"Oh,
yes!
In
a
hundred
other
ways
he
has
helped
him.
Everybody
about
here
speaks
of
his
kindness
to
him."
"Really!
Does
it
not
strike
you
as
a
little
singular
that
this
McCarthy,
who
appears
to
have
had
little
of
his
own,
and
to
have
been
under
such
obligations
to
Turner,
should
still
talk
of
marrying
his
son
to
Turner's
daughter,
who
is,
presumably,
heiress
to
the
estate,
and
that
in
such
a
very
cocksure
manner,
as
if
it
were
merely
a
case
of
a
proposal
and
all
else
would
follow?
It
is
the
more
strange,
since
we
know
that
Turner
himself
was
averse
to
the
idea.
The
daughter
told
us
as
much.
Do
you
not
deduce
something
from
that?"
"We
have
got
to
the
deductions
and
the
inferences,"
said
Lestrade,
winking
at
me.
"I
find
it
hard
enough
to
tackle
facts,
Holmes,
without
flying
away
after
theories
and
fancies."
"You
are
right,"
said
Holmes
demurely;
"you
do
find
it
very
hard
to
tackle
the
facts."
"Anyhow,
I
have
grasped
one
fact
which
you
seem
to
find
it
difficult
to
get
hold
of,"
replied
Lestrade
with
some
warmth.
"And
that
is--"
"That
McCarthy
senior
met
his
death
from
McCarthy
junior
and
that
all
theories
to
the
contrary
are
the
merest
moonshine."
"Well,
moonshine
is
a
brighter
thing
than
fog,"
said
Holmes,
laughing.
"But
I
am
very
much
mistaken
if
this
is
not
Hatherley
Farm
upon
the
left."
"Yes,
that
is
it."
It
was
a
widespread,
comfortable-looking
building,
two-storied,
slate-roofed,
with
great
yellow
blotches
of
lichen
upon
the
grey
walls.
The
drawn
blinds
and
the
smokeless
chimneys,
however,
gave
it
a
stricken
look,
as
though
the
weight
of
this
horror
still
lay
heavy
upon
it.
We
called
at
the
door,
when
the
maid,
at
Holmes'
request,
showed
us
the
boots
which
her
master
wore
at
the
time
of
his
death,
and
also
a
pair
of
the
son's,
though
not
the
pair
which
he
had
then
had.
Having
measured
these
very
carefully
from
seven
or
eight
different
points,
Holmes
desired
to
be
led
to
the
court-yard,
from
which
we
all
followed
the
winding
track
which
led
to
Boscombe
Pool.
Sherlock
Holmes
was
transformed
when
he
was
hot
upon
such
a
scent
as
this.
Men
who
had
only
known
the
quiet
thinker
and
logician
of
Baker
Street
would
have
failed
to
recognise
him.
His
face
flushed
and
darkened.
His
brows
were
drawn
into
two
hard
black
lines,
while
his
eyes
shone
out
from
beneath
them
with
a
steely
glitter.
His
face
was
bent
downward,
his
shoulders
bowed,
his
lips
compressed,
and
the
veins
stood
out
like
whipcord
in
his
long,
sinewy
neck.
His
nostrils
seemed
to
dilate
with
a
purely
animal
lust
for
the
chase,
and
his
mind
was
so
absolutely
concentrated
upon
the
matter
before
him
that
a
question
or
remark
fell
unheeded
upon
his
ears,
or,
at
the
most,
only
provoked
a
quick,
impatient
snarl
in
reply.
Swiftly
and
silently
he
made
his
way
along
the
track
which
ran
through
the
meadows,
and
so
by
way
of
the
woods
to
the
Boscombe
Pool.
It
was
damp,
marshy
ground,
as
is
all
that
district,
and
there
were
marks
of
many
feet,
both
upon
the
path
and
amid
the
short
grass
which
bounded
it
on
either
side.
Sometimes
Holmes
would
hurry
on,
sometimes
stop
dead,
and
once
he
made
quite
a
little
detour
into
the
meadow.
Lestrade
and
I
walked
behind
him,
the
detective
indifferent
and
contemptuous,
while
I
watched
my
friend
with
the
interest
which
sprang
from
the
conviction
that
every
one
of
his
actions
was
directed
towards
a
definite
end.
The
Boscombe
Pool,
which
is
a
little
reed-girt
sheet
of
water
some
fifty
yards
across,
is
situated
at
the
boundary
between
the
Hatherley
Farm
and
the
private
park
of
the
wealthy
Mr.
Turner.
Above
the
woods
which
lined
it
upon
the
farther
side
we
could
see
the
red,
jutting
pinnacles
which
marked
the
site
of
the
rich
landowner's
dwelling.
On
the
Hatherley
side
of
the
pool
the
woods
grew
very
thick,
and
there
was
a
narrow
belt
of
sodden
grass
twenty
paces
across
between
the
edge
of
the
trees
and
the
reeds
which
lined
the
lake.
Lestrade
showed
us
the
exact
spot
at
which
the
body
had
been
found,
and,
indeed,
so
moist
was
the
ground,
that
I
could
plainly
see
the
traces
which
had
been
left
by
the
fall
of
the
stricken
man.
To
Holmes,
as
I
could
see
by
his
eager
face
and
peering
eyes,
very
many
other
things
were
to
be
read
upon
the
trampled
grass.
He
ran
round,
like
a
dog
who
is
picking
up
a
scent,
and
then
turned
upon
my
companion.
"What
did
you
go
into
the
pool
for?"
he
asked.
"I
fished
about
with
a
rake.
I
thought
there
might
be
some
weapon
or
other
trace.
But
how
on
earth--"
"Oh,
tut,
tut!
I
have
no
time!
That
left
foot
of
yours
with
its
inward
twist
is
all
over
the
place.
A
mole
could
trace
it,
and
there
it
vanishes
among
the
reeds.
Oh,
how
simple
it
would
all
have
been
had
I
been
here
before
they
came
like
a
herd
of
buffalo
and
wallowed
all
over
it.
Here
is
where
the
party
with
the
lodge-keeper
came,
and
they
have
covered
all
tracks
for
six
or
eight
feet
round
the
body.
But
here
are
three
separate
tracks
of
the
same
feet."
He
drew
out
a
lens
and
lay
down
upon
his
waterproof
to
have
a
better
view,
talking
all
the
time
rather
to
himself
than
to
us.
"These
are
young
McCarthy's
feet.
Twice
he
was
walking,
and
once
he
ran
swiftly,
so
that
the
soles
are
deeply
marked
and
the
heels
hardly
visible.
That
bears
out
his
story.
He
ran
when
he
saw
his
father
on
the
ground.
Then
here
are
the
father's
feet
as
he
paced
up
and
down.
What
is
this,
then?
It
is
the
butt-end
of
the
gun
as
the
son
stood
listening.
And
this?
Ha,
ha!
What
have
we
here?
Tiptoes!
tiptoes!
Square,
too,
quite
unusual
boots!
They
come,
they
go,
they
come
again--of
course
that
was
for
the
cloak.
Now
where
did
they
come
from?"
He
ran
up
and
down,
sometimes
losing,
sometimes
finding
the
track
until
we
were
well
within
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
under
the
shadow
of
a
great
beech,
the
largest
tree
in
the
neighbourhood.
Holmes
traced
his
way
to
the
farther
side
of
this
and
lay
down
once
more
upon
his
face
with
a
little
cry
of
satisfaction.
For
a
long
time
he
remained
there,
turning
over
the
leaves
and
dried
sticks,
gathering
up
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
dust
into
an
envelope
and
examining
with
his
lens
not
only
the
ground
but
even
the
bark
of
the
tree
as
far
as
he
could
reach.
A
jagged
stone
was
lying
among
the
moss,
and
this
also
he
carefully
examined
and
retained.
Then
he
followed
a
pathway
through
the
wood
until
he
came
to
the
highroad,
where
all
traces
were
lost.
"It
has
been
a
case
of
considerable
interest,"
he
remarked,
returning
to
his
natural
manner.
"I
fancy
that
this
grey
house
on
the
right
must
be
the
lodge.
I
think
that
I
will
go
in
and
have
a
word
with
Moran,
and
perhaps
write
a
little
note.
Having
done
that,
we
may
drive
back
to
our
luncheon.
You
may
walk
to
the
cab,
and
I
shall
be
with
you
presently."
It
was
about
ten
minutes
before
we
regained
our
cab
and
drove
back
into
Ross,
Holmes
still
carrying
with
him
the
stone
which
he
had
picked
up
in
the
wood.
"This
may
interest
you,
Lestrade,"
he
remarked,
holding
it
out.
"The
murder
was
done
with
it."
"I
see
no
marks."
"There
are
none."
"How
do
you
know,
then?"
"The
grass
was
growing
under
it.
It
had
only
lain
there
a
few
days.
There
was
no
sign
of
a
place
whence
it
had
been
taken.
It
corresponds
with
the
injuries.
There
is
no
sign
of
any
other
weapon."
"And
the
murderer?"
"Is
a
tall
man,
left-handed,
limps
with
the
right
leg,
wears
thick-soled
shooting-boots
and
a
grey
cloak,
smokes
Indian
cigars,
uses
a
cigar-holder,
and
carries
a
blunt
pen-knife
in
his
pocket.
There
are
several
other
indications,
but
these
may
be
enough
to
aid
us
in
our
search."
Lestrade
laughed.
"I
am
afraid
that
I
am
still
a
sceptic,"
he
said.
"Theories
are
all
very
well,
but
we
have
to
deal
with
a
hard-headed
British
jury."
"Nous
verrons,"
answered
Holmes
calmly.
"You
work
your
own
method,
and
I
shall
work
mine.
I
shall
be
busy
this
afternoon,
and
shall
probably
return
to
London
by
the
evening
train."
"And
leave
your
case
unfinished?"
"No,
finished."
"But
the
mystery?"
"It
is
solved."
"Who
was
the
criminal,
then?"
"The
gentleman
I
describe."
"But
who
is
he?"
"Surely
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
find
out.
This
is
not
such
a
populous
neighbourhood."
Lestrade
shrugged
his
shoulders.
"I
am
a
practical
man,"
he
said,
"and
I
really
cannot
undertake
to
go
about
the
country
looking
for
a
left-handed
gentleman
with
a
game
leg.
I
should
become
the
laughing-stock
of
Scotland
Yard."
"All
right,"
said
Holmes
quietly.
"I
have
given
you
the
chance.
Here
are
your
lodgings.
Good-bye.
I
shall
drop
you
a
line
before
I
leave."
Having
left
Lestrade
at
his
rooms,
we
drove
to
our
hotel,
where
we
found
lunch
upon
the
table.
Holmes
was
silent
and
buried
in
thought
with
a
pained
expression
upon
his
face,
as
one
who
finds
himself
in
a
perplexing
position.
"Look
here,
Watson,"
he
said
when
the
cloth
was
cleared
"just
sit
down
in
this
chair
and
let
me
preach
to
you
for
a
little.
I
don't
know
quite
what
to
do,
and
I
should
value
your
advice.
Light
a
cigar
and
let
me
expound."
"Pray
do
so."
"Well,
now,
in
considering
this
case
there
are
two
points
about
young
McCarthy's
narrative
which
struck
us
both
instantly,
although
they
impressed
me
in
his
favour
and
you
against
him.
One
was
the
fact
that
his
father
should,
according
to
his
account,
cry
'Cooee!'
before
seeing
him.
The
other
was
his
singular
dying
reference
to
a
rat.
He
mumbled
several
words,
you
understand,
but
that
was
all
that
caught
the
son's
ear.
Now
from
this
double
point
our
research
must
commence,
and
we
will
begin
it
by
presuming
that
what
the
lad
says
is
absolutely
true."
"What
of
this
'Cooee!'
then?"
"Well,
obviously
it
could
not
have
been
meant
for
the
son.
The
son,
as
far
as
he
knew,
was
in
Bristol.
It
was
mere
chance
that
he
was
within
earshot.
The
'Cooee!'
was
meant
to
attract
the
attention
of
whoever
it
was
that
he
had
the
appointment
with.
But
'Cooee'
is
a
distinctly
Australian
cry,
and
one
which
is
used
between
Australians.
There
is
a
strong
presumption
that
the
person
whom
McCarthy
expected
to
meet
him
at
Boscombe
Pool
was
someone
who
had
been
in
Australia."
"What
of
the
rat,
then?"
Sherlock
Holmes
took
a
folded
paper
from
his
pocket
and
flattened
it
out
on
the
table.
"This
is
a
map
of
the
Colony
of
Victoria,"
he
said.
"I
wired
to
Bristol
for
it
last
night."
He
put
his
hand
over
part
of
the
map.
"What
do
you
read?"
"ARAT,"
I
read.
"And
now?"
He
raised
his
hand.
"BALLARAT."
"Quite
so.
That
was
the
word
the
man
uttered,
and
of
which
his
son
only
caught
the
last
two
syllables.
He
was
trying
to
utter
the
name
of
his
murderer.
So
and
so,
of
Ballarat."
"It
is
wonderful!"
I
exclaimed.
"It
is
obvious.
And
now,
you
see,
I
had
narrowed
the
field
down
considerably.
The
possession
of
a
grey
garment
was
a
third
point
which,
granting
the
son's
statement
to
be
correct,
was
a
certainty.
We
have
come
now
out
of
mere
vagueness
to
the
definite
conception
of
an
Australian
from
Ballarat
with
a
grey
cloak."
"Certainly."
"And
one
who
was
at
home
in
the
district,
for
the
pool
can
only
be
approached
by
the
farm
or
by
the
estate,
where
strangers
could
hardly
wander."
"Quite
so."
"Then
comes
our
expedition
of
to-day.
By
an
examination
of
the
ground
I
gained
the
trifling
details
which
I
gave
to
that
imbecile
Lestrade,
as
to
the
personality
of
the
criminal."
"But
how
did
you
gain
them?"
"You
know
my
method.
It
is
founded
upon
the
observation
of
trifles."
"His
height
I
know
that
you
might
roughly
judge
from
the
length
of
his
stride.
His
boots,
too,
might
be
told
from
their
traces."
"Yes,
they
were
peculiar
boots."
"But
his
lameness?"
"The
impression
of
his
right
foot
was
always
less
distinct
than
his
left.
He
put
less
weight
upon
it.
Why?
Because
he
limped--he
was
lame."
"But
his
left-handedness."
"You
were
yourself
struck
by
the
nature
of
the
injury
as
recorded
by
the
surgeon
at
the
inquest.
The
blow
was
struck
from
immediately
behind,
and
yet
was
upon
the
left
side.
Now,
how
can
that
be
unless
it
were
by
a
left-handed
man?
He
had
stood
behind
that
tree
during
the
interview
between
the
father
and
son.
He
had
even
smoked
there.
I
found
the
ash
of
a
cigar,
which
my
special
knowledge
of
tobacco
ashes
enables
me
to
pronounce
as
an
Indian
cigar.
I
have,
as
you
know,
devoted
some
attention
to
this,
and
written
a
little
monograph
on
the
ashes
of
140
different
varieties
of
pipe,
cigar,
and
cigarette
tobacco.
Having
found
the
ash,
I
then
looked
round
and
discovered
the
stump
among
the
moss
where
he
had
tossed
it.
It
was
an
Indian
cigar,
of
the
variety
which
are
rolled
in
Rotterdam."
"And
the
cigar-holder?"
"I
could
see
that
the
end
had
not
been
in
his
mouth.
Therefore
he
used
a
holder.
The
tip
had
been
cut
off,
not
bitten
off,
but
the
cut
was
not
a
clean
one,
so
I
deduced
a
blunt
pen-knife."
"Holmes,"
I
said,
"you
have
drawn
a
net
round
this
man
from
which
he
cannot
escape,
and
you
have
saved
an
innocent
human
life
as
truly
as
if
you
had
cut
the
cord
which
was
hanging
him.
I
see
the
direction
in
which
all
this
points.
The
culprit
is--"
"Mr.
John
Turner,"
cried
the
hotel
waiter,
opening
the
door
of
our
sitting-room,
and
ushering
in
a
visitor.
The
man
who
entered
was
a
strange
and
impressive
figure.
His
slow,
limping
step
and
bowed
shoulders
gave
the
appearance
of
decrepitude,
and
yet
his
hard,
deep-lined,
craggy
features,
and
his
enormous
limbs
showed
that
he
was
possessed
of
unusual
strength
of
body
and
of
character.
His
tangled
beard,
grizzled
hair,
and
outstanding,
drooping
eyebrows
combined
to
give
an
air
of
dignity
and
power
to
his
appearance,
but
his
face
was
of
an
ashen
white,
while
his
lips
and
the
corners
of
his
nostrils
were
tinged
with
a
shade
of
blue.
It
was
clear
to
me
at
a
glance
that
he
was
in
the
grip
of
some
deadly
and
chronic
disease.
"Pray
sit
down
on
the
sofa,"
said
Holmes
gently.
"You
had
my
note?"
"Yes,
the
lodge-keeper
brought
it
up.
You
said
that
you
wished
to
see
me
here
to
avoid
scandal."
"I
thought
people
would
talk
if
I
went
to
the
Hall."
"And
why
did
you
wish
to
see
me?"
He
looked
across
at
my
companion
with
despair
in
his
weary
eyes,
as
though
his
question
was
already
answered.
"Yes,"
said
Holmes,
answering
the
look
rather
than
the
words.
"It
is
so.
I
know
all
about
McCarthy."
The
old
man
sank
his
face
in
his
hands.
"God
help
me!"
he
cried.
"But
I
would
not
have
let
the
young
man
come
to
harm.
I
give
you
my
word
that
I
would
have
spoken
out
if
it
went
against
him
at
the
Assizes."
"I
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so,"
said
Holmes
gravely.
"I
would
have
spoken
now
had
it
not
been
for
my
dear
girl.
It
would
break
her
heart--it
will
break
her
heart
when
she
hears
that
I
am
arrested."
"It
may
not
come
to
that,"
said
Holmes.
"What?"
"I
am
no
official
agent.
I
understand
that
it
was
your
daughter
who
required
my
presence
here,
and
I
am
acting
in
her
interests.
Young
McCarthy
must
be
got
off,
however."
"I
am
a
dying
man,"
said
old
Turner.
"I
have
had
diabetes
for
years.
My
doctor
says
it
is
a
question
whether
I
shall
live
a
month.
Yet
I
would
rather
die
under
my
own
roof
than
in
a
gaol."
Holmes
rose
and
sat
down
at
the
table
with
his
pen
in
his
hand
and
a
bundle
of
paper
before
him.
"Just
tell
us
the
truth,"
he
said.
"I
shall
jot
down
the
facts.
You
will
sign
it,
and
Watson
here
can
witness
it.
Then
I
could
produce
your
confession
at
the
last
extremity
to
save
young
McCarthy.
I
promise
you
that
I
shall
not
use
it
unless
it
is
absolutely
needed."
"It's
as
well,"
said
the
old
man;
"it's
a
question
whether
I
shall
live
to
the
Assizes,
so
it
matters
little
to
me,
but
I
should
wish
to
spare
Alice
the
shock.
And
now
I
will
make
the
thing
clear
to
you;
it
has
been
a
long
time
in
the
acting,
but
will
not
take
me
long
to
tell.
"You
didn't
know
this
dead
man,
McCarthy.
He
was
a
devil
incarnate.
I
tell
you
that.
God
keep
you
out
of
the
clutches
of
such
a
man
as
he.
His
grip
has
been
upon
me
these
twenty
years,
and
he
has
blasted
my
life.
I'll
tell
you
first
how
I
came
to
be
in
his
power.
"It
was
in
the
early
'60's
at
the
diggings.
I
was
a
young
chap
then,
hot-blooded
and
reckless,
ready
to
turn
my
hand
at
anything;
I
got
among
bad
companions,
took
to
drink,
had
no
luck
with
my
claim,
took
to
the
bush,
and
in
a
word
became
what
you
would
call
over
here
a
highway
robber.
There
were
six
of
us,
and
we
had
a
wild,
free
life
of
it,
sticking
up
a
station
from
time
to
time,
or
stopping
the
wagons
on
the
road
to
the
diggings.
Black
Jack
of
Ballarat
was
the
name
I
went
under,
and
our
party
is
still
remembered
in
the
colony
as
the
Ballarat
Gang.
"One
day
a
gold
convoy
came
down
from
Ballarat
to
Melbourne,
and
we
lay
in
wait
for
it
and
attacked
it.
There
were
six
troopers
and
six
of
us,
so
it
was
a
close
thing,
but
we
emptied
four
of
their
saddles
at
the
first
volley.
Three
of
our
boys
were
killed,
however,
before
we
got
the
swag.
I
put
my
pistol
to
the
head
of
the
wagon-driver,
who
was
this
very
man
McCarthy.
I
wish
to
the
Lord
that
I
had
shot
him
then,
but
I
spared
him,
though
I
saw
his
wicked
little
eyes
fixed
on
my
face,
as
though
to
remember
every
feature.
We
got
away
with
the
gold,
became
wealthy
men,
and
made
our
way
over
to
England
without
being
suspected.
There
I
parted
from
my
old
pals
and
determined
to
settle
down
to
a
quiet
and
respectable
life.
I
bought
this
estate,
which
chanced
to
be
in
the
market,
and
I
set
myself
to
do
a
little
good
with
my
money,
to
make
up
for
the
way
in
which
I
had
earned
it.
I
married,
too,
and
though
my
wife
died
young
she
left
me
my
dear
little
Alice.
Even
when
she
was
just
a
baby
her
wee
hand
seemed
to
lead
me
down
the
right
path
as
nothing
else
had
ever
done.
In
a
word,
I
turned
over
a
new
leaf
and
did
my
best
to
make
up
for
the
past.
All
was
going
well
when
McCarthy
laid
his
grip
upon
me.
"I
had
gone
up
to
town
about
an
investment,
and
I
met
him
in
Regent
Street
with
hardly
a
coat
to
his
back
or
a
boot
to
his
foot.
"'Here
we
are,
Jack,'
says
he,
touching
me
on
the
arm;
'we'll
be
as
good
as
a
family
to
you.
There's
two
of
us,
me
and
my
son,
and
you
can
have
the
keeping
of
us.
If
you
don't--it's
a
fine,
law-abiding
country
is
England,
and
there's
always
a
policeman
within
hail.'
"Well,
down
they
came
to
the
west
country,
there
was
no
shaking
them
off,
and
there
they
have
lived
rent
free
on
my
best
land
ever
since.
There
was
no
rest
for
me,
no
peace,
no
forgetfulness;
turn
where
I
would,
there
was
his
cunning,
grinning
face
at
my
elbow.
It
grew
worse
as
Alice
grew
up,
for
he
soon
saw
I
was
more
afraid
of
her
knowing
my
past
than
of
the
police.
Whatever
he
wanted
he
must
have,
and
whatever
it
was
I
gave
him
without
question,
land,
money,
houses,
until
at
last
he
asked
a
thing
which
I
could
not
give.
He
asked
for
Alice.
"His
son,
you
see,
had
grown
up,
and
so
had
my
girl,
and
as
I
was
known
to
be
in
weak
health,
it
seemed
a
fine
stroke
to
him
that
his
lad
should
step
into
the
whole
property.
But
there
I
was
firm.
I
would
not
have
his
cursed
stock
mixed
with
mine;
not
that
I
had
any
dislike
to
the
lad,
but
his
blood
was
in
him,
and
that
was
enough.
I
stood
firm.
McCarthy
threatened.
I
braved
him
to
do
his
worst.
We
were
to
meet
at
the
pool
midway
between
our
houses
to
talk
it
over.
"When
I
went
down
there
I
found
him
talking
with
his
son,
so
I
smoked
a
cigar
and
waited
behind
a
tree
until
he
should
be
alone.
But
as
I
listened
to
his
talk
all
that
was
black
and
bitter
in
me
seemed
to
come
uppermost.
He
was
urging
his
son
to
marry
my
daughter
with
as
little
regard
for
what
she
might
think
as
if
she
were
a
slut
from
off
the
streets.
It
drove
me
mad
to
think
that
I
and
all
that
I
held
most
dear
should
be
in
the
power
of
such
a
man
as
this.
Could
I
not
snap
the
bond?
I
was
already
a
dying
and
a
desperate
man.
Though
clear
of
mind
and
fairly
strong
of
limb,
I
knew
that
my
own
fate
was
sealed.
But
my
memory
and
my
girl!
Both
could
be
saved
if
I
could
but
silence
that
foul
tongue.
I
did
it,
Mr.
Holmes.
I
would
do
it
again.
Deeply
as
I
have
sinned,
I
have
led
a
life
of
martyrdom
to
atone
for
it.
But
that
my
girl
should
be
entangled
in
the
same
meshes
which
held
me
was
more
than
I
could
suffer.
I
struck
him
down
with
no
more
compunction
than
if
he
had
been
some
foul
and
venomous
beast.
His
cry
brought
back
his
son;
but
I
had
gained
the
cover
of
the
wood,
though
I
was
forced
to
go
back
to
fetch
the
cloak
which
I
had
dropped
in
my
flight.
That
is
the
true
story,
gentlemen,
of
all
that
occurred."
"Well,
it
is
not
for
me
to
judge
you,"
said
Holmes
as
the
old
man
signed
the
statement
which
had
been
drawn
out.
"I
pray
that
we
may
never
be
exposed
to
such
a
temptation."
"I
pray
not,
sir.
And
what
do
you
intend
to
do?"
"In
view
of
your
health,
nothing.
You
are
yourself
aware
that
you
will
soon
have
to
answer
for
your
deed
at
a
higher
court
than
the
Assizes.
I
will
keep
your
confession,
and
if
McCarthy
is
condemned
I
shall
be
forced
to
use
it.
If
not,
it
shall
never
be
seen
by
mortal
eye;
and
your
secret,
whether
you
be
alive
or
dead,
shall
be
safe
with
us."
"Farewell,
then,"
said
the
old
man
solemnly.
"Your
own
deathbeds,
when
they
come,
will
be
the
easier
for
the
thought
of
the
peace
which
you
have
given
to
mine."
Tottering
and
shaking
in
all
his
giant
frame,
he
stumbled
slowly
from
the
room.
"God
help
us!"
said
Holmes
after
a
long
silence.
"Why
does
fate
play
such
tricks
with
poor,
helpless
worms?
I
never
hear
of
such
a
case
as
this
that
I
do
not
think
of
Baxter's
words,
and
say,
'There,
but
for
the
grace
of
God,
goes
Sherlock
Holmes.'"
James
McCarthy
was
acquitted
at
the
Assizes
on
the
strength
of
a
number
of
objections
which
had
been
drawn
out
by
Holmes
and
submitted
to
the
defending
counsel.
Old
Turner
lived
for
seven
months
after
our
interview,
but
he
is
now
dead;
and
there
is
every
prospect
that
the
son
and
daughter
may
come
to
live
happily
together
in
ignorance
of
the
black
cloud
which
rests
upon
their
past.
ADVENTURE
V.
THE
FIVE
ORANGE
PIPS
When
I
glance
over
my
notes
and
records
of
the
Sherlock
Holmes
cases
between
the
years
'82
and
'90,
I
am
faced
by
so
many
which
present
strange
and
interesting
features
that
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
know
which
to
choose
and
which
to
leave.
Some,
however,
have
already
gained
publicity
through
the
papers,
and
others
have
not
offered
a
field
for
those
peculiar
qualities
which
my
friend
possessed
in
so
high
a
degree,
and
which
it
is
the
object
of
these
papers
to
illustrate.
Some,
too,
have
baffled
his
analytical
skill,
and
would
be,
as
narratives,
beginnings
without
an
ending,
while
others
have
been
but
partially
cleared
up,
and
have
their
explanations
founded
rather
upon
conjecture
and
surmise
than
on
that
absolute
logical
proof
which
was
so
dear
to
him.
There
is,
however,
one
of
these
last
which
was
so
remarkable
in
its
details
and
so
startling
in
its
results
that
I
am
tempted
to
give
some
account
of
it
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
are
points
in
connection
with
it
which
never
have
been,
and
probably
never
will
be,
entirely
cleared
up.
The
year
'87
furnished
us
with
a
long
series
of
cases
of
greater
or
less
interest,
of
which
I
retain
the
records.
Among
my
headings
under
this
one
twelve
months
I
find
an
account
of
the
adventure
of
the
Paradol
Chamber,
of
the
Amateur
Mendicant
Society,
who
held
a
luxurious
club
in
the
lower
vault
of
a
furniture
warehouse,
of
the
facts
connected
with
the
loss
of
the
British
barque
"Sophy
Anderson",
of
the
singular
adventures
of
the
Grice
Patersons
in
the
island
of
Uffa,
and
finally
of
the
Camberwell
poisoning
case.
In
the
latter,
as
may
be
remembered,
Sherlock
Holmes
was
able,
by
winding
up
the
dead
man's
watch,
to
prove
that
it
had
been
wound
up
two
hours
before,
and
that
therefore
the
deceased
had
gone
to
bed
within
that
time--a
deduction
which
was
of
the
greatest
importance
in
clearing
up
the
case.
All
these
I
may
sketch
out
at
some
future
date,
but
none
of
them
present
such
singular
features
as
the
strange
train
of
circumstances
which
I
have
now
taken
up
my
pen
to
describe.
It
was
in
the
latter
days
of
September,
and
the
equinoctial
gales
had
set
in
with
exceptional
violence.
All
day
the
wind
had
screamed
and
the
rain
had
beaten
against
the
windows,
so
that
even
here
in
the
heart
of
great,
hand-made
London
we
were
forced
to
raise
our
minds
for
the
instant
from
the
routine
of
life
and
to
recognise
the
presence
of
those
great
elemental
forces
which
shriek
at
mankind
through
the
bars
of
his
civilisation,
like
untamed
beasts
in
a
cage.
As
evening
drew
in,
the
storm
grew
higher
and
louder,
and
the
wind
cried
and
sobbed
like
a
child
in
the
chimney.
Sherlock
Holmes
sat
moodily
at
one
side
of
the
fireplace
cross-indexing
his
records
of
crime,
while
I
at
the
other
was
deep
in
one
of
Clark
Russell's
fine
sea-stories
until
the
howl
of
the
gale
from
without
seemed
to
blend
with
the
text,
and
the
splash
of
the
rain
to
lengthen
out
into
the
long
swash
of
the
sea
waves.
My
wife
was
on
a
visit
to
her
mother's,
and
for
a
few
days
I
was
a
dweller
once
more
in
my
old
quarters
at
Baker
Street.
"Why,"
said
I,
glancing
up
at
my
companion,
"that
was
surely
the
bell.
Who
could
come
to-night?
Some
friend
of
yours,
perhaps?"
"Except
yourself
I
have
none,"
he
answered.
"I
do
not
encourage
visitors."
"A
client,
then?"
"If
so,
it
is
a
serious
case.
Nothing
less
would
bring
a
man
out
on
such
a
day
and
at
such
an
hour.
But
I
take
it
that
it
is
more
likely
to
be
some
crony
of
the
landlady's."
Sherlock
Holmes
was
wrong
in
his
conjecture,
however,
for
there
came
a
step
in
the
passage
and
a
tapping
at
the
door.
He
stretched
out
his
long
arm
to
turn
the
lamp
away
from
himself
and
towards
the
vacant
chair
upon
which
a
newcomer
must
sit.
"Come
in!"
said
he.
The
man
who
entered
was
young,
some
two-and-twenty
at
the
outside,
well-groomed
and
trimly
clad,
with
something
of
refinement
and
delicacy
in
his
bearing.
The
streaming
umbrella
which
he
held
in
his
hand,
and
his
long
shining
waterproof
told
of
the
fierce
weather
through
which
he
had
come.
He
looked
about
him
anxiously
in
the
glare
of
the
lamp,
and
I
could
see
that
his
face
was
pale
and
his
eyes
heavy,
like
those
of
a
man
who
is
weighed
down
with
some
great
anxiety.
"I
owe
you
an
apology,"
he
said,
raising
his
golden
pince-nez
to
his
eyes.
"I
trust
that
I
am
not
intruding.
I
fear
that
I
have
brought
some
traces
of
the
storm
and
rain
into
your
snug
chamber."
"Give
me
your
coat
and
umbrella,"
said
Holmes.
"They
may
rest
here
on
the
hook
and
will
be
dry
presently.
You
have
come
up
from
the
south-west,
I
see."
"Yes,
from
Horsham."
"That
clay
and
chalk
mixture
which
I
see
upon
your
toe
caps
is
quite
distinctive."
"I
have
come
for
advice."
"That
is
easily
got."
"And
help."
"That
is
not
always
so
easy."
"I
have
heard
of
you,
Mr.
Holmes.
I
heard
from
Major
Prendergast
how
you
saved
him
in
the
Tankerville
Club
scandal."
"Ah,
of
course.
He
was
wrongfully
accused
of
cheating
at
cards."
"He
said
that
you
could
solve
anything."
"He
said
too
much."
"That
you
are
never
beaten."
"I
have
been
beaten
four
times--three
times
by
men,
and
once
by
a
woman."
"But
what
is
that
compared
with
the
number
of
your
successes?"
"It
is
true
that
I
have
been
generally
successful."
"Then
you
may
be
so
with
me."
"I
beg
that
you
will
draw
your
chair
up
to
the
fire
and
favour
me
with
some
details
as
to
your
case."
"It
is
no
ordinary
one."
"None
of
those
which
come
to
me
are.
I
am
the
last
court
of
appeal."
"And
yet
I
question,
sir,
whether,
in
all
your
experience,
you
have
ever
listened
to
a
more
mysterious
and
inexplicable
chain
of
events
than
those
which
have
happened
in
my
own
family."
"You
fill
me
with
interest,"
said
Holmes.
"Pray
give
us
the
essential
facts
from
the
commencement,
and
I
can
afterwards
question
you
as
to
those
details
which
seem
to
me
to
be
most
important."
The
young
man
pulled
his
chair
up
and
pushed
his
wet
feet
out
towards
the
blaze.
"My
name,"
said
he,
"is
John
Openshaw,
but
my
own
affairs
have,
as
far
as
I
can
understand,
little
to
do
with
this
awful
business.
It
is
a
hereditary
matter;
so
in
order
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
facts,
I
must
go
back
to
the
commencement
of
the
affair.
"You
must
know
that
my
grandfather
had
two
sons--my
uncle
Elias
and
my
father
Joseph.
My
father
had
a
small
factory
at
Coventry,
which
he
enlarged
at
the
time
of
the
invention
of
bicycling.
He
was
a
patentee
of
the
Openshaw
unbreakable
tire,
and
his
business
met
with
such
success
that
he
was
able
to
sell
it
and
to
retire
upon
a
handsome
competence.
"My
uncle
Elias
emigrated
to
America
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
became
a
planter
in
Florida,
where
he
was
reported
to
have
done
very
well.
At
the
time
of
the
war
he
fought
in
Jackson's
army,
and
afterwards
under
Hood,
where
he
rose
to
be
a
colonel.
When
Lee
laid
down
his
arms
my
uncle
returned
to
his
plantation,
where
he
remained
for
three
or
four
years.
About
1869
or
1870
he
came
back
to
Europe
and
took
a
small
estate
in
Sussex,
near
Horsham.
He
had
made
a
very
considerable
fortune
in
the
States,
and
his
reason
for
leaving
them
was
his
aversion
to
the
negroes,
and
his
dislike
of
the
Republican
policy
in
extending
the
franchise
to
them.
He
was
a
singular
man,
fierce
and
quick-tempered,
very
foul-mouthed
when
he
was
angry,
and
of
a
most
retiring
disposition.
During
all
the
years
that
he
lived
at
Horsham,
I
doubt
if
ever
he
set
foot
in
the
town.
He
had
a
garden
and
two
or
three
fields
round
his
house,
and
there
he
would
take
his
exercise,
though
very
often
for
weeks
on
end
he
would
never
leave
his
room.
He
drank
a
great
deal
of
brandy
and
smoked
very
heavily,
but
he
would
see
no
society
and
did
not
want
any
friends,
not
even
his
own
brother.
"He
didn't
mind
me;
in
fact,
he
took
a
fancy
to
me,
for
at
the
time
when
he
saw
me
first
I
was
a
youngster
of
twelve
or
so.
This
would
be
in
the
year
1878,
after
he
had
been
eight
or
nine
years
in
England.
He
begged
my
father
to
let
me
live
with
him
and
he
was
very
kind
to
me
in
his
way.
When
he
was
sober
he
used
to
be
fond
of
playing
backgammon
and
draughts
with
me,
and
he
would
make
me
his
representative
both
with
the
servants
and
with
the
tradespeople,
so
that
by
the
time
that
I
was
sixteen
I
was
quite
master
of
the
house.
I
kept
all
the
keys
and
could
go
where
I
liked
and
do
what
I
liked,
so
long
as
I
did
not
disturb
him
in
his
privacy.
There
was
one
singular
exception,
however,
for
he
had
a
single
room,
a
lumber-room
up
among
the
attics,
which
was
invariably
locked,
and
which
he
would
never
permit
either
me
or
anyone
else
to
enter.
With
a
boy's
curiosity
I
have
peeped
through
the
keyhole,
but
I
was
never
able
to
see
more
than
such
a
collection
of
old
trunks
and
bundles
as
would
be
expected
in
such
a
room.
"One
day--it
was
in
March,
1883--a
letter
with
a
foreign
stamp
lay
upon
the
table
in
front
of
the
colonel's
plate.
It
was
not
a
common
thing
for
him
to
receive
letters,
for
his
bills
were
all
paid
in
ready
money,
and
he
had
no
friends
of
any
sort.
'From
India!'
said
he
as
he
took
it
up,
'Pondicherry
postmark!
What
can
this
be?'
Opening
it
hurriedly,
out
there
jumped
five
little
dried
orange
pips,
which
pattered
down
upon
his
plate.
I
began
to
laugh
at
this,
but
the
laugh
was
struck
from
my
lips
at
the
sight
of
his
face.
His
lip
had
fallen,
his
eyes
were
protruding,
his
skin
the
colour
of
putty,
and
he
glared
at
the
envelope
which
he
still
held
in
his
trembling
hand,
'K.
K.
K.!'
he
shrieked,
and
then,
'My
God,
my
God,
my
sins
have
overtaken
me!'
"'What
is
it,
uncle?'
I
cried.
"'Death,'
said
he,
and
rising
from
the
table
he
retired
to
his
room,
leaving
me
palpitating
with
horror.
I
took
up
the
envelope
and
saw
scrawled
in
red
ink
upon
the
inner
flap,
just
above
the
gum,
the
letter
K
three
times
repeated.
There
was
nothing
else
save
the
five
dried
pips.
What
could
be
the
reason
of
his
overpowering
terror?
I
left
the
breakfast-table,
and
as
I
ascended
the
stair
I
met
him
coming
down
with
an
old
rusty
key,
which
must
have
belonged
to
the
attic,
in
one
hand,
and
a
small
brass
box,
like
a
cashbox,
in
the
other.
"'They
may
do
what
they
like,
but
I'll
checkmate
them
still,'
said
he
with
an
oath.
'Tell
Mary
that
I
shall
want
a
fire
in
my
room
to-day,
and
send
down
to
Fordham,
the
Horsham
lawyer.'
"I
did
as
he
ordered,
and
when
the
lawyer
arrived
I
was
asked
to
step
up
to
the
room.
The
fire
was
burning
brightly,
and
in
the
grate
there
was
a
mass
of
black,
fluffy
ashes,
as
of
burned
paper,
while
the
brass
box
stood
open
and
empty
beside
it.
As
I
glanced
at
the
box
I
noticed,
with
a
start,
that
upon
the
lid
was
printed
the
treble
K
which
I
had
read
in
the
morning
upon
the
envelope.
"'I
wish
you,
John,'
said
my
uncle,
'to
witness
my
will.
I
leave
my
estate,
with
all
its
advantages
and
all
its
disadvantages,
to
my
brother,
your
father,
whence
it
will,
no
doubt,
descend
to
you.
If
you
can
enjoy
it
in
peace,
well
and
good!
If
you
find
you
cannot,
take
my
advice,
my
boy,
and
leave
it
to
your
deadliest
enemy.
I
am
sorry
to
give
you
such
a
two-edged
thing,
but
I
can't
say
what
turn
things
are
going
to
take.
Kindly
sign
the
paper
where
Mr.
Fordham
shows
you.'
"I
signed
the
paper
as
directed,
and
the
lawyer
took
it
away
with
him.
The
singular
incident
made,
as
you
may
think,
the
deepest
impression
upon
me,
and
I
pondered
over
it
and
turned
it
every
way
in
my
mind
without
being
able
to
make
anything
of
it.
Yet
I
could
not
shake
off
the
vague
feeling
of
dread
which
it
left
behind,
though
the
sensation
grew
less
keen
as
the
weeks
passed
and
nothing
happened
to
disturb
the
usual
routine
of
our
lives.
I
could
see
a
change
in
my
uncle,
however.
He
drank
more
than
ever,
and
he
was
less
inclined
for
any
sort
of
society.
Most
of
his
time
he
would
spend
in
his
room,
with
the
door
locked
upon
the
inside,
but
sometimes
he
would
emerge
in
a
sort
of
drunken
frenzy
and
would
burst
out
of
the
house
and
tear
about
the
garden
with
a
revolver
in
his
hand,
screaming
out
that
he
was
afraid
of
no
man,
and
that
he
was
not
to
be
cooped
up,
like
a
sheep
in
a
pen,
by
man
or
devil.
When
these
hot
fits
were
over,
however,
he
would
rush
tumultuously
in
at
the
door
and
lock
and
bar
it
behind
him,
like
a
man
who
can
brazen
it
out
no
longer
against
the
terror
which
lies
at
the
roots
of
his
soul.
At
such
times
I
have
seen
his
face,
even
on
a
cold
day,
glisten
with
moisture,
as
though
it
were
new
raised
from
a
basin.
"Well,
to
come
to
an
end
of
the
matter,
Mr.
Holmes,
and
not
to
abuse
your
patience,
there
came
a
night
when
he
made
one
of
those
drunken
sallies
from
which
he
never
came
back.
We
found
him,
when
we
went
to
search
for
him,
face
downward
in
a
little
green-scummed
pool,
which
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
garden.
There
was
no
sign
of
any
violence,
and
the
water
was
but
two
feet
deep,
so
that
the
jury,
having
regard
to
his
known
eccentricity,
brought
in
a
verdict
of
'suicide.'
But
I,
who
knew
how
he
winced
from
the
very
thought
of
death,
had
much
ado
to
persuade
myself
that
he
had
gone
out
of
his
way
to
meet
it.
The
matter
passed,
however,
and
my
father
entered
into
possession
of
the
estate,
and
of
some
14,000
pounds,
which
lay
to
his
credit
at
the
bank."
"One
moment,"
Holmes
interposed,
"your
statement
is,
I
foresee,
one
of
the
most
remarkable
to
which
I
have
ever
listened.
Let
me
have
the
date
of
the
reception
by
your
uncle
of
the
letter,
and
the
date
of
his
supposed
suicide."
"The
letter
arrived
on
March
10,
1883.
His
death
was
seven
weeks
later,
upon
the
night
of
May
2nd."
"Thank
you.
Pray
proceed."
"When
my
father
took
over
the
Horsham
property,
he,
at
my
request,
made
a
careful
examination
of
the
attic,
which
had
been
always
locked
up.
We
found
the
brass
box
there,
although
its
contents
had
been
destroyed.
On
the
inside
of
the
cover
was
a
paper
label,
with
the
initials
of
K.
K.
K.
repeated
upon
it,
and
'Letters,
memoranda,
receipts,
and
a
register'
written
beneath.
These,
we
presume,
indicated
the
nature
of
the
papers
which
had
been
destroyed
by
Colonel
Openshaw.
For
the
rest,
there
was
nothing
of
much
importance
in
the
attic
save
a
great
many
scattered
papers
and
note-books
bearing
upon
my
uncle's
life
in
America.
Some
of
them
were
of
the
war
time
and
showed
that
he
had
done
his
duty
well
and
had
borne
the
repute
of
a
brave
soldier.
Others
were
of
a
date
during
the
reconstruction
of
the
Southern
states,
and
were
mostly
concerned
with
politics,
for
he
had
evidently
taken
a
strong
part
in
opposing
the
carpet-bag
politicians
who
had
been
sent
down
from
the
North.
"Well,
it
was
the
beginning
of
'84
when
my
father
came
to
live
at
Horsham,
and
all
went
as
well
as
possible
with
us
until
the
January
of
'85.
On
the
fourth
day
after
the
new
year
I
heard
my
father
give
a
sharp
cry
of
surprise
as
we
sat
together
at
the
breakfast-table.
There
he
was,
sitting
with
a
newly
opened
envelope
in
one
hand
and
five
dried
orange
pips
in
the
outstretched
palm
of
the
other
one.
He
had
always
laughed
at
what
he
called
my
cock-and-bull
story
about
the
colonel,
but
he
looked
very
scared
and
puzzled
now
that
the
same
thing
had
come
upon
himself.
"'Why,
what
on
earth
does
this
mean,
John?'
he
stammered.
"My
heart
had
turned
to
lead.
'It
is
K.
K.
K.,'
said
I.
"He
looked
inside
the
envelope.
'So
it
is,'
he
cried.
'Here
are
the
very
letters.
But
what
is
this
written
above
them?'
"'Put
the
papers
on
the
sundial,'
I
read,
peeping
over
his
shoulder.
"'What
papers?
What
sundial?'
he
asked.
"'The
sundial
in
the
garden.
There
is
no
other,'
said
I;
'but
the
papers
must
be
those
that
are
destroyed.'
"'Pooh!'
said
he,
gripping
hard
at
his
courage.
'We
are
in
a
civilised
land
here,
and
we
can't
have
tomfoolery
of
this
kind.
Where
does
the
thing
come
from?'
"'From
Dundee,'
I
answered,
glancing
at
the
postmark.
"'Some
preposterous
practical
joke,'
said
he.
'What
have
I
to
do
with
sundials
and
papers?
I
shall
take
no
notice
of
such
nonsense.'
"'I
should
certainly
speak
to
the
police,'
I
said.
"'And
be
laughed
at
for
my
pains.
Nothing
of
the
sort.'
"'Then
let
me
do
so?'
"'No,
I
forbid
you.
I
won't
have
a
fuss
made
about
such
nonsense.'
"It
was
in
vain
to
argue
with
him,
for
he
was
a
very
obstinate
man.
I
went
about,
however,
with
a
heart
which
was
full
of
forebodings.
"On
the
third
day
after
the
coming
of
the
letter
my
father
went
from
home
to
visit
an
old
friend
of
his,
Major
Freebody,
who
is
in
command
of
one
of
the
forts
upon
Portsdown
Hill.
I
was
glad
that
he
should
go,
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
farther
from
danger
when
he
was
away
from
home.
In
that,
however,
I
was
in
error.
Upon
the
second
day
of
his
absence
I
received
a
telegram
from
the
major,
imploring
me
to
come
at
once.
My
father
had
fallen
over
one
of
the
deep
chalk-pits
which
abound
in
the
neighbourhood,
and
was
lying
senseless,
with
a
shattered
skull.
I
hurried
to
him,
but
he
passed
away
without
having
ever
recovered
his
consciousness.
He
had,
as
it
appears,
been
returning
from
Fareham
in
the
twilight,
and
as
the
country
was
unknown
to
him,
and
the
chalk-pit
unfenced,
the
jury
had
no
hesitation
in
bringing
in
a
verdict
of
'death
from
accidental
causes.'
Carefully
as
I
examined
every
fact
connected
with
his
death,
I
was
unable
to
find
anything
which
could
suggest
the
idea
of
murder.
There
were
no
signs
of
violence,
no
footmarks,
no
robbery,
no
record
of
strangers
having
been
seen
upon
the
roads.
And
yet
I
need
not
tell
you
that
my
mind
was
far
from
at
ease,
and
that
I
was
well-nigh
certain
that
some
foul
plot
had
been
woven
round
him.
"In
this
sinister
way
I
came
into
my
inheritance.
You
will
ask
me
why
I
did
not
dispose
of
it?
I
answer,
because
I
was
well
convinced
that
our
troubles
were
in
some
way
dependent
upon
an
incident
in
my
uncle's
life,
and
that
the
danger
would
be
as
pressing
in
one
house
as
in
another.
"It
was
in
January,
'85,
that
my
poor
father
met
his
end,
and
two
years
and
eight
months
have
elapsed
since
then.
During
that
time
I
have
lived
happily
at
Horsham,
and
I
had
begun
to
hope
that
this
curse
had
passed
away
from
the
family,
and
that
it
had
ended
with
the
last
generation.
I
had
begun
to
take
comfort
too
soon,
however;
yesterday
morning
the
blow
fell
in
the
very
shape
in
which
it
had
come
upon
my
father."
The
young
man
took
from
his
waistcoat
a
crumpled
envelope,
and
turning
to
the
table
he
shook
out
upon
it
five
little
dried
orange
pips.
"This
is
the
envelope,"
he
continued.
"The
postmark
is
London--eastern
division.
Within
are
the
very
words
which
were
upon
my
father's
last
message:
'K.
K.
K.';
and
then
'Put
the
papers
on
the
sundial.'"
"What
have
you
done?"
asked
Holmes.
"Nothing."
"Nothing?"
"To
tell
the
truth"--he
sank
his
face
into
his
thin,
white
hands--"I
have
felt
helpless.
I
have
felt
like
one
of
those
poor
rabbits
when
the
snake
is
writhing
towards
it.
I
seem
to
be
in
the
grasp
of
some
resistless,
inexorable
evil,
which
no
foresight
and
no
precautions
can
guard
against."
"Tut!
tut!"
cried
Sherlock
Holmes.
"You
must
act,
man,
or
you
are
lost.
Nothing
but
energy
can
save
you.
This
is
no
time
for
despair."
"I
have
seen
the
police."
"Ah!"
"But
they
listened
to
my
story
with
a
smile.
I
am
convinced
that
the
inspector
has
formed
the
opinion
that
the
letters
are
all
practical
jokes,
and
that
the
deaths
of
my
relations
were
really
accidents,
as
the
jury
stated,
and
were
not
to
be
connected
with
the
warnings."
Holmes
shook
his
clenched
hands
in
the
air.
"Incredible
imbecility!"
he
cried.
"They
have,
however,
allowed
me
a
policeman,
who
may
remain
in
the
house
with
me."
"Has
he
come
with
you
to-night?"
"No.
His
orders
were
to
stay
in
the
house."
Again
Holmes
raved
in
the
air.
"Why
did
you
come
to
me,"
he
cried,
"and,
above
all,
why
did
you
not
come
at
once?"
"I
did
not
know.
It
was
only
to-day
that
I
spoke
to
Major
Prendergast
about
my
troubles
and
was
advised
by
him
to
come
to
you."
"It
is
really
two
days
since
you
had
the
letter.
We
should
have
acted
before
this.
You
have
no
further
evidence,
I
suppose,
than
that
which
you
have
placed
before
us--no
suggestive
detail
which
might
help
us?"
"There
is
one
thing,"
said
John
Openshaw.
He
rummaged
in
his
coat
pocket,
and,
drawing
out
a
piece
of
discoloured,
blue-tinted
paper,
he
laid
it
out
upon
the
table.
"I
have
some
remembrance,"
said
he,
"that
on
the
day
when
my
uncle
burned
the
papers
I
observed
that
the
small,
unburned
margins
which
lay
amid
the
ashes
were
of
this
particular
colour.
I
found
this
single
sheet
upon
the
floor
of
his
room,
and
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
it
may
be
one
of
the
papers
which
has,
perhaps,
fluttered
out
from
among
the
others,
and
in
that
way
has
escaped
destruction.
Beyond
the
mention
of
pips,
I
do
not
see
that
it
helps
us
much.
I
think
myself
that
it
is
a
page
from
some
private
diary.
The
writing
is
undoubtedly
my
uncle's."
Holmes
moved
the
lamp,
and
we
both
bent
over
the
sheet
of
paper,
which
showed
by
its
ragged
edge
that
it
had
indeed
been
torn
from
a
book.
It
was
headed,
"March,
1869,"
and
beneath
were
the
following
enigmatical
notices:
"4th.
Hudson
came.
Same
old
platform.
"7th.
Set
the
pips
on
McCauley,
Paramore,
and
John
Swain,
of
St.
Augustine.
"9th.
McCauley
cleared.
"10th.
John
Swain
cleared.
"12th.
Visited
Paramore.
All
well."
"Thank
you!"
said
Holmes,
folding
up
the
paper
and
returning
it
to
our
visitor.
"And
now
you
must
on
no
account
lose
another
instant.
We
cannot
spare
time
even
to
discuss
what
you
have
told
me.
You
must
get
home
instantly
and
act."
"What
shall
I
do?"
"There
is
but
one
thing
to
do.
It
must
be
done
at
once.
You
must
put
this
piece
of
paper
which
you
have
shown
us
into
the
brass
box
which
you
have
described.
You
must
also
put
in
a
note
to
say
that
all
the
other
papers
were
burned
by
your
uncle,
and
that
this
is
the
only
one
which
remains.
You
must
assert
that
in
such
words
as
will
carry
conviction
with
them.
Having
done
this,
you
must
at
once
put
the
box
out
upon
the
sundial,
as
directed.
Do
you
understand?"
"Entirely."
"Do
not
think
of
revenge,
or
anything
of
the
sort,
at
present.
I
think
that
we
may
gain
that
by
means
of
the
law;
but
we
have
our
web
to
weave,
while
theirs
is
already
woven.
The
first
consideration
is
to
remove
the
pressing
danger
which
threatens
you.
The
second
is
to
clear
up
the
mystery
and
to
punish
the
guilty
parties."
"I
thank
you,"
said
the
young
man,
rising
and
pulling
on
his
overcoat.
"You
have
given
me
fresh
life
and
hope.
I
shall
certainly
do
as
you
advise."
"Do
not
lose
an
instant.
And,
above
all,
take
care
of
yourself
in
the
meanwhile,
for
I
do
not
think
that
there
can
be
a
doubt
that
you
are
threatened
by
a
very
real
and
imminent
danger.
How
do
you
go
back?"
"By
train
from
Waterloo."
"It
is
not
yet
nine.
The
streets
will
be
crowded,
so
I
trust
that
you
may
be
in
safety.
And
yet
you
cannot
guard
yourself
too
closely."
"I
am
armed."
"That
is
well.
To-morrow
I
shall
set
to
work
upon
your
case."
"I
shall
see
you
at
Horsham,
then?"
"No,
your
secret
lies
in
London.
It
is
there
that
I
shall
seek
it."
"Then
I
shall
call
upon
you
in
a
day,
or
in
two
days,
with
news
as
to
the
box
and
the
papers.
I
shall
take
your
advice
in
every
particular."
He
shook
hands
with
us
and
took
his
leave.
Outside
the
wind
still
screamed
and
the
rain
splashed
and
pattered
against
the
windows.
This
strange,
wild
story
seemed
to
have
come
to
us
from
amid
the
mad
elements--blown
in
upon
us
like
a
sheet
of
sea-weed
in
a
gale--and
now
to
have
been
reabsorbed
by
them
once
more.
Sherlock
Holmes
sat
for
some
time
in
silence,
with
his
head
sunk
forward
and
his
eyes
bent
upon
the
red
glow
of
the
fire.
Then
he
lit
his
pipe,
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
he
watched
the
blue
smoke-rings
as
they
chased
each
other
up
to
the
ceiling.
"I
think,
Watson,"
he
remarked
at
last,
"that
of
all
our
cases
we
have
had
none
more
fantastic
than
this."
"Save,
perhaps,
the
Sign
of
Four."
"Well,
yes.
Save,
perhaps,
that.
And
yet
this
John
Openshaw
seems
to
me
to
be
walking
amid
even
greater
perils
than
did
the
Sholtos."
"But
have
you,"
I
asked,
"formed
any
definite
conception
as
to
what
these
perils
are?"
"There
can
be
no
question
as
to
their
nature,"
he
answered.
"Then
what
are
they?
Who
is
this
K.
K.
K.,
and
why
does
he
pursue
this
unhappy
family?"
Sherlock
Holmes
closed
his
eyes
and
placed
his
elbows
upon
the
arms
of
his
chair,
with
his
finger-tips
together.
"The
ideal
reasoner,"
he
remarked,
"would,
when
he
had
once
been
shown
a
single
fact
in
all
its
bearings,
deduce
from
it
not
only
all
the
chain
of
events
which
led
up
to
it
but
also
all
the
results
which
would
follow
from
it.
As
Cuvier
could
correctly
describe
a
whole
animal
by
the
contemplation
of
a
single
bone,
so
the
observer
who
has
thoroughly
understood
one
link
in
a
series
of
incidents
should
be
able
to
accurately
state
all
the
other
ones,
both
before
and
after.
We
have
not
yet
grasped
the
results
which
the
reason
alone
can
attain
to.
Problems
may
be
solved
in
the
study
which
have
baffled
all
those
who
have
sought
a
solution
by
the
aid
of
their
senses.
To
carry
the
art,
however,
to
its
highest
pitch,
it
is
necessary
that
the
reasoner
should
be
able
to
utilise
all
the
facts
which
have
come
to
his
knowledge;
and
this
in
itself
implies,
as
you
will
readily
see,
a
possession
of
all
knowledge,
which,
even
in
these
days
of
free
education
and
encyclopaedias,
is
a
somewhat
rare
accomplishment.
It
is
not
so
impossible,
however,
that
a
man
should
possess
all
knowledge
which
is
likely
to
be
useful
to
him
in
his
work,
and
this
I
have
endeavoured
in
my
case
to
do.
If
I
remember
rightly,
you
on
one
occasion,
in
the
early
days
of
our
friendship,
defined
my
limits
in
a
very
precise
fashion."
"Yes,"
I
answered,
laughing.
"It
was
a
singular
document.
Philosophy,
astronomy,
and
politics
were
marked
at
zero,
I
remember.
Botany
variable,
geology
profound
as
regards
the
mud-stains
from
any
region
within
fifty
miles
of
town,
chemistry
eccentric,
anatomy
unsystematic,
sensational
literature
and
crime
records
unique,
violin-player,
boxer,
swordsman,
lawyer,
and
self-poisoner
by
cocaine
and
tobacco.
Those,
I
think,
were
the
main
points
of
my
analysis."
Holmes
grinned
at
the
last
item.
"Well,"
he
said,
"I
say
now,
as
I
said
then,
that
a
man
should
keep
his
little
brain-attic
stocked
with
all
the
furniture
that
he
is
likely
to
use,
and
the
rest
he
can
put
away
in
the
lumber-room
of
his
library,
where
he
can
get
it
if
he
wants
it.
Now,
for
such
a
case
as
the
one
which
has
been
submitted
to
us
to-night,
we
need
certainly
to
muster
all
our
resources.
Kindly
hand
me
down
the
letter
K
of
the
'American
Encyclopaedia'
which
stands
upon
the
shelf
beside
you.
Thank
you.
Now
let
us
consider
the
situation
and
see
what
may
be
deduced
from
it.
In
the
first
place,
we
may
start
with
a
strong
presumption
that
Colonel
Openshaw
had
some
very
strong
reason
for
leaving
America.
Men
at
his
time
of
life
do
not
change
all
their
habits
and
exchange
willingly
the
charming
climate
of
Florida
for
the
lonely
life
of
an
English
provincial
town.
His
extreme
love
of
solitude
in
England
suggests
the
idea
that
he
was
in
fear
of
someone
or
something,
so
we
may
assume
as
a
working
hypothesis
that
it
was
fear
of
someone
or
something
which
drove
him
from
America.
As
to
what
it
was
he
feared,
we
can
only
deduce
that
by
considering
the
formidable
letters
which
were
received
by
himself
and
his
successors.
Did
you
remark
the
postmarks
of
those
letters?"
"The
first
was
from
Pondicherry,
the
second
from
Dundee,
and
the
third
from
London."
"From
East
London.
What
do
you
deduce
from
that?"
"They
are
all
seaports.
That
the
writer
was
on
board
of
a
ship."
"Excellent.
We
have
already
a
clue.
There
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
probability--the
strong
probability--is
that
the
writer
was
on
board
of
a
ship.
And
now
let
us
consider
another
point.
In
the
case
of
Pondicherry,
seven
weeks
elapsed
between
the
threat
and
its
fulfilment,
in
Dundee
it
was
only
some
three
or
four
days.
Does
that
suggest
anything?"
"A
greater
distance
to
travel."
"But
the
letter
had
also
a
greater
distance
to
come."
"Then
I
do
not
see
the
point."
"There
is
at
least
a
presumption
that
the
vessel
in
which
the
man
or
men
are
is
a
sailing-ship.
It
looks
as
if
they
always
send
their
singular
warning
or
token
before
them
when
starting
upon
their
mission.
You
see
how
quickly
the
deed
followed
the
sign
when
it
came
from
Dundee.
If
they
had
come
from
Pondicherry
in
a
steamer
they
would
have
arrived
almost
as
soon
as
their
letter.
But,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
seven
weeks
elapsed.
I
think
that
those
seven
weeks
represented
the
difference
between
the
mail-boat
which
brought
the
letter
and
the
sailing
vessel
which
brought
the
writer."
"It
is
possible."
"More
than
that.
It
is
probable.
And
now
you
see
the
deadly
urgency
of
this
new
case,
and
why
I
urged
young
Openshaw
to
caution.
The
blow
has
always
fallen
at
the
end
of
the
time
which
it
would
take
the
senders
to
travel
the
distance.
But
this
one
comes
from
London,
and
therefore
we
cannot
count
upon
delay."
"Good
God!"
I
cried.
"What
can
it
mean,
this
relentless
persecution?"
"The
papers
which
Openshaw
carried
are
obviously
of
vital
importance
to
the
person
or
persons
in
the
sailing-ship.
I
think
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
there
must
be
more
than
one
of
them.
A
single
man
could
not
have
carried
out
two
deaths
in
such
a
way
as
to
deceive
a
coroner's
jury.
There
must
have
been
several
in
it,
and
they
must
have
been
men
of
resource
and
determination.
Their
papers
they
mean
to
have,
be
the
holder
of
them
who
it
may.
In
this
way
you
see
K.
K.
K.
ceases
to
be
the
initials
of
an
individual
and
becomes
the
badge
of
a
society."
"But
of
what
society?"
"Have
you
never--"
said
Sherlock
Holmes,
bending
forward
and
sinking
his
voice--"have
you
never
heard
of
the
Ku
Klux
Klan?"
"I
never
have."
Holmes
turned
over
the
leaves
of
the
book
upon
his
knee.
"Here
it
is,"
said
he
presently:
"'Ku
Klux
Klan.
A
name
derived
from
the
fanciful
resemblance
to
the
sound
produced
by
cocking
a
rifle.
This
terrible
secret
society
was
formed
by
some
ex-Confederate
soldiers
in
the
Southern
states
after
the
Civil
War,
and
it
rapidly
formed
local
branches
in
different
parts
of
the
country,
notably
in
Tennessee,
Louisiana,
the
Carolinas,
Georgia,
and
Florida.
Its
power
was
used
for
political
purposes,
principally
for
the
terrorising
of
the
negro
voters
and
the
murdering
and
driving
from
the
country
of
those
who
were
opposed
to
its
views.
Its
outrages
were
usually
preceded
by
a
warning
sent
to
the
marked
man
in
some
fantastic
but
generally
recognised
shape--a
sprig
of
oak-leaves
in
some
parts,
melon
seeds
or
orange
pips
in
others.
On
receiving
this
the
victim
might
either
openly
abjure
his
former
ways,
or
might
fly
from
the
country.
If
he
braved
the
matter
out,
death
would
unfailingly
come
upon
him,
and
usually
in
some
strange
and
unforeseen
manner.
So
perfect
was
the
organisation
of
the
society,
and
so
systematic
its
methods,
that
there
is
hardly
a
case
upon
record
where
any
man
succeeded
in
braving
it
with
impunity,
or
in
which
any
of
its
outrages
were
traced
home
to
the
perpetrators.
For
some
years
the
organisation
flourished
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
United
States
government
and
of
the
better
classes
of
the
community
in
the
South.
Eventually,
in
the
year
1869,
the
movement
rather
suddenly
collapsed,
although
there
have
been
sporadic
outbreaks
of
the
same
sort
since
that
date.'
"You
will
observe,"
said
Holmes,
laying
down
the
volume,
"that
the
sudden
breaking
up
of
the
society
was
coincident
with
the
disappearance
of
Openshaw
from
America
with
their
papers.
It
may
well
have
been
cause
and
effect.
It
is
no
wonder
that
he
and
his
family
have
some
of
the
more
implacable
spirits
upon
their
track.
You
can
understand
that
this
register
and
diary
may
implicate
some
of
the
first
men
in
the
South,
and
that
there
may
be
many
who
will
not
sleep
easy
at
night
until
it
is
recovered."
"Then
the
page
we
have
seen--"
"Is
such
as
we
might
expect.
It
ran,
if
I
remember
right,
'sent
the
pips
to
A,
B,
and
C'--that
is,
sent
the
society's
warning
to
them.
Then
there
are
successive
entries
that
A
and
B
cleared,
or
left
the
country,
and
finally
that
C
was
visited,
with,
I
fear,
a
sinister
result
for
C.
Well,
I
think,
Doctor,
that
we
may
let
some
light
into
this
dark
place,
and
I
believe
that
the
only
chance
young
Openshaw
has
in
the
meantime
is
to
do
what
I
have
told
him.
There
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
or
to
be
done
to-night,
so
hand
me
over
my
violin
and
let
us
try
to
forget
for
half
an
hour
the
miserable
weather
and
the
still
more
miserable
ways
of
our
fellow-men."
It
had
cleared
in
the
morning,
and
the
sun
was
shining
with
a
subdued
brightness
through
the
dim
veil
which
hangs
over
the
great
city.
Sherlock
Holmes
was
already
at
breakfast
when
I
came
down.
"You
will
excuse
me
for
not
waiting
for
you,"
said
he;
"I
have,
I
foresee,
a
very
busy
day
before
me
in
looking
into
this
case
of
young
Openshaw's."
"What
steps
will
you
take?"
I
asked.
"It
will
very
much
depend
upon
the
results
of
my
first
inquiries.
I
may
have
to
go
down
to
Horsham,
after
all."
"You
will
not
go
there
first?"
"No,
I
shall
commence
with
the
City.
Just
ring
the
bell
and
the
maid
will
bring
up
your
coffee."
As
I
waited,
I
lifted
the
unopened
newspaper
from
the
table
and
glanced
my
eye
over
it.
It
rested
upon
a
heading
which
sent
a
chill
to
my
heart.
"Holmes,"
I
cried,
"you
are
too
late."
"Ah!"
said
he,
laying
down
his
cup,
"I
feared
as
much.
How
was
it
done?"
He
spoke
calmly,
but
I
could
see
that
he
was
deeply
moved.
"My
eye
caught
the
name
of
Openshaw,
and
the
heading
'Tragedy
Near
Waterloo
Bridge.'
Here
is
the
account:
"Between
nine
and
ten
last
night
Police-Constable
Cook,
of
the
H
Division,
on
duty
near
Waterloo
Bridge,
heard
a
cry
for
help
and
a
splash
in
the
water.
The
night,
however,
was
extremely
dark
and
stormy,
so
that,
in
spite
of
the
help
of
several
passers-by,
it
was
quite
impossible
to
effect
a
rescue.
The
alarm,
however,
was
given,
and,
by
the
aid
of
the
water-police,
the
body
was
eventually
recovered.
It
proved
to
be
that
of
a
young
gentleman
whose
name,
as
it
appears
from
an
envelope
which
was
found
in
his
pocket,
was
John
Openshaw,
and
whose
residence
is
near
Horsham.
It
is
conjectured
that
he
may
have
been
hurrying
down
to
catch
the
last
train
from
Waterloo
Station,
and
that
in
his
haste
and
the
extreme
darkness
he
missed
his
path
and
walked
over
the
edge
of
one
of
the
small
landing-places
for
river
steamboats.
The
body
exhibited
no
traces
of
violence,
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
deceased
had
been
the
victim
of
an
unfortunate
accident,
which
should
have
the
effect
of
calling
the
attention
of
the
authorities
to
the
condition
of
the
riverside
landing-stages."
We
sat
in
silence
for
some
minutes,
Holmes
more
depressed
and
shaken
than
I
had
ever
seen
him.
"That
hurts
my
pride,
Watson,"
he
said
at
last.
"It
is
a
petty
feeling,
no
doubt,
but
it
hurts
my
pride.
It
becomes
a
personal
matter
with
me
now,
and,
if
God
sends
me
health,
I
shall
set
my
hand
upon
this
gang.
That
he
should
come
to
me
for
help,
and
that
I
should
send
him
away
to
his
death--!"
He
sprang
from
his
chair
and
paced
about
the
room
in
uncontrollable
agitation,
with
a
flush
upon
his
sallow
cheeks
and
a
nervous
clasping
and
unclasping
of
his
long
thin
hands.
"They
must
be
cunning
devils,"
he
exclaimed
at
last.
"How
could
they
have
decoyed
him
down
there?
The
Embankment
is
not
on
the
direct
line
to
the
station.
The
bridge,
no
doubt,
was
too
crowded,
even
on
such
a
night,
for
their
purpose.
Well,
Watson,
we
shall
see
who
will
win
in
the
long
run.
I
am
going
out
now!"
"To
the
police?"
"No;
I
shall
be
my
own
police.
When
I
have
spun
the
web
they
may
take
the
flies,
but
not
before."
All
day
I
was
engaged
in
my
professional
work,
and
it
was
late
in
the
evening
before
I
returned
to
Baker
Street.
Sherlock
Holmes
had
not
come
back
yet.
It
was
nearly
ten
o'clock
before
he
entered,
looking
pale
and
worn.
He
walked
up
to
the
sideboard,
and
tearing
a
piece
from
the
loaf
he
devoured
it
voraciously,
washing
it
down
with
a
long
draught
of
water.
"You
are
hungry,"
I
remarked.
"Starving.
It
had
escaped
my
memory.
I
have
had
nothing
since
breakfast."
"Nothing?"
"Not
a
bite.
I
had
no
time
to
think
of
it."
"And
how
have
you
succeeded?"
"Well."
"You
have
a
clue?"
"I
have
them
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand.
Young
Openshaw
shall
not
long
remain
unavenged.
Why,
Watson,
let
us
put
their
own
devilish
trade-mark
upon
them.
It
is
well
thought
of!"
"What
do
you
mean?"
He
took
an
orange
from
the
cupboard,
and
tearing
it
to
pieces
he
squeezed
out
the
pips
upon
the
table.
Of
these
he
took
five
and
thrust
them
into
an
envelope.
On
the
inside
of
the
flap
he
wrote
"S.
H.
for
J.
O."
Then
he
sealed
it
and
addressed
it
to
"Captain
James
Calhoun,
Barque
'Lone
Star,'
Savannah,
Georgia."
"That
will
await
him
when
he
enters
port,"
said
he,
chuckling.
"It
may
give
him
a
sleepless
night.
He
will
find
it
as
sure
a
precursor
of
his
fate
as
Openshaw
did
before
him."
"And
who
is
this
Captain
Calhoun?"
"The
leader
of
the
gang.
I
shall
have
the
others,
but
he
first."
"How
did
you
trace
it,
then?"
He
took
a
large
sheet
of
paper
from
his
pocket,
all
covered
with
dates
and
names.
"I
have
spent
the
whole
day,"
said
he,
"over
Lloyd's
registers
and
files
of
the
old
papers,
following
the
future
career
of
every
vessel
which
touched
at
Pondicherry
in
January
and
February
in
'83.
There
were
thirty-six
ships
of
fair
tonnage
which
were
reported
there
during
those
months.
Of
these,
one,
the
'Lone
Star,'
instantly
attracted
my
attention,
since,
although
it
was
reported
as
having
cleared
from
London,
the
name
is
that
which
is
given
to
one
of
the
states
of
the
Union."
"Texas,
I
think."
"I
was
not
and
am
not
sure
which;
but
I
knew
that
the
ship
must
have
an
American
origin."
"What
then?"
"I
searched
the
Dundee
records,
and
when
I
found
that
the
barque
'Lone
Star'
was
there
in
January,
'85,
my
suspicion
became
a
certainty.
I
then
inquired
as
to
the
vessels
which
lay
at
present
in
the
port
of
London."
"Yes?"
"The
'Lone
Star'
had
arrived
here
last
week.
I
went
down
to
the
Albert
Dock
and
found
that
she
had
been
taken
down
the
river
by
the
early
tide
this
morning,
homeward
bound
to
Savannah.
I
wired
to
Gravesend
and
learned
that
she
had
passed
some
time
ago,
and
as
the
wind
is
easterly
I
have
no
doubt
that
she
is
now
past
the
Goodwins
and
not
very
far
from
the
Isle
of
Wight."
"What
will
you
do,
then?"
"Oh,
I
have
my
hand
upon
him.
He
and
the
two
mates,
are
as
I
learn,
the
only
native-born
Americans
in
the
ship.
The
others
are
Finns
and
Germans.
I
know,
also,
that
they
were
all
three
away
from
the
ship
last
night.
I
had
it
from
the
stevedore
who
has
been
loading
their
cargo.
By
the
time
that
their
sailing-ship
reaches
Savannah
the
mail-boat
will
have
carried
this
letter,
and
the
cable
will
have
informed
the
police
of
Savannah
that
these
three
gentlemen
are
badly
wanted
here
upon
a
charge
of
murder."
There
is
ever
a
flaw,
however,
in
the
best
laid
of
human
plans,
and
the
murderers
of
John
Openshaw
were
never
to
receive
the
orange
pips
which
would
show
them
that
another,
as
cunning
and
as
resolute
as
themselves,
was
upon
their
track.
Very
long
and
very
severe
were
the
equinoctial
gales
that
year.
We
waited
long
for
news
of
the
"Lone
Star"
of
Savannah,
but
none
ever
reached
us.
We
did
at
last
hear
that
somewhere
far
out
in
the
Atlantic
a
shattered
stern-post
of
a
boat
was
seen
swinging
in
the
trough
of
a
wave,
with
the
letters
"L.
S."
carved
upon
it,
and
that
is
all
which
we
shall
ever
know
of
the
fate
of
the
"Lone
Star."
ADVENTURE
VI.
THE
MAN
WITH
THE
TWISTED
LIP
Isa
Whitney,
brother
of
the
late
Elias
Whitney,
D.D.,
Principal
of
the
Theological
College
of
St.
George's,
was
much
addicted
to
opium.
The
habit
grew
upon
him,
as
I
understand,
from
some
foolish
freak
when
he
was
at
college;
for
having
read
De
Quincey's
description
of
his
dreams
and
sensations,
he
had
drenched
his
tobacco
with
laudanum
in
an
attempt
to
produce
the
same
effects.
He
found,
as
so
many
more
have
done,
that
the
practice
is
easier
to
attain
than
to
get
rid
of,
and
for
many
years
he
continued
to
be
a
slave
to
the
drug,
an
object
of
mingled
horror
and
pity
to
his
friends
and
relatives.
I
can
see
him
now,
with
yellow,
pasty
face,
drooping
lids,
and
pin-point
pupils,
all
huddled
in
a
chair,
the
wreck
and
ruin
of
a
noble
man.
One
night--it
was
in
June,
'89--there
came
a
ring
to
my
bell,
about
the
hour
when
a
man
gives
his
first
yawn
and
glances
at
the
clock.
I
sat
up
in
my
chair,
and
my
wife
laid
her
needle-work
down
in
her
lap
and
made
a
little
face
of
disappointment.
"A
patient!"
said
she.
"You'll
have
to
go
out."
I
groaned,
for
I
was
newly
come
back
from
a
weary
day.
We
heard
the
door
open,
a
few
hurried
words,
and
then
quick
steps
upon
the
linoleum.
Our
own
door
flew
open,
and
a
lady,
clad
in
some
dark-coloured
stuff,
with
a
black
veil,
entered
the
room.
"You
will
excuse
my
calling
so
late,"
she
began,
and
then,
suddenly
losing
her
self-control,
she
ran
forward,
threw
her
arms
about
my
wife's
neck,
and
sobbed
upon
her
shoulder.
"Oh,
I'm
in
such
trouble!"
she
cried;
"I
do
so
want
a
little
help."
"Why,"
said
my
wife,
pulling
up
her
veil,
"it
is
Kate
Whitney.
How
you
startled
me,
Kate!
I
had
not
an
idea
who
you
were
when
you
came
in."
"I
didn't
know
what
to
do,
so
I
came
straight
to
you."
That
was
always
the
way.
Folk
who
were
in
grief
came
to
my
wife
like
birds
to
a
light-house.
"It
was
very
sweet
of
you
to
come.
Now,
you
must
have
some
wine
and
water,
and
sit
here
comfortably
and
tell
us
all
about
it.
Or
should
you
rather
that
I
sent
James
off
to
bed?"
"Oh,
no,
no!
I
want
the
doctor's
advice
and
help,
too.
It's
about
Isa.
He
has
not
been
home
for
two
days.
I
am
so
frightened
about
him!"
It
was
not
the
first
time
that
she
had
spoken
to
us
of
her
husband's
trouble,
to
me
as
a
doctor,
to
my
wife
as
an
old
friend
and
school
companion.
We
soothed
and
comforted
her
by
such
words
as
we
could
find.
Did
she
know
where
her
husband
was?
Was
it
possible
that
we
could
bring
him
back
to
her?
It
seems
that
it
was.
She
had
the
surest
information
that
of
late
he
had,
when
the
fit
was
on
him,
made
use
of
an
opium
den
in
the
farthest
east
of
the
City.
Hitherto
his
orgies
had
always
been
confined
to
one
day,
and
he
had
come
back,
twitching
and
shattered,
in
the
evening.
But
now
the
spell
had
been
upon
him
eight-and-forty
hours,
and
he
lay
there,
doubtless
among
the
dregs
of
the
docks,
breathing
in
the
poison
or
sleeping
off
the
effects.
There
he
was
to
be
found,
she
was
sure
of
it,
at
the
Bar
of
Gold,
in
Upper
Swandam
Lane.
But
what
was
she
to
do?
How
could
she,
a
young
and
timid
woman,
make
her
way
into
such
a
place
and
pluck
her
husband
out
from
among
the
ruffians
who
surrounded
him?
There
was
the
case,
and
of
course
there
was
but
one
way
out
of
it.
Might
I
not
escort
her
to
this
place?
And
then,
as
a
second
thought,
why
should
she
come
at
all?
I
was
Isa
Whitney's
medical
adviser,
and
as
such
I
had
influence
over
him.
I
could
manage
it
better
if
I
were
alone.
I
promised
her
on
my
word
that
I
would
send
him
home
in
a
cab
within
two
hours
if
he
were
indeed
at
the
address
which
she
had
given
me.
And
so
in
ten
minutes
I
had
left
my
armchair
and
cheery
sitting-room
behind
me,
and
was
speeding
eastward
in
a
hansom
on
a
strange
errand,
as
it
seemed
to
me
at
the
time,
though
the
future
only
could
show
how
strange
it
was
to
be.
But
there
was
no
great
difficulty
in
the
first
stage
of
my
adventure.
Upper
Swandam
Lane
is
a
vile
alley
lurking
behind
the
high
wharves
which
line
the
north
side
of
the
river
to
the
east
of
London
Bridge.
Between
a
slop-shop
and
a
gin-shop,
approached
by
a
steep
flight
of
steps
leading
down
to
a
black
gap
like
the
mouth
of
a
cave,
I
found
the
den
of
which
I
was
in
search.
Ordering
my
cab
to
wait,
I
passed
down
the
steps,
worn
hollow
in
the
centre
by
the
ceaseless
tread
of
drunken
feet;
and
by
the
light
of
a
flickering
oil-lamp
above
the
door
I
found
the
latch
and
made
my
way
into
a
long,
low
room,
thick
and
heavy
with
the
brown
opium
smoke,
and
terraced
with
wooden
berths,
like
the
forecastle
of
an
emigrant
ship.
Through
the
gloom
one
could
dimly
catch
a
glimpse
of
bodies
lying
in
strange
fantastic
poses,
bowed
shoulders,
bent
knees,
heads
thrown
back,
and
chins
pointing
upward,
with
here
and
there
a
dark,
lack-lustre
eye
turned
upon
the
newcomer.
Out
of
the
black
shadows
there
glimmered
little
red
circles
of
light,
now
bright,
now
faint,
as
the
burning
poison
waxed
or
waned
in
the
bowls
of
the
metal
pipes.
The
most
lay
silent,
but
some
muttered
to
themselves,
and
others
talked
together
in
a
strange,
low,
monotonous
voice,
their
conversation
coming
in
gushes,
and
then
suddenly
tailing
off
into
silence,
each
mumbling
out
his
own
thoughts
and
paying
little
heed
to
the
words
of
his
neighbour.
At
the
farther
end
was
a
small
brazier
of
burning
charcoal,
beside
which
on
a
three-legged
wooden
stool
there
sat
a
tall,
thin
old
man,
with
his
jaw
resting
upon
his
two
fists,
and
his
elbows
upon
his
knees,
staring
into
the
fire.
As
I
entered,
a
sallow
Malay
attendant
had
hurried
up
with
a
pipe
for
me
and
a
supply
of
the
drug,
beckoning
me
to
an
empty
berth.
"Thank
you.
I
have
not
come
to
stay,"
said
I.
"There
is
a
friend
of
mine
here,
Mr.
Isa
Whitney,
and
I
wish
to
speak
with
him."
There
was
a
movement
and
an
exclamation
from
my
right,
and
peering
through
the
gloom,
I
saw
Whitney,
pale,
haggard,
and
unkempt,
staring
out
at
me.
"My
God!
It's
Watson,"
said
he.
He
was
in
a
pitiable
state
of
reaction,
with
every
nerve
in
a
twitter.
"I
say,
Watson,
what
o'clock
is
it?"
"Nearly
eleven."
"Of
what
day?"
"Of
Friday,
June
19th."
"Good
heavens!
I
thought
it
was
Wednesday.
It
is
Wednesday.
What
d'you
want
to
frighten
a
chap
for?"
He
sank
his
face
onto
his
arms
and
began
to
sob
in
a
high
treble
key.
"I
tell
you
that
it
is
Friday,
man.
Your
wife
has
been
waiting
this
two
days
for
you.
You
should
be
ashamed
of
yourself!"
"So
I
am.
But
you've
got
mixed,
Watson,
for
I
have
only
been
here
a
few
hours,
three
pipes,
four
pipes--I
forget
how
many.
But
I'll
go
home
with
you.
I
wouldn't
frighten
Kate--poor
little
Kate.
Give
me
your
hand!
Have
you
a
cab?"
"Yes,
I
have
one
waiting."
"Then
I
shall
go
in
it.
But
I
must
owe
something.
Find
what
I
owe,
Watson.
I
am
all
off
colour.
I
can
do
nothing
for
myself."
I
walked
down
the
narrow
passage
between
the
double
row
of
sleepers,
holding
my
breath
to
keep
out
the
vile,
stupefying
fumes
of
the
drug,
and
looking
about
for
the
manager.
As
I
passed
the
tall
man
who
sat
by
the
brazier
I
felt
a
sudden
pluck
at
my
skirt,
and
a
low
voice
whispered,
"Walk
past
me,
and
then
look
back
at
me."
The
words
fell
quite
distinctly
upon
my
ear.
I
glanced
down.
They
could
only
have
come
from
the
old
man
at
my
side,
and
yet
he
sat
now
as
absorbed
as
ever,
very
thin,
very
wrinkled,
bent
with
age,
an
opium
pipe
dangling
down
from
between
his
knees,
as
though
it
had
dropped
in
sheer
lassitude
from
his
fingers.
I
took
two
steps
forward
and
looked
back.
It
took
all
my
self-control
to
prevent
me
from
breaking
out
into
a
cry
of
astonishment.
He
had
turned
his
back
so
that
none
could
see
him
but
I.
His
form
had
filled
out,
his
wrinkles
were
gone,
the
dull
eyes
had
regained
their
fire,
and
there,
sitting
by
the
fire
and
grinning
at
my
surprise,
was
none
other
than
Sherlock
Holmes.
He
made
a
slight
motion
to
me
to
approach
him,
and
instantly,
as
he
turned
his
face
half
round
to
the
company
once
more,
subsided
into
a
doddering,
loose-lipped
senility.
"Holmes!"
I
whispered,
"what
on
earth
are
you
doing
in
this
den?"
"As
low
as
you
can,"
he
answered;
"I
have
excellent
ears.
If
you
would
have
the
great
kindness
to
get
rid
of
that
sottish
friend
of
yours
I
should
be
exceedingly
glad
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you."
"I
have
a
cab
outside."
"Then
pray
send
him
home
in
it.
You
may
safely
trust
him,
for
he
appears
to
be
too
limp
to
get
into
any
mischief.
I
should
recommend
you
also
to
send
a
note
by
the
cabman
to
your
wife
to
say
that
you
have
thrown
in
your
lot
with
me.
If
you
will
wait
outside,
I
shall
be
with
you
in
five
minutes."
It
was
difficult
to
refuse
any
of
Sherlock
Holmes'
requests,
for
they
were
always
so
exceedingly
definite,
and
put
forward
with
such
a
quiet
air
of
mastery.
I
felt,
however,
that
when
Whitney
was
once
confined
in
the
cab
my
mission
was
practically
accomplished;
and
for
the
rest,
I
could
not
wish
anything
better
than
to
be
associated
with
my
friend
in
one
of
those
singular
adventures
which
were
the
normal
condition
of
his
existence.
In
a
few
minutes
I
had
written
my
note,
paid
Whitney's
bill,
led
him
out
to
the
cab,
and
seen
him
driven
through
the
darkness.
In
a
very
short
time
a
decrepit
figure
had
emerged
from
the
opium
den,
and
I
was
walking
down
the
street
with
Sherlock
Holmes.
For
two
streets
he
shuffled
along
with
a
bent
back
and
an
uncertain
foot.
Then,
glancing
quickly
round,
he
straightened
himself
out
and
burst
into
a
hearty
fit
of
laughter.
"I
suppose,
Watson,"
said
he,
"that
you
imagine
that
I
have
added
opium-smoking
to
cocaine
injections,
and
all
the
other
little
weaknesses
on
which
you
have
favoured
me
with
your
medical
views."
"I
was
certainly
surprised
to
find
you
there."
"But
not
more
so
than
I
to
find
you."
"I
came
to
find
a
friend."
"And
I
to
find
an
enemy."
"An
enemy?"
"Yes;
one
of
my
natural
enemies,
or,
shall
I
say,
my
natural
prey.
Briefly,
Watson,
I
am
in
the
midst
of
a
very
remarkable
inquiry,
and
I
have
hoped
to
find
a
clue
in
the
incoherent
ramblings
of
these
sots,
as
I
have
done
before
now.
Had
I
been
recognised
in
that
den
my
life
would
not
have
been
worth
an
hour's
purchase;
for
I
have
used
it
before
now
for
my
own
purposes,
and
the
rascally
Lascar
who
runs
it
has
sworn
to
have
vengeance
upon
me.
There
is
a
trap-door
at
the
back
of
that
building,
near
the
corner
of
Paul's
Wharf,
which
could
tell
some
strange
tales
of
what
has
passed
through
it
upon
the
moonless
nights."
"What!
You
do
not
mean
bodies?"
"Ay,
bodies,
Watson.
We
should
be
rich
men
if
we
had
1000
pounds
for
every
poor
devil
who
has
been
done
to
death
in
that
den.
It
is
the
vilest
murder-trap
on
the
whole
riverside,
and
I
fear
that
Neville
St.
Clair
has
entered
it
never
to
leave
it
more.
But
our
trap
should
be
here."
He
put
his
two
forefingers
between
his
teeth
and
whistled
shrilly--a
signal
which
was
answered
by
a
similar
whistle
from
the
distance,
followed
shortly
by
the
rattle
of
wheels
and
the
clink
of
horses'
hoofs.
"Now,
Watson,"
said
Holmes,
as
a
tall
dog-cart
dashed
up
through
the
gloom,
throwing
out
two
golden
tunnels
of
yellow
light
from
its
side
lanterns.
"You'll
come
with
me,
won't
you?"
"If
I
can
be
of
use."
"Oh,
a
trusty
comrade
is
always
of
use;
and
a
chronicler
still
more
so.
My
room
at
The
Cedars
is
a
double-bedded
one."
"The
Cedars?"
"Yes;
that
is
Mr.
St.
Clair's
house.
I
am
staying
there
while
I
conduct
the
inquiry."
"Where
is
it,
then?"
"Near
Lee,
in
Kent.
We
have
a
seven-mile
drive
before
us."
"But
I
am
all
in
the
dark."
"Of
course
you
are.
You'll
know
all
about
it
presently.
Jump
up
here.
All
right,
John;
we
shall
not
need
you.
Here's
half
a
crown.
Look
out
for
me
to-morrow,
about
eleven.
Give
her
her
head.
So
long,
then!"
He
flicked
the
horse
with
his
whip,
and
we
dashed
away
through
the
endless
succession
of
sombre
and
deserted
streets,
which
widened
gradually,
until
we
were
flying
across
a
broad
balustraded
bridge,
with
the
murky
river
flowing
sluggishly
beneath
us.
Beyond
lay
another
dull
wilderness
of
bricks
and
mortar,
its
silence
broken
only
by
the
heavy,
regular
footfall
of
the
policeman,
or
the
songs
and
shouts
of
some
belated
party
of
revellers.
A
dull
wrack
was
drifting
slowly
across
the
sky,
and
a
star
or
two
twinkled
dimly
here
and
there
through
the
rifts
of
the
clouds.
Holmes
drove
in
silence,
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
breast,
and
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
lost
in
thought,
while
I
sat
beside
him,
curious
to
learn
what
this
new
quest
might
be
which
seemed
to
tax
his
powers
so
sorely,
and
yet
afraid
to
break
in
upon
the
current
of
his
thoughts.
We
had
driven
several
miles,
and
were
beginning
to
get
to
the
fringe
of
the
belt
of
suburban
villas,
when
he
shook
himself,
shrugged
his
shoulders,
and
lit
up
his
pipe
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
satisfied
himself
that
he
is
acting
for
the
best.
"You
have
a
grand
gift
of
silence,
Watson,"
said
he.
"It
makes
you
quite
invaluable
as
a
companion.
'Pon
my
word,
it
is
a
great
thing
for
me
to
have
someone
to
talk
to,
for
my
own
thoughts
are
not
over-pleasant.
I
was
wondering
what
I
should
say
to
this
dear
little
woman
to-night
when
she
meets
me
at
the
door."
"You
forget
that
I
know
nothing
about
it."
"I
shall
just
have
time
to
tell
you
the
facts
of
the
case
before
we
get
to
Lee.
It
seems
absurdly
simple,
and
yet,
somehow
I
can
get
nothing
to
go
upon.
There's
plenty
of
thread,
no
doubt,
but
I
can't
get
the
end
of
it
into
my
hand.
Now,
I'll
state
the
case
clearly
and
concisely
to
you,
Watson,
and
maybe
you
can
see
a
spark
where
all
is
dark
to
me."
"Proceed,
then."
"Some
years
ago--to
be
definite,
in
May,
1884--there
came
to
Lee
a
gentleman,
Neville
St.
Clair
by
name,
who
appeared
to
have
plenty
of
money.
He
took
a
large
villa,
laid
out
the
grounds
very
nicely,
and
lived
generally
in
good
style.
By
degrees
he
made
friends
in
the
neighbourhood,
and
in
1887
he
married
the
daughter
of
a
local
brewer,
by
whom
he
now
has
two
children.
He
had
no
occupation,
but
was
interested
in
several
companies
and
went
into
town
as
a
rule
in
the
morning,
returning
by
the
5:14
from
Cannon
Street
every
night.
Mr.
St.
Clair
is
now
thirty-seven
years
of
age,
is
a
man
of
temperate
habits,
a
good
husband,
a
very
affectionate
father,
and
a
man
who
is
popular
with
all
who
know
him.
I
may
add
that
his
whole
debts
at
the
present
moment,
as
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
ascertain,
amount
to
88
pounds
10s.,
while
he
has
220
pounds
standing
to
his
credit
in
the
Capital
and
Counties
Bank.
There
is
no
reason,
therefore,
to
think
that
money
troubles
have
been
weighing
upon
his
mind.
"Last
Monday
Mr.
Neville
St.
Clair
went
into
town
rather
earlier
than
usual,
remarking
before
he
started
that
he
had
two
important
commissions
to
perform,
and
that
he
would
bring
his
little
boy
home
a
box
of
bricks.
Now,
by
the
merest
chance,
his
wife
received
a
telegram
upon
this
same
Monday,
very
shortly
after
his
departure,
to
the
effect
that
a
small
parcel
of
considerable
value
which
she
had
been
expecting
was
waiting
for
her
at
the
offices
of
the
Aberdeen
Shipping
Company.
Now,
if
you
are
well
up
in
your
London,
you
will
know
that
the
office
of
the
company
is
in
Fresno
Street,
which
branches
out
of
Upper
Swandam
Lane,
where
you
found
me
to-night.
Mrs.
St.
Clair
had
her
lunch,
started
for
the
City,
did
some
shopping,
proceeded
to
the
company's
office,
got
her
packet,
and
found
herself
at
exactly
4:35
walking
through
Swandam
Lane
on
her
way
back
to
the
station.
Have
you
followed
me
so
far?"
"It
is
very
clear."
"If
you
remember,
Monday
was
an
exceedingly
hot
day,
and
Mrs.
St.
Clair
walked
slowly,
glancing
about
in
the
hope
of
seeing
a
cab,
as
she
did
not
like
the
neighbourhood
in
which
she
found
herself.
While
she
was
walking
in
this
way
down
Swandam
Lane,
she
suddenly
heard
an
ejaculation
or
cry,
and
was
struck
cold
to
see
her
husband
looking
down
at
her
and,
as
it
seemed
to
her,
beckoning
to
her
from
a
second-floor
window.
The
window
was
open,
and
she
distinctly
saw
his
face,
which
she
describes
as
being
terribly
agitated.
He
waved
his
hands
frantically
to
her,
and
then
vanished
from
the
window
so
suddenly
that
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
had
been
plucked
back
by
some
irresistible
force
from
behind.
One
singular
point
which
struck
her
quick
feminine
eye
was
that
although
he
wore
some
dark
coat,
such
as
he
had
started
to
town
in,
he
had
on
neither
collar
nor
necktie.
"Convinced
that
something
was
amiss
with
him,
she
rushed
down
the
steps--for
the
house
was
none
other
than
the
opium
den
in
which
you
found
me
to-night--and
running
through
the
front
room
she
attempted
to
ascend
the
stairs
which
led
to
the
first
floor.
At
the
foot
of
the
stairs,
however,
she
met
this
Lascar
scoundrel
of
whom
I
have
spoken,
who
thrust
her
back
and,
aided
by
a
Dane,
who
acts
as
assistant
there,
pushed
her
out
into
the
street.
Filled
with
the
most
maddening
doubts
and
fears,
she
rushed
down
the
lane
and,
by
rare
good-fortune,
met
in
Fresno
Street
a
number
of
constables
with
an
inspector,
all
on
their
way
to
their
beat.
The
inspector
and
two
men
accompanied
her
back,
and
in
spite
of
the
continued
resistance
of
the
proprietor,
they
made
their
way
to
the
room
in
which
Mr.
St.
Clair
had
last
been
seen.
There
was
no
sign
of
him
there.
In
fact,
in
the
whole
of
that
floor
there
was
no
one
to
be
found
save
a
crippled
wretch
of
hideous
aspect,
who,
it
seems,
made
his
home
there.
Both
he
and
the
Lascar
stoutly
swore
that
no
one
else
had
been
in
the
front
room
during
the
afternoon.
So
determined
was
their
denial
that
the
inspector
was
staggered,
and
had
almost
come
to
believe
that
Mrs.
St.
Clair
had
been
deluded
when,
with
a
cry,
she
sprang
at
a
small
deal
box
which
lay
upon
the
table
and
tore
the
lid
from
it.
Out
there
fell
a
cascade
of
children's
bricks.
It
was
the
toy
which
he
had
promised
to
bring
home.
"This
discovery,
and
the
evident
confusion
which
the
cripple
showed,
made
the
inspector
realise
that
the
matter
was
serious.
The
rooms
were
carefully
examined,
and
results
all
pointed
to
an
abominable
crime.
The
front
room
was
plainly
furnished
as
a
sitting-room
and
led
into
a
small
bedroom,
which
looked
out
upon
the
back
of
one
of
the
wharves.
Between
the
wharf
and
the
bedroom
window
is
a
narrow
strip,
which
is
dry
at
low
tide
but
is
covered
at
high
tide
with
at
least
four
and
a
half
feet
of
water.
The
bedroom
window
was
a
broad
one
and
opened
from
below.
On
examination
traces
of
blood
were
to
be
seen
upon
the
windowsill,
and
several
scattered
drops
were
visible
upon
the
wooden
floor
of
the
bedroom.
Thrust
away
behind
a
curtain
in
the
front
room
were
all
the
clothes
of
Mr.
Neville
St.
Clair,
with
the
exception
of
his
coat.
His
boots,
his
socks,
his
hat,
and
his
watch--all
were
there.
There
were
no
signs
of
violence
upon
any
of
these
garments,
and
there
were
no
other
traces
of
Mr.
Neville
St.
Clair.
Out
of
the
window
he
must
apparently
have
gone
for
no
other
exit
could
be
discovered,
and
the
ominous
bloodstains
upon
the
sill
gave
little
promise
that
he
could
save
himself
by
swimming,
for
the
tide
was
at
its
very
highest
at
the
moment
of
the
tragedy.
"And
now
as
to
the
villains
who
seemed
to
be
immediately
implicated
in
the
matter.
The
Lascar
was
known
to
be
a
man
of
the
vilest
antecedents,
but
as,
by
Mrs.
St.
Clair's
story,
he
was
known
to
have
been
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
within
a
very
few
seconds
of
her
husband's
appearance
at
the
window,
he
could
hardly
have
been
more
than
an
accessory
to
the
crime.
His
defence
was
one
of
absolute
ignorance,
and
he
protested
that
he
had
no
knowledge
as
to
the
doings
of
Hugh
Boone,
his
lodger,
and
that
he
could
not
account
in
any
way
for
the
presence
of
the
missing
gentleman's
clothes.
"So
much
for
the
Lascar
manager.
Now
for
the
sinister
cripple
who
lives
upon
the
second
floor
of
the
opium
den,
and
who
was
certainly
the
last
human
being
whose
eyes
rested
upon
Neville
St.
Clair.
His
name
is
Hugh
Boone,
and
his
hideous
face
is
one
which
is
familiar
to
every
man
who
goes
much
to
the
City.
He
is
a
professional
beggar,
though
in
order
to
avoid
the
police
regulations
he
pretends
to
a
small
trade
in
wax
vestas.
Some
little
distance
down
Threadneedle
Street,
upon
the
left-hand
side,
there
is,
as
you
may
have
remarked,
a
small
angle
in
the
wall.
Here
it
is
that
this
creature
takes
his
daily
seat,
cross-legged
with
his
tiny
stock
of
matches
on
his
lap,
and
as
he
is
a
piteous
spectacle
a
small
rain
of
charity
descends
into
the
greasy
leather
cap
which
lies
upon
the
pavement
beside
him.
I
have
watched
the
fellow
more
than
once
before
ever
I
thought
of
making
his
professional
acquaintance,
and
I
have
been
surprised
at
the
harvest
which
he
has
reaped
in
a
short
time.
His
appearance,
you
see,
is
so
remarkable
that
no
one
can
pass
him
without
observing
him.
A
shock
of
orange
hair,
a
pale
face
disfigured
by
a
horrible
scar,
which,
by
its
contraction,
has
turned
up
the
outer
edge
of
his
upper
lip,
a
bulldog
chin,
and
a
pair
of
very
penetrating
dark
eyes,
which
present
a
singular
contrast
to
the
colour
of
his
hair,
all
mark
him
out
from
amid
the
common
crowd
of
mendicants
and
so,
too,
does
his
wit,
for
he
is
ever
ready
with
a
reply
to
any
piece
of
chaff
which
may
be
thrown
at
him
by
the
passers-by.
This
is
the
man
whom
we
now
learn
to
have
been
the
lodger
at
the
opium
den,
and
to
have
been
the
last
man
to
see
the
gentleman
of
whom
we
are
in
quest."
"But
a
cripple!"
said
I.
"What
could
he
have
done
single-handed
against
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life?"
"He
is
a
cripple
in
the
sense
that
he
walks
with
a
limp;
but
in
other
respects
he
appears
to
be
a
powerful
and
well-nurtured
man.
Surely
your
medical
experience
would
tell
you,
Watson,
that
weakness
in
one
limb
is
often
compensated
for
by
exceptional
strength
in
the
others."
"Pray
continue
your
narrative."
"Mrs.
St.
Clair
had
fainted
at
the
sight
of
the
blood
upon
the
window,
and
she
was
escorted
home
in
a
cab
by
the
police,
as
her
presence
could
be
of
no
help
to
them
in
their
investigations.
Inspector
Barton,
who
had
charge
of
the
case,
made
a
very
careful
examination
of
the
premises,
but
without
finding
anything
which
threw
any
light
upon
the
matter.
One
mistake
had
been
made
in
not
arresting
Boone
instantly,
as
he
was
allowed
some
few
minutes
during
which
he
might
have
communicated
with
his
friend
the
Lascar,
but
this
fault
was
soon
remedied,
and
he
was
seized
and
searched,
without
anything
being
found
which
could
incriminate
him.
There
were,
it
is
true,
some
blood-stains
upon
his
right
shirt-sleeve,
but
he
pointed
to
his
ring-finger,
which
had
been
cut
near
the
nail,
and
explained
that
the
bleeding
came
from
there,
adding
that
he
had
been
to
the
window
not
long
before,
and
that
the
stains
which
had
been
observed
there
came
doubtless
from
the
same
source.
He
denied
strenuously
having
ever
seen
Mr.
Neville
St.
Clair
and
swore
that
the
presence
of
the
clothes
in
his
room
was
as
much
a
mystery
to
him
as
to
the
police.
As
to
Mrs.
St.
Clair's
assertion
that
she
had
actually
seen
her
husband
at
the
window,
he
declared
that
she
must
have
been
either
mad
or
dreaming.
He
was
removed,
loudly
protesting,
to
the
police-station,
while
the
inspector
remained
upon
the
premises
in
the
hope
that
the
ebbing
tide
might
afford
some
fresh
clue.
"And
it
did,
though
they
hardly
found
upon
the
mud-bank
what
they
had
feared
to
find.
It
was
Neville
St.
Clair's
coat,
and
not
Neville
St.
Clair,
which
lay
uncovered
as
the
tide
receded.
And
what
do
you
think
they
found
in
the
pockets?"
"I
cannot
imagine."
"No,
I
don't
think
you
would
guess.
Every
pocket
stuffed
with
pennies
and
half-pennies--421
pennies
and
270
half-pennies.
It
was
no
wonder
that
it
had
not
been
swept
away
by
the
tide.
But
a
human
body
is
a
different
matter.
There
is
a
fierce
eddy
between
the
wharf
and
the
house.
It
seemed
likely
enough
that
the
weighted
coat
had
remained
when
the
stripped
body
had
been
sucked
away
into
the
river."
"But
I
understand
that
all
the
other
clothes
were
found
in
the
room.
Would
the
body
be
dressed
in
a
coat
alone?"
"No,
sir,
but
the
facts
might
be
met
speciously
enough.
Suppose
that
this
man
Boone
had
thrust
Neville
St.
Clair
through
the
window,
there
is
no
human
eye
which
could
have
seen
the
deed.
What
would
he
do
then?
It
would
of
course
instantly
strike
him
that
he
must
get
rid
of
the
tell-tale
garments.
He
would
seize
the
coat,
then,
and
be
in
the
act
of
throwing
it
out,
when
it
would
occur
to
him
that
it
would
swim
and
not
sink.
He
has
little
time,
for
he
has
heard
the
scuffle
downstairs
when
the
wife
tried
to
force
her
way
up,
and
perhaps
he
has
already
heard
from
his
Lascar
confederate
that
the
police
are
hurrying
up
the
street.
There
is
not
an
instant
to
be
lost.
He
rushes
to
some
secret
hoard,
where
he
has
accumulated
the
fruits
of
his
beggary,
and
he
stuffs
all
the
coins
upon
which
he
can
lay
his
hands
into
the
pockets
to
make
sure
of
the
coat's
sinking.
He
throws
it
out,
and
would
have
done
the
same
with
the
other
garments
had
not
he
heard
the
rush
of
steps
below,
and
only
just
had
time
to
close
the
window
when
the
police
appeared."
"It
certainly
sounds
feasible."
"Well,
we
will
take
it
as
a
working
hypothesis
for
want
of
a
better.
Boone,
as
I
have
told
you,
was
arrested
and
taken
to
the
station,
but
it
could
not
be
shown
that
there
had
ever
before
been
anything
against
him.
He
had
for
years
been
known
as
a
professional
beggar,
but
his
life
appeared
to
have
been
a
very
quiet
and
innocent
one.
There
the
matter
stands
at
present,
and
the
questions
which
have
to
be
solved--what
Neville
St.
Clair
was
doing
in
the
opium
den,
what
happened
to
him
when
there,
where
is
he
now,
and
what
Hugh
Boone
had
to
do
with
his
disappearance--are
all
as
far
from
a
solution
as
ever.
I
confess
that
I
cannot
recall
any
case
within
my
experience
which
looked
at
the
first
glance
so
simple
and
yet
which
presented
such
difficulties."
While
Sherlock
Holmes
had
been
detailing
this
singular
series
of
events,
we
had
been
whirling
through
the
outskirts
of
the
great
town
until
the
last
straggling
houses
had
been
left
behind,
and
we
rattled
along
with
a
country
hedge
upon
either
side
of
us.
Just
as
he
finished,
however,
we
drove
through
two
scattered
villages,
where
a
few
lights
still
glimmered
in
the
windows.
"We
are
on
the
outskirts
of
Lee,"
said
my
companion.
"We
have
touched
on
three
English
counties
in
our
short
drive,
starting
in
Middlesex,
passing
over
an
angle
of
Surrey,
and
ending
in
Kent.
See
that
light
among
the
trees?
That
is
The
Cedars,
and
beside
that
lamp
sits
a
woman
whose
anxious
ears
have
already,
I
have
little
doubt,
caught
the
clink
of
our
horse's
feet."
"But
why
are
you
not
conducting
the
case
from
Baker
Street?"
I
asked.
"Because
there
are
many
inquiries
which
must
be
made
out
here.
Mrs.
St.
Clair
has
most
kindly
put
two
rooms
at
my
disposal,
and
you
may
rest
assured
that
she
will
have
nothing
but
a
welcome
for
my
friend
and
colleague.
I
hate
to
meet
her,
Watson,
when
I
have
no
news
of
her
husband.
Here
we
are.
Whoa,
there,
whoa!"
We
had
pulled
up
in
front
of
a
large
villa
which
stood
within
its
own
grounds.
A
stable-boy
had
run
out
to
the
horse's
head,
and
springing
down,
I
followed
Holmes
up
the
small,
winding
gravel-drive
which
led
to
the
house.
As
we
approached,
the
door
flew
open,
and
a
little
blonde
woman
stood
in
the
opening,
clad
in
some
sort
of
light
mousseline
de
soie,
with
a
touch
of
fluffy
pink
chiffon
at
her
neck
and
wrists.
She
stood
with
her
figure
outlined
against
the
flood
of
light,
one
hand
upon
the
door,
one
half-raised
in
her
eagerness,
her
body
slightly
bent,
her
head
and
face
protruded,
with
eager
eyes
and
parted
lips,
a
standing
question.
"Well?"
she
cried,
"well?"
And
then,
seeing
that
there
were
two
of
us,
she
gave
a
cry
of
hope
which
sank
into
a
groan
as
she
saw
that
my
companion
shook
his
head
and
shrugged
his
shoulders.
"No
good
news?"
"None."
"No
bad?"
"No."
"Thank
God
for
that.
But
come
in.
You
must
be
weary,
for
you
have
had
a
long
day."
"This
is
my
friend,
Dr.
Watson.
He
has
been
of
most
vital
use
to
me
in
several
of
my
cases,
and
a
lucky
chance
has
made
it
possible
for
me
to
bring
him
out
and
associate
him
with
this
investigation."
"I
am
delighted
to
see
you,"
said
she,
pressing
my
hand
warmly.
"You
will,
I
am
sure,
forgive
anything
that
may
be
wanting
in
our
arrangements,
when
you
consider
the
blow
which
has
come
so
suddenly
upon
us."
"My
dear
madam,"
said
I,
"I
am
an
old
campaigner,
and
if
I
were
not
I
can
very
well
see
that
no
apology
is
needed.
If
I
can
be
of
any
assistance,
either
to
you
or
to
my
friend
here,
I
shall
be
indeed
happy."
"Now,
Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes,"
said
the
lady
as
we
entered
a
well-lit
dining-room,
upon
the
table
of
which
a
cold
supper
had
been
laid
out,
"I
should
very
much
like
to
ask
you
one
or
two
plain
questions,
to
which
I
beg
that
you
will
give
a
plain
answer."
"Certainly,
madam."
"Do
not
trouble
about
my
feelings.
I
am
not
hysterical,
nor
given
to
fainting.
I
simply
wish
to
hear
your
real,
real
opinion."
"Upon
what
point?"
"In
your
heart
of
hearts,
do
you
think
that
Neville
is
alive?"
Sherlock
Holmes
seemed
to
be
embarrassed
by
the
question.
"Frankly,
now!"
she
repeated,
standing
upon
the
rug
and
looking
keenly
down
at
him
as
he
leaned
back
in
a
basket-chair.
"Frankly,
then,
madam,
I
do
not."
"You
think
that
he
is
dead?"
"I
do."
"Murdered?"
"I
don't
say
that.
Perhaps."
"And
on
what
day
did
he
meet
his
death?"
"On
Monday."
"Then
perhaps,
Mr.
Holmes,
you
will
be
good
enough
to
explain
how
it
is
that
I
have
received
a
letter
from
him
to-day."
Sherlock
Holmes
sprang
out
of
his
chair
as
if
he
had
been
galvanised.
"What!"
he
roared.
"Yes,
to-day."
She
stood
smiling,
holding
up
a
little
slip
of
paper
in
the
air.
"May
I
see
it?"
"Certainly."
He
snatched
it
from
her
in
his
eagerness,
and
smoothing
it
out
upon
the
table
he
drew
over
the
lamp
and
examined
it
intently.
I
had
left
my
chair
and
was
gazing
at
it
over
his
shoulder.
The
envelope
was
a
very
coarse
one
and
was
stamped
with
the
Gravesend
postmark
and
with
the
date
of
that
very
day,
or
rather
of
the
day
before,
for
it
was
considerably
after
midnight.
"Coarse
writing,"
murmured
Holmes.
"Surely
this
is
not
your
husband's
writing,
madam."
"No,
but
the
enclosure
is."
"I
perceive
also
that
whoever
addressed
the
envelope
had
to
go
and
inquire
as
to
the
address."
"How
can
you
tell
that?"
"The
name,
you
see,
is
in
perfectly
black
ink,
which
has
dried
itself.
The
rest
is
of
the
greyish
colour,
which
shows
that
blotting-paper
has
been
used.
If
it
had
been
written
straight
off,
and
then
blotted,
none
would
be
of
a
deep
black
shade.
This
man
has
written
the
name,
and
there
has
then
been
a
pause
before
he
wrote
the
address,
which
can
only
mean
that
he
was
not
familiar
with
it.
It
is,
of
course,
a
trifle,
but
there
is
nothing
so
important
as
trifles.
Let
us
now
see
the
letter.
Ha!
there
has
been
an
enclosure
here!"
"Yes,
there
was
a
ring.
His
signet-ring."
"And
you
are
sure
that
this
is
your
husband's
hand?"
"One
of
his
hands."
"One?"
"His
hand
when
he
wrote
hurriedly.
It
is
very
unlike
his
usual
writing,
and
yet
I
know
it
well."
"'Dearest
do
not
be
frightened.
All
will
come
well.
There
is
a
huge
error
which
it
may
take
some
little
time
to
rectify.
Wait
in
patience.--NEVILLE.'
Written
in
pencil
upon
the
fly-leaf
of
a
book,
octavo
size,
no
water-mark.
Hum!
Posted
to-day
in
Gravesend
by
a
man
with
a
dirty
thumb.
Ha!
And
the
flap
has
been
gummed,
if
I
am
not
very
much
in
error,
by
a
person
who
had
been
chewing
tobacco.
And
you
have
no
doubt
that
it
is
your
husband's
hand,
madam?"
"None.
Neville
wrote
those
words."
"And
they
were
posted
to-day
at
Gravesend.
Well,
Mrs.
St.
Clair,
the
clouds
lighten,
though
I
should
not
venture
to
say
that
the
danger
is
over."
"But
he
must
be
alive,
Mr.
Holmes."
"Unless
this
is
a
clever
forgery
to
put
us
on
the
wrong
scent.
The
ring,
after
all,
proves
nothing.
It
may
have
been
taken
from
him."
"No,
no;
it
is,
it
is
his
very
own
writing!"
"Very
well.
It
may,
however,
have
been
written
on
Monday
and
only
posted
to-day."
"That
is
possible."
"If
so,
much
may
have
happened
between."
"Oh,
you
must
not
discourage
me,
Mr.
Holmes.
I
know
that
all
is
well
with
him.
There
is
so
keen
a
sympathy
between
us
that
I
should
know
if
evil
came
upon
him.
On
the
very
day
that
I
saw
him
last
he
cut
himself
in
the
bedroom,
and
yet
I
in
the
dining-room
rushed
upstairs
instantly
with
the
utmost
certainty
that
something
had
happened.
Do
you
think
that
I
would
respond
to
such
a
trifle
and
yet
be
ignorant
of
his
death?"
"I
have
seen
too
much
not
to
know
that
the
impression
of
a
woman
may
be
more
valuable
than
the
conclusion
of
an
analytical
reasoner.
And
in
this
letter
you
certainly
have
a
very
strong
piece
of
evidence
to
corroborate
your
view.
But
if
your
husband
is
alive
and
able
to
write
letters,
why
should
he
remain
away
from
you?"
"I
cannot
imagine.
It
is
unthinkable."
"And
on
Monday
he
made
no
remarks
before
leaving
you?"
"No."
"And
you
were
surprised
to
see
him
in
Swandam
Lane?"
"Very
much
so."
"Was
the
window
open?"
"Yes."
"Then
he
might
have
called
to
you?"
"He
might."
"He
only,
as
I
understand,
gave
an
inarticulate
cry?"
"Yes."
"A
call
for
help,
you
thought?"
"Yes.
He
waved
his
hands."
"But
it
might
have
been
a
cry
of
surprise.
Astonishment
at
the
unexpected
sight
of
you
might
cause
him
to
throw
up
his
hands?"
"It
is
possible."
"And
you
thought
he
was
pulled
back?"
"He
disappeared
so
suddenly."
"He
might
have
leaped
back.
You
did
not
see
anyone
else
in
the
room?"
"No,
but
this
horrible
man
confessed
to
having
been
there,
and
the
Lascar
was
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs."
"Quite
so.
Your
husband,
as
far
as
you
could
see,
had
his
ordinary
clothes
on?"
"But
without
his
collar
or
tie.
I
distinctly
saw
his
bare
throat."
"Had
he
ever
spoken
of
Swandam
Lane?"
"Never."
"Had
he
ever
showed
any
signs
of
having
taken
opium?"
"Never."
"Thank
you,
Mrs.
St.
Clair.
Those
are
the
principal
points
about
which
I
wished
to
be
absolutely
clear.
We
shall
now
have
a
little
supper
and
then
retire,
for
we
may
have
a
very
busy
day
to-morrow."
A
large
and
comfortable
double-bedded
room
had
been
placed
at
our
disposal,
and
I
was
quickly
between
the
sheets,
for
I
was
weary
after
my
night
of
adventure.
Sherlock
Holmes
was
a
man,
however,
who,
when
he
had
an
unsolved
problem
upon
his
mind,
would
go
for
days,
and
even
for
a
week,
without
rest,
turning
it
over,
rearranging
his
facts,
looking
at
it
from
every
point
of
view
until
he
had
either
fathomed
it
or
convinced
himself
that
his
data
were
insufficient.
It
was
soon
evident
to
me
that
he
was
now
preparing
for
an
all-night
sitting.
He
took
off
his
coat
and
waistcoat,
put
on
a
large
blue
dressing-gown,
and
then
wandered
about
the
room
collecting
pillows
from
his
bed
and
cushions
from
the
sofa
and
armchairs.
With
these
he
constructed
a
sort
of
Eastern
divan,
upon
which
he
perched
himself
cross-legged,
with
an
ounce
of
shag
tobacco
and
a
box
of
matches
laid
out
in
front
of
him.
In
the
dim
light
of
the
lamp
I
saw
him
sitting
there,
an
old
briar
pipe
between
his
lips,
his
eyes
fixed
vacantly
upon
the
corner
of
the
ceiling,
the
blue
smoke
curling
up
from
him,
silent,
motionless,
with
the
light
shining
upon
his
strong-set
aquiline
features.
So
he
sat
as
I
dropped
off
to
sleep,
and
so
he
sat
when
a
sudden
ejaculation
caused
me
to
wake
up,
and
I
found
the
summer
sun
shining
into
the
apartment.
The
pipe
was
still
between
his
lips,
the
smoke
still
curled
upward,
and
the
room
was
full
of
a
dense
tobacco
haze,
but
nothing
remained
of
the
heap
of
shag
which
I
had
seen
upon
the
previous
night.
"Awake,
Watson?"
he
asked.
"Yes."
"Game
for
a
morning
drive?"
"Certainly."
"Then
dress.
No
one
is
stirring
yet,
but
I
know
where
the
stable-boy
sleeps,
and
we
shall
soon
have
the
trap
out."
He
chuckled
to
himself
as
he
spoke,
his
eyes
twinkled,
and
he
seemed
a
different
man
to
the
sombre
thinker
of
the
previous
night.
As
I
dressed
I
glanced
at
my
watch.
It
was
no
wonder
that
no
one
was
stirring.
It
was
twenty-five
minutes
past
four.
I
had
hardly
finished
when
Holmes
returned
with
the
news
that
the
boy
was
putting
in
the
horse.
"I
want
to
test
a
little
theory
of
mine,"
said
he,
pulling
on
his
boots.
"I
think,
Watson,
that
you
are
now
standing
in
the
presence
of
one
of
the
most
absolute
fools
in
Europe.
I
deserve
to
be
kicked
from
here
to
Charing
Cross.
But
I
think
I
have
the
key
of
the
affair
now."
"And
where
is
it?"
I
asked,
smiling.
"In
the
bathroom,"
he
answered.
"Oh,
yes,
I
am
not
joking,"
he
continued,
seeing
my
look
of
incredulity.
"I
have
just
been
there,
and
I
have
taken
it
out,
and
I
have
got
it
in
this
Gladstone
bag.
Come
on,
my
boy,
and
we
shall
see
whether
it
will
not
fit
the
lock."
We
made
our
way
downstairs
as
quietly
as
possible,
and
out
into
the
bright
morning
sunshine.
In
the
road
stood
our
horse
and
trap,
with
the
half-clad
stable-boy
waiting
at
the
head.
We
both
sprang
in,
and
away
we
dashed
down
the
London
Road.
A
few
country
carts
were
stirring,
bearing
in
vegetables
to
the
metropolis,
but
the
lines
of
villas
on
either
side
were
as
silent
and
lifeless
as
some
city
in
a
dream.
"It
has
been
in
some
points
a
singular
case,"
said
Holmes,
flicking
the
horse
on
into
a
gallop.
"I
confess
that
I
have
been
as
blind
as
a
mole,
but
it
is
better
to
learn
wisdom
late
than
never
to
learn
it
at
all."
In
town
the
earliest
risers
were
just
beginning
to
look
sleepily
from
their
windows
as
we
drove
through
the
streets
of
the
Surrey
side.
Passing
down
the
Waterloo
Bridge
Road
we
crossed
over
the
river,
and
dashing
up
Wellington
Street
wheeled
sharply
to
the
right
and
found
ourselves
in
Bow
Street.
Sherlock
Holmes
was
well
known
to
the
force,
and
the
two
constables
at
the
door
saluted
him.
One
of
them
held
the
horse's
head
while
the
other
led
us
in.
"Who
is
on
duty?"
asked
Holmes.
"Inspector
Bradstreet,
sir."
"Ah,
Bradstreet,
how
are
you?"
A
tall,
stout
official
had
come
down
the
stone-flagged
passage,
in
a
peaked
cap
and
frogged
jacket.
"I
wish
to
have
a
quiet
word
with
you,
Bradstreet."
"Certainly,
Mr.
Holmes.
Step
into
my
room
here."
It
was
a
small,
office-like
room,
with
a
huge
ledger
upon
the
table,
and
a
telephone
projecting
from
the
wall.
The
inspector
sat
down
at
his
desk.
"What
can
I
do
for
you,
Mr.
Holmes?"
"I
called
about
that
beggarman,
Boone--the
one
who
was
charged
with
being
concerned
in
the
disappearance
of
Mr.
Neville
St.
Clair,
of
Lee."
"Yes.
He
was
brought
up
and
remanded
for
further
inquiries."
"So
I
heard.
You
have
him
here?"
"In
the
cells."
"Is
he
quiet?"
"Oh,
he
gives
no
trouble.
But
he
is
a
dirty
scoundrel."
"Dirty?"
"Yes,
it
is
all
we
can
do
to
make
him
wash
his
hands,
and
his
face
is
as
black
as
a
tinker's.
Well,
when
once
his
case
has
been
settled,
he
will
have
a
regular
prison
bath;
and
I
think,
if
you
saw
him,
you
would
agree
with
me
that
he
needed
it."
"I
should
like
to
see
him
very
much."
"Would
you?
That
is
easily
done.
Come
this
way.
You
can
leave
your
bag."
"No,
I
think
that
I'll
take
it."
"Very
good.
Come
this
way,
if
you
please."
He
led
us
down
a
passage,
opened
a
barred
door,
passed
down
a
winding
stair,
and
brought
us
to
a
whitewashed
corridor
with
a
line
of
doors
on
each
side.
"The
third
on
the
right
is
his,"
said
the
inspector.
"Here
it
is!"
He
quietly
shot
back
a
panel
in
the
upper
part
of
the
door
and
glanced
through.
"He
is
asleep,"
said
he.
"You
can
see
him
very
well."
We
both
put
our
eyes
to
the
grating.
The
prisoner
lay
with
his
face
towards
us,
in
a
very
deep
sleep,
breathing
slowly
and
heavily.
He
was
a
middle-sized
man,
coarsely
clad
as
became
his
calling,
with
a
coloured
shirt
protruding
through
the
rent
in
his
tattered
coat.
He
was,
as
the
inspector
had
said,
extremely
dirty,
but
the
grime
which
covered
his
face
could
not
conceal
its
repulsive
ugliness.
A
broad
wheal
from
an
old
scar
ran
right
across
it
from
eye
to
chin,
and
by
its
contraction
had
turned
up
one
side
of
the
upper
lip,
so
that
three
teeth
were
exposed
in
a
perpetual
snarl.
A
shock
of
very
bright
red
hair
grew
low
over
his
eyes
and
forehead.
"He's
a
beauty,
isn't
he?"
said
the
inspector.
"He
certainly
needs
a
wash,"
remarked
Holmes.
"I
had
an
idea
that
he
might,
and
I
took
the
liberty
of
bringing
the
tools
with
me."
He
opened
the
Gladstone
bag
as
he
spoke,
and
took
out,
to
my
astonishment,
a
very
large
bath-sponge.
"He!
he!
You
are
a
funny
one,"
chuckled
the
inspector.
"Now,
if
you
will
have
the
great
goodness
to
open
that
door
very
quietly,
we
will
soon
make
him
cut
a
much
more
respectable
figure."
"Well,
I
don't
know
why
not,"
said
the
inspector.
"He
doesn't
look
a
credit
to
the
Bow
Street
cells,
does
he?"
He
slipped
his
key
into
the
lock,
and
we
all
very
quietly
entered
the
cell.
The
sleeper
half
turned,
and
then
settled
down
once
more
into
a
deep
slumber.
Holmes
stooped
to
the
water-jug,
moistened
his
sponge,
and
then
rubbed
it
twice
vigorously
across
and
down
the
prisoner's
face.
"Let
me
introduce
you,"
he
shouted,
"to
Mr.
Neville
St.
Clair,
of
Lee,
in
the
county
of
Kent."
Never
in
my
life
have
I
seen
such
a
sight.
The
man's
face
peeled
off
under
the
sponge
like
the
bark
from
a
tree.
Gone
was
the
coarse
brown
tint!
Gone,
too,
was
the
horrid
scar
which
had
seamed
it
across,
and
the
twisted
lip
which
had
given
the
repulsive
sneer
to
the
face!
A
twitch
brought
away
the
tangled
red
hair,
and
there,
sitting
up
in
his
bed,
was
a
pale,
sad-faced,
refined-looking
man,
black-haired
and
smooth-skinned,
rubbing
his
eyes
and
staring
about
him
with
sleepy
bewilderment.
Then
suddenly
realising
the
exposure,
he
broke
into
a
scream
and
threw
himself
down
with
his
face
to
the
pillow.
"Great
heavens!"
cried
the
inspector,
"it
is,
indeed,
the
missing
man.
I
know
him
from
the
photograph."
The
prisoner
turned
with
the
reckless
air
of
a
man
who
abandons
himself
to
his
destiny.
"Be
it
so,"
said
he.
"And
pray
what
am
I
charged
with?"
"With
making
away
with
Mr.
Neville
St.--
Oh,
come,
you
can't
be
charged
with
that
unless
they
make
a
case
of
attempted
suicide
of
it,"
said
the
inspector
with
a
grin.
"Well,
I
have
been
twenty-seven
years
in
the
force,
but
this
really
takes
the
cake."
"If
I
am
Mr.
Neville
St.
Clair,
then
it
is
obvious
that
no
crime
has
been
committed,
and
that,
therefore,
I
am
illegally
detained."
"No
crime,
but
a
very
great
error
has
been
committed,"
said
Holmes.
"You
would
have
done
better
to
have
trusted
your
wife."
"It
was
not
the
wife;
it
was
the
children,"
groaned
the
prisoner.
"God
help
me,
I
would
not
have
them
ashamed
of
their
father.
My
God!
What
an
exposure!
What
can
I
do?"
Sherlock
Holmes
sat
down
beside
him
on
the
couch
and
patted
him
kindly
on
the
shoulder.
"If
you
leave
it
to
a
court
of
law
to
clear
the
matter
up,"
said
he,
"of
course
you
can
hardly
avoid
publicity.
On
the
other
hand,
if
you
convince
the
police
authorities
that
there
is
no
possible
case
against
you,
I
do
not
know
that
there
is
any
reason
that
the
details
should
find
their
way
into
the
papers.
Inspector
Bradstreet
would,
I
am
sure,
make
notes
upon
anything
which
you
might
tell
us
and
submit
it
to
the
proper
authorities.
The
case
would
then
never
go
into
court
at
all."
"God
bless
you!"
cried
the
prisoner
passionately.
"I
would
have
endured
imprisonment,
ay,
even
execution,
rather
than
have
left
my
miserable
secret
as
a
family
blot
to
my
children.
"You
are
the
first
who
have
ever
heard
my
story.
My
father
was
a
schoolmaster
in
Chesterfield,
where
I
received
an
excellent
education.
I
travelled
in
my
youth,
took
to
the
stage,
and
finally
became
a
reporter
on
an
evening
paper
in
London.
One
day
my
editor
wished
to
have
a
series
of
articles
upon
begging
in
the
metropolis,
and
I
volunteered
to
supply
them.
There
was
the
point
from
which
all
my
adventures
started.
It
was
only
by
trying
begging
as
an
amateur
that
I
could
get
the
facts
upon
which
to
base
my
articles.
When
an
actor
I
had,
of
course,
learned
all
the
secrets
of
making
up,
and
had
been
famous
in
the
green-room
for
my
skill.
I
took
advantage
now
of
my
attainments.
I
painted
my
face,
and
to
make
myself
as
pitiable
as
possible
I
made
a
good
scar
and
fixed
one
side
of
my
lip
in
a
twist
by
the
aid
of
a
small
slip
of
flesh-coloured
plaster.
Then
with
a
red
head
of
hair,
and
an
appropriate
dress,
I
took
my
station
in
the
business
part
of
the
city,
ostensibly
as
a
match-seller
but
really
as
a
beggar.
For
seven
hours
I
plied
my
trade,
and
when
I
returned
home
in
the
evening
I
found
to
my
surprise
that
I
had
received
no
less
than
26s.
4d.
"I
wrote
my
articles
and
thought
little
more
of
the
matter
until,
some
time
later,
I
backed
a
bill
for
a
friend
and
had
a
writ
served
upon
me
for
25
pounds.
I
was
at
my
wit's
end
where
to
get
the
money,
but
a
sudden
idea
came
to
me.
I
begged
a
fortnight's
grace
from
the
creditor,
asked
for
a
holiday
from
my
employers,
and
spent
the
time
in
begging
in
the
City
under
my
disguise.
In
ten
days
I
had
the
money
and
had
paid
the
debt.
"Well,
you
can
imagine
how
hard
it
was
to
settle
down
to
arduous
work
at
2
pounds
a
week
when
I
knew
that
I
could
earn
as
much
in
a
day
by
smearing
my
face
with
a
little
paint,
laying
my
cap
on
the
ground,
and
sitting
still.
It
was
a
long
fight
between
my
pride
and
the
money,
but
the
dollars
won
at
last,
and
I
threw
up
reporting
and
sat
day
after
day
in
the
corner
which
I
had
first
chosen,
inspiring
pity
by
my
ghastly
face
and
filling
my
pockets
with
coppers.
Only
one
man
knew
my
secret.
He
was
the
keeper
of
a
low
den
in
which
I
used
to
lodge
in
Swandam
Lane,
where
I
could
every
morning
emerge
as
a
squalid
beggar
and
in
the
evenings
transform
myself
into
a
well-dressed
man
about
town.
This
fellow,
a
Lascar,
was
well
paid
by
me
for
his
rooms,
so
that
I
knew
that
my
secret
was
safe
in
his
possession.
"Well,
very
soon
I
found
that
I
was
saving
considerable
sums
of
money.
I
do
not
mean
that
any
beggar
in
the
streets
of
London
could
earn
700
pounds
a
year--which
is
less
than
my
average
takings--but
I
had
exceptional
advantages
in
my
power
of
making
up,
and
also
in
a
facility
of
repartee,
which
improved
by
practice
and
made
me
quite
a
recognised
character
in
the
City.
All
day
a
stream
of
pennies,
varied
by
silver,
poured
in
upon
me,
and
it
was
a
very
bad
day
in
which
I
failed
to
take
2
pounds.
"As
I
grew
richer
I
grew
more
ambitious,
took
a
house
in
the
country,
and
eventually
married,
without
anyone
having
a
suspicion
as
to
my
real
occupation.
My
dear
wife
knew
that
I
had
business
in
the
City.
She
little
knew
what.
"Last
Monday
I
had
finished
for
the
day
and
was
dressing
in
my
room
above
the
opium
den
when
I
looked
out
of
my
window
and
saw,
to
my
horror
and
astonishment,
that
my
wife
was
standing
in
the
street,
with
her
eyes
fixed
full
upon
me.
I
gave
a
cry
of
surprise,
threw
up
my
arms
to
cover
my
face,
and,
rushing
to
my
confidant,
the
Lascar,
entreated
him
to
prevent
anyone
from
coming
up
to
me.
I
heard
her
voice
downstairs,
but
I
knew
that
she
could
not
ascend.
Swiftly
I
threw
off
my
clothes,
pulled
on
those
of
a
beggar,
and
put
on
my
pigments
and
wig.
Even
a
wife's
eyes
could
not
pierce
so
complete
a
disguise.
But
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
there
might
be
a
search
in
the
room,
and
that
the
clothes
might
betray
me.
I
threw
open
the
window,
reopening
by
my
violence
a
small
cut
which
I
had
inflicted
upon
myself
in
the
bedroom
that
morning.
Then
I
seized
my
coat,
which
was
weighted
by
the
coppers
which
I
had
just
transferred
to
it
from
the
leather
bag
in
which
I
carried
my
takings.
I
hurled
it
out
of
the
window,
and
it
disappeared
into
the
Thames.
The
other
clothes
would
have
followed,
but
at
that
moment
there
was
a
rush
of
constables
up
the
stair,
and
a
few
minutes
after
I
found,
rather,
I
confess,
to
my
relief,
that
instead
of
being
identified
as
Mr.
Neville
St.
Clair,
I
was
arrested
as
his
murderer.
"I
do
not
know
that
there
is
anything
else
for
me
to
explain.
I
was
determined
to
preserve
my
disguise
as
long
as
possible,
and
hence
my
preference
for
a
dirty
face.
Knowing
that
my
wife
would
be
terribly
anxious,
I
slipped
off
my
ring
and
confided
it
to
the
Lascar
at
a
moment
when
no
constable
was
watching
me,
together
with
a
hurried
scrawl,
telling
her
that
she
had
no
cause
to
fear."
"That
note
only
reached
her
yesterday,"
said
Holmes.
"Good
God!
What
a
week
she
must
have
spent!"
"The
police
have
watched
this
Lascar,"
said
Inspector
Bradstreet,
"and
I
can
quite
understand
that
he
might
find
it
difficult
to
post
a
letter
unobserved.
Probably
he
handed
it
to
some
sailor
customer
of
his,
who
forgot
all
about
it
for
some
days."
"That
was
it,"
said
Holmes,
nodding
approvingly;
"I
have
no
doubt
of
it.
But
have
you
never
been
prosecuted
for
begging?"
"Many
times;
but
what
was
a
fine
to
me?"
"It
must
stop
here,
however,"
said
Bradstreet.
"If
the
police
are
to
hush
this
thing
up,
there
must
be
no
more
of
Hugh
Boone."
"I
have
sworn
it
by
the
most
solemn
oaths
which
a
man
can
take."
"In
that
case
I
think
that
it
is
probable
that
no
further
steps
may
be
taken.
But
if
you
are
found
again,
then
all
must
come
out.
I
am
sure,
Mr.
Holmes,
that
we
are
very
much
indebted
to
you
for
having
cleared
the
matter
up.
I
wish
I
knew
how
you
reach
your
results."
"I
reached
this
one,"
said
my
friend,
"by
sitting
upon
five
pillows
and
consuming
an
ounce
of
shag.
I
think,
Watson,
that
if
we
drive
to
Baker
Street
we
shall
just
be
in
time
for
breakfast."
VII.
THE
ADVENTURE
OF
THE
BLUE
CARBUNCLE
I
had
called
upon
my
friend
Sherlock
Holmes
upon
the
second
morning
after
Christmas,
with
the
intention
of
wishing
him
the
compliments
of
the
season.
He
was
lounging
upon
the
sofa
in
a
purple
dressing-gown,
a
pipe-rack
within
his
reach
upon
the
right,
and
a
pile
of
crumpled
morning
papers,
evidently
newly
studied,
near
at
hand.
Beside
the
couch
was
a
wooden
chair,
and
on
the
angle
of
the
back
hung
a
very
seedy
and
disreputable
hard-felt
hat,
much
the
worse
for
wear,
and
cracked
in
several
places.
A
lens
and
a
forceps
lying
upon
the
seat
of
the
chair
suggested
that
the
hat
had
been
suspended
in
this
manner
for
the
purpose
of
examination.
"You
are
engaged,"
said
I;
"perhaps
I
interrupt
you."
"Not
at
all.
I
am
glad
to
have
a
friend
with
whom
I
can
discuss
my
results.
The
matter
is
a
perfectly
trivial
one"--he
jerked
his
thumb
in
the
direction
of
the
old
hat--"but
there
are
points
in
connection
with
it
which
are
not
entirely
devoid
of
interest
and
even
of
instruction."
I
seated
myself
in
his
armchair
and
warmed
my
hands
before
his
crackling
fire,
for
a
sharp
frost
had
set
in,
and
the
windows
were
thick
with
the
ice
crystals.
"I
suppose,"
I
remarked,
"that,
homely
as
it
looks,
this
thing
has
some
deadly
story
linked
on
to
it--that
it
is
the
clue
which
will
guide
you
in
the
solution
of
some
mystery
and
the
punishment
of
some
crime."
"No,
no.
No
crime,"
said
Sherlock
Holmes,
laughing.
"Only
one
of
those
whimsical
little
incidents
which
will
happen
when
you
have
four
million
human
beings
all
jostling
each
other
within
the
space
of
a
few
square
miles.
Amid
the
action
and
reaction
of
so
dense
a
swarm
of
humanity,
every
possible
combination
of
events
may
be
expected
to
take
place,
and
many
a
little
problem
will
be
presented
which
may
be
striking
and
bizarre
without
being
criminal.
We
have
already
had
experience
of
such."
"So
much
so,"
I
remarked,
"that
of
the
last
six
cases
which
I
have
added
to
my
notes,
three
have
been
entirely
free
of
any
legal
crime."
"Precisely.
You
allude
to
my
attempt
to
recover
the
Irene
Adler
papers,
to
the
singular
case
of
Miss
Mary
Sutherland,
and
to
the
adventure
of
the
man
with
the
twisted
lip.
Well,
I
have
no
doubt
that
this
small
matter
will
fall
into
the
same
innocent
category.
You
know
Peterson,
the
commissionaire?"
"Yes."
"It
is
to
him
that
this
trophy
belongs."
"It
is
his
hat."
"No,
no,
he
found
it.
Its
owner
is
unknown.
I
beg
that
you
will
look
upon
it
not
as
a
battered
billycock
but
as
an
intellectual
problem.
And,
first,
as
to
how
it
came
here.
It
arrived
upon
Christmas
morning,
in
company
with
a
good
fat
goose,
which
is,
I
have
no
doubt,
roasting
at
this
moment
in
front
of
Peterson's
fire.
The
facts
are
these:
about
four
o'clock
on
Christmas
morning,
Peterson,
who,
as
you
know,
is
a
very
honest
fellow,
was
returning
from
some
small
jollification
and
was
making
his
way
homeward
down
Tottenham
Court
Road.
In
front
of
him
he
saw,
in
the
gaslight,
a
tallish
man,
walking
with
a
slight
stagger,
and
carrying
a
white
goose
slung
over
his
shoulder.
As
he
reached
the
corner
of
Goodge
Street,
a
row
broke
out
between
this
stranger
and
a
little
knot
of
roughs.
One
of
the
latter
knocked
off
the
man's
hat,
on
which
he
raised
his
stick
to
defend
himself
and,
swinging
it
over
his
head,
smashed
the
shop
window
behind
him.
Peterson
had
rushed
forward
to
protect
the
stranger
from
his
assailants;
but
the
man,
shocked
at
having
broken
the
window,
and
seeing
an
official-looking
person
in
uniform
rushing
towards
him,
dropped
his
goose,
took
to
his
heels,
and
vanished
amid
the
labyrinth
of
small
streets
which
lie
at
the
back
of
Tottenham
Court
Road.
The
roughs
had
also
fled
at
the
appearance
of
Peterson,
so
that
he
was
left
in
possession
of
the
field
of
battle,
and
also
of
the
spoils
of
victory
in
the
shape
of
this
battered
hat
and
a
most
unimpeachable
Christmas
goose."
"Which
surely
he
restored
to
their
owner?"
"My
dear
fellow,
there
lies
the
problem.
It
is
true
that
'For
Mrs.
Henry
Baker'
was
printed
upon
a
small
card
which
was
tied
to
the
bird's
left
leg,
and
it
is
also
true
that
the
initials
'H.
B.'
are
legible
upon
the
lining
of
this
hat,
but
as
there
are
some
thousands
of
Bakers,
and
some
hundreds
of
Henry
Bakers
in
this
city
of
ours,
it
is
not
easy
to
restore
lost
property
to
any
one
of
them."
"What,
then,
did
Peterson
do?"
"He
brought
round
both
hat
and
goose
to
me
on
Christmas
morning,
knowing
that
even
the
smallest
problems
are
of
interest
to
me.
The
goose
we
retained
until
this
morning,
when
there
were
signs
that,
in
spite
of
the
slight
frost,
it
would
be
well
that
it
should
be
eaten
without
unnecessary
delay.
Its
finder
has
carried
it
off,
therefore,
to
fulfil
the
ultimate
destiny
of
a
goose,
while
I
continue
to
retain
the
hat
of
the
unknown
gentleman
who
lost
his
Christmas
dinner."
"Did
he
not
advertise?"
"No."
"Then,
what
clue
could
you
have
as
to
his
identity?"
"Only
as
much
as
we
can
deduce."
"From
his
hat?"
"Precisely."
"But
you
are
joking.
What
can
you
gather
from
this
old
battered
felt?"
"Here
is
my
lens.
You
know
my
methods.
What
can
you
gather
yourself
as
to
the
individuality
of
the
man
who
has
worn
this
article?"
I
took
the
tattered
object
in
my
hands
and
turned
it
over
rather
ruefully.
It
was
a
very
ordinary
black
hat
of
the
usual
round
shape,
hard
and
much
the
worse
for
wear.
The
lining
had
been
of
red
silk,
but
was
a
good
deal
discoloured.
There
was
no
maker's
name;
but,
as
Holmes
had
remarked,
the
initials
"H.
B."
were
scrawled
upon
one
side.
It
was
pierced
in
the
brim
for
a
hat-securer,
but
the
elastic
was
missing.
For
the
rest,
it
was
cracked,
exceedingly
dusty,
and
spotted
in
several
places,
although
there
seemed
to
have
been
some
attempt
to
hide
the
discoloured
patches
by
smearing
them
with
ink.
"I
can
see
nothing,"
said
I,
handing
it
back
to
my
friend.
"On
the
contrary,
Watson,
you
can
see
everything.
You
fail,
however,
to
reason
from
what
you
see.
You
are
too
timid
in
drawing
your
inferences."
"Then,
pray
tell
me
what
it
is
that
you
can
infer
from
this
hat?"
He
picked
it
up
and
gazed
at
it
in
the
peculiar
introspective
fashion
which
was
characteristic
of
him.
"It
is
perhaps
less
suggestive
than
it
might
have
been,"
he
remarked,
"and
yet
there
are
a
few
inferences
which
are
very
distinct,
and
a
few
others
which
represent
at
least
a
strong
balance
of
probability.
That
the
man
was
highly
intellectual
is
of
course
obvious
upon
the
face
of
it,
and
also
that
he
was
fairly
well-to-do
within
the
last
three
years,
although
he
has
now
fallen
upon
evil
days.
He
had
foresight,
but
has
less
now
than
formerly,
pointing
to
a
moral
retrogression,
which,
when
taken
with
the
decline
of
his
fortunes,
seems
to
indicate
some
evil
influence,
probably
drink,
at
work
upon
him.
This
may
account
also
for
the
obvious
fact
that
his
wife
has
ceased
to
love
him."
"My
dear
Holmes!"
"He
has,
however,
retained
some
degree
of
self-respect,"
he
continued,
disregarding
my
remonstrance.
"He
is
a
man
who
leads
a
sedentary
life,
goes
out
little,
is
out
of
training
entirely,
is
middle-aged,
has
grizzled
hair
which
he
has
had
cut
within
the
last
few
days,
and
which
he
anoints
with
lime-cream.
These
are
the
more
patent
facts
which
are
to
be
deduced
from
his
hat.
Also,
by
the
way,
that
it
is
extremely
improbable
that
he
has
gas
laid
on
in
his
house."
"You
are
certainly
joking,
Holmes."
"Not
in
the
least.
Is
it
possible
that
even
now,
when
I
give
you
these
results,
you
are
unable
to
see
how
they
are
attained?"
"I
have
no
doubt
that
I
am
very
stupid,
but
I
must
confess
that
I
am
unable
to
follow
you.
For
example,
how
did
you
deduce
that
this
man
was
intellectual?"
For
answer
Holmes
clapped
the
hat
upon
his
head.
It
came
right
over
the
forehead
and
settled
upon
the
bridge
of
his
nose.
"It
is
a
question
of
cubic
capacity,"
said
he;
"a
man
with
so
large
a
brain
must
have
something
in
it."
"The
decline
of
his
fortunes,
then?"
"This
hat
is
three
years
old.
These
flat
brims
curled
at
the
edge
came
in
then.
It
is
a
hat
of
the
very
best
quality.
Look
at
the
band
of
ribbed
silk
and
the
excellent
lining.
If
this
man
could
afford
to
buy
so
expensive
a
hat
three
years
ago,
and
has
had
no
hat
since,
then
he
has
assuredly
gone
down
in
the
world."
"Well,
that
is
clear
enough,
certainly.
But
how
about
the
foresight
and
the
moral
retrogression?"
Sherlock
Holmes
laughed.
"Here
is
the
foresight,"
said
he
putting
his
finger
upon
the
little
disc
and
loop
of
the
hat-securer.
"They
are
never
sold
upon
hats.
If
this
man
ordered
one,
it
is
a
sign
of
a
certain
amount
of
foresight,
since
he
went
out
of
his
way
to
take
this
precaution
against
the
wind.
But
since
we
see
that
he
has
broken
the
elastic
and
has
not
troubled
to
replace
it,
it
is
obvious
that
he
has
less
foresight
now
than
formerly,
which
is
a
distinct
proof
of
a
weakening
nature.
On
the
other
hand,
he
has
endeavoured
to
conceal
some
of
these
stains
upon
the
felt
by
daubing
them
with
ink,
which
is
a
sign
that
he
has
not
entirely
lost
his
self-respect."
"Your
reasoning
is
certainly
plausible."
"The
further
points,
that
he
is
middle-aged,
that
his
hair
is
grizzled,
that
it
has
been
recently
cut,
and
that
he
uses
lime-cream,
are
all
to
be
gathered
from
a
close
examination
of
the
lower
part
of
the
lining.
The
lens
discloses
a
large
number
of
hair-ends,
clean
cut
by
the
scissors
of
the
barber.
They
all
appear
to
be
adhesive,
and
there
is
a
distinct
odour
of
lime-cream.
This
dust,
you
will
observe,
is
not
the
gritty,
grey
dust
of
the
street
but
the
fluffy
brown
dust
of
the
house,
showing
that
it
has
been
hung
up
indoors
most
of
the
time,
while
the
marks
of
moisture
upon
the
inside
are
proof
positive
that
the
wearer
perspired
very
freely,
and
could
therefore,
hardly
be
in
the
best
of
training."
"But
his
wife--you
said
that
she
had
ceased
to
love
him."
"This
hat
has
not
been
brushed
for
weeks.
When
I
see
you,
my
dear
Watson,
with
a
week's
accumulation
of
dust
upon
your
hat,
and
when
your
wife
allows
you
to
go
out
in
such
a
state,
I
shall
fear
that
you
also
have
been
unfortunate
enough
to
lose
your
wife's
affection."
"But
he
might
be
a
bachelor."
"Nay,
he
was
bringing
home
the
goose
as
a
peace-offering
to
his
wife.
Remember
the
card
upon
the
bird's
leg."
"You
have
an
answer
to
everything.
But
how
on
earth
do
you
deduce
that
the
gas
is
not
laid
on
in
his
house?"
"One
tallow
stain,
or
even
two,
might
come
by
chance;
but
when
I
see
no
less
than
five,
I
think
that
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
individual
must
be
brought
into
frequent
contact
with
burning
tallow--walks
upstairs
at
night
probably
with
his
hat
in
one
hand
and
a
guttering
candle
in
the
other.
Anyhow,
he
never
got
tallow-stains
from
a
gas-jet.
Are
you
satisfied?"
"Well,
it
is
very
ingenious,"
said
I,
laughing;
"but
since,
as
you
said
just
now,
there
has
been
no
crime
committed,
and
no
harm
done
save
the
loss
of
a
goose,
all
this
seems
to
be
rather
a
waste
of
energy."
Sherlock
Holmes
had
opened
his
mouth
to
reply,
when
the
door
flew
open,
and
Peterson,
the
commissionaire,
rushed
into
the
apartment
with
flushed
cheeks
and
the
face
of
a
man
who
is
dazed
with
astonishment.
"The
goose,
Mr.
Holmes!
The
goose,
sir!"
he
gasped.
"Eh?
What
of
it,
then?
Has
it
returned
to
life
and
flapped
off
through
the
kitchen
window?"
Holmes
twisted
himself
round
upon
the
sofa
to
get
a
fairer
view
of
the
man's
excited
face.
"See
here,
sir!
See
what
my
wife
found
in
its
crop!"
He
held
out
his
hand
and
displayed
upon
the
centre
of
the
palm
a
brilliantly
scintillating
blue
stone,
rather
smaller
than
a
bean
in
size,
but
of
such
purity
and
radiance
that
it
twinkled
like
an
electric
point
in
the
dark
hollow
of
his
hand.
Sherlock
Holmes
sat
up
with
a
whistle.
"By
Jove,
Peterson!"
said
he,
"this
is
treasure
trove
indeed.
I
suppose
you
know
what
you
have
got?"
"A
diamond,
sir?
A
precious
stone.
It
cuts
into
glass
as
though
it
were
putty."
"It's
more
than
a
precious
stone.
It
is
the
precious
stone."
"Not
the
Countess
of
Morcar's
blue
carbuncle!"
I
ejaculated.
"Precisely
so.
I
ought
to
know
its
size
and
shape,
seeing
that
I
have
read
the
advertisement
about
it
in
The
Times
every
day
lately.
It
is
absolutely
unique,
and
its
value
can
only
be
conjectured,
but
the
reward
offered
of
1000
pounds
is
certainly
not
within
a
twentieth
part
of
the
market
price."
"A
thousand
pounds!
Great
Lord
of
mercy!"
The
commissionaire
plumped
down
into
a
chair
and
stared
from
one
to
the
other
of
us.
"That
is
the
reward,
and
I
have
reason
to
know
that
there
are
sentimental
considerations
in
the
background
which
would
induce
the
Countess
to
part
with
half
her
fortune
if
she
could
but
recover
the
gem."
"It
was
lost,
if
I
remember
aright,
at
the
Hotel
Cosmopolitan,"
I
remarked.
"Precisely
so,
on
December
22nd,
just
five
days
ago.
John
Horner,
a
plumber,
was
accused
of
having
abstracted
it
from
the
lady's
jewel-case.
The
evidence
against
him
was
so
strong
that
the
case
has
been
referred
to
the
Assizes.
I
have
some
account
of
the
matter
here,
I
believe."
He
rummaged
amid
his
newspapers,
glancing
over
the
dates,
until
at
last
he
smoothed
one
out,
doubled
it
over,
and
read
the
following
paragraph:
"Hotel
Cosmopolitan
Jewel
Robbery.
John
Horner,
26,
plumber,
was
brought
up
upon
the
charge
of
having
upon
the
22nd
inst.,
abstracted
from
the
jewel-case
of
the
Countess
of
Morcar
the
valuable
gem
known
as
the
blue
carbuncle.
James
Ryder,
upper-attendant
at
the
hotel,
gave
his
evidence
to
the
effect
that
he
had
shown
Horner
up
to
the
dressing-room
of
the
Countess
of
Morcar
upon
the
day
of
the
robbery
in
order
that
he
might
solder
the
second
bar
of
the
grate,
which
was
loose.
He
had
remained
with
Horner
some
little
time,
but
had
finally
been
called
away.
On
returning,
he
found
that
Horner
had
disappeared,
that
the
bureau
had
been
forced
open,
and
that
the
small
morocco
casket
in
which,
as
it
afterwards
transpired,
the
Countess
was
accustomed
to
keep
her
jewel,
was
lying
empty
upon
the
dressing-table.
Ryder
instantly
gave
the
alarm,
and
Horner
was
arrested
the
same
evening;
but
the
stone
could
not
be
found
either
upon
his
person
or
in
his
rooms.
Catherine
Cusack,
maid
to
the
Countess,
deposed
to
having
heard
Ryder's
cry
of
dismay
on
discovering
the
robbery,
and
to
having
rushed
into
the
room,
where
she
found
matters
as
described
by
the
last
witness.
Inspector
Bradstreet,
B
division,
gave
evidence
as
to
the
arrest
of
Horner,
who
struggled
frantically,
and
protested
his
innocence
in
the
strongest
terms.
Evidence
of
a
previous
conviction
for
robbery
having
been
given
against
the
prisoner,
the
magistrate
refused
to
deal
summarily
with
the
offence,
but
referred
it
to
the
Assizes.
Horner,
who
had
shown
signs
of
intense
emotion
during
the
proceedings,
fainted
away
at
the
conclusion
and
was
carried
out
of
court."
"Hum!
So
much
for
the
police-court,"
said
Holmes
thoughtfully,
tossing
aside
the
paper.
"The
question
for
us
now
to
solve
is
the
sequence
of
events
leading
from
a
rifled
jewel-case
at
one
end
to
the
crop
of
a
goose
in
Tottenham
Court
Road
at
the
other.
You
see,
Watson,
our
little
deductions
have
suddenly
assumed
a
much
more
important
and
less
innocent
aspect.
Here
is
the
stone;
the
stone
came
from
the
goose,
and
the
goose
came
from
Mr.
Henry
Baker,
the
gentleman
with
the
bad
hat
and
all
the
other
characteristics
with
which
I
have
bored
you.
So
now
we
must
set
ourselves
very
seriously
to
finding
this
gentleman
and
ascertaining
what
part
he
has
played
in
this
little
mystery.
To
do
this,
we
must
try
the
simplest
means
first,
and
these
lie
undoubtedly
in
an
advertisement
in
all
the
evening
papers.
If
this
fail,
I
shall
have
recourse
to
other
methods."
"What
will
you
say?"
"Give
me
a
pencil
and
that
slip
of
paper.
Now,
then:
'Found
at
the
corner
of
Goodge
Street,
a
goose
and
a
black
felt
hat.
Mr.
Henry
Baker
can
have
the
same
by
applying
at
6:30
this
evening
at
221B,
Baker
Street.'
That
is
clear
and
concise."
"Very.
But
will
he
see
it?"
"Well,
he
is
sure
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
papers,
since,
to
a
poor
man,
the
loss
was
a
heavy
one.
He
was
clearly
so
scared
by
his
mischance
in
breaking
the
window
and
by
the
approach
of
Peterson
that
he
thought
of
nothing
but
flight,
but
since
then
he
must
have
bitterly
regretted
the
impulse
which
caused
him
to
drop
his
bird.
Then,
again,
the
introduction
of
his
name
will
cause
him
to
see
it,
for
everyone
who
knows
him
will
direct
his
attention
to
it.
Here
you
are,
Peterson,
run
down
to
the
advertising
agency
and
have
this
put
in
the
evening
papers."
"In
which,
sir?"
"Oh,
in
the
Globe,
Star,
Pall
Mall,
St.
James's,
Evening
News,
Standard,
Echo,
and
any
others
that
occur
to
you."
"Very
well,
sir.
And
this
stone?"
"Ah,
yes,
I
shall
keep
the
stone.
Thank
you.
And,
I
say,
Peterson,
just
buy
a
goose
on
your
way
back
and
leave
it
here
with
me,
for
we
must
have
one
to
give
to
this
gentleman
in
place
of
the
one
which
your
family
is
now
devouring."
When
the
commissionaire
had
gone,
Holmes
took
up
the
stone
and
held
it
against
the
light.
"It's
a
bonny
thing,"
said
he.
"Just
see
how
it
glints
and
sparkles.
Of
course
it
is
a
nucleus
and
focus
of
crime.
Every
good
stone
is.
They
are
the
devil's
pet
baits.
In
the
larger
and
older
jewels
every
facet
may
stand
for
a
bloody
deed.
This
stone
is
not
yet
twenty
years
old.
It
was
found
in
the
banks
of
the
Amoy
River
in
southern
China
and
is
remarkable
in
having
every
characteristic
of
the
carbuncle,
save
that
it
is
blue
in
shade
instead
of
ruby
red.
In
spite
of
its
youth,
it
has
already
a
sinister
history.
There
have
been
two
murders,
a
vitriol-throwing,
a
suicide,
and
several
robberies
brought
about
for
the
sake
of
this
forty-grain
weight
of
crystallised
charcoal.
Who
would
think
that
so
pretty
a
toy
would
be
a
purveyor
to
the
gallows
and
the
prison?
I'll
lock
it
up
in
my
strong
box
now
and
drop
a
line
to
the
Countess
to
say
that
we
have
it."
"Do
you
think
that
this
man
Horner
is
innocent?"
"I
cannot
tell."
"Well,
then,
do
you
imagine
that
this
other
one,
Henry
Baker,
had
anything
to
do
with
the
matter?"
"It
is,
I
think,
much
more
likely
that
Henry
Baker
is
an
absolutely
innocent
man,
who
had
no
idea
that
the
bird
which
he
was
carrying
was
of
considerably
more
value
than
if
it
were
made
of
solid
gold.
That,
however,
I
shall
determine
by
a
very
simple
test
if
we
have
an
answer
to
our
advertisement."
"And
you
can
do
nothing
until
then?"
"Nothing."
"In
that
case
I
shall
continue
my
professional
round.
But
I
shall
come
back
in
the
evening
at
the
hour
you
have
mentioned,
for
I
should
like
to
see
the
solution
of
so
tangled
a
business."
"Very
glad
to
see
you.
I
dine
at
seven.
There
is
a
woodcock,
I
believe.
By
the
way,
in
view
of
recent
occurrences,
perhaps
I
ought
to
ask
Mrs.
Hudson
to
examine
its
crop."
I
had
been
delayed
at
a
case,
and
it
was
a
little
after
half-past
six
when
I
found
myself
in
Baker
Street
once
more.
As
I
approached
the
house
I
saw
a
tall
man
in
a
Scotch
bonnet
with
a
coat
which
was
buttoned
up
to
his
chin
waiting
outside
in
the
bright
semicircle
which
was
thrown
from
the
fanlight.
Just
as
I
arrived
the
door
was
opened,
and
we
were
shown
up
together
to
Holmes'
room.
"Mr.
Henry
Baker,
I
believe,"
said
he,
rising
from
his
armchair
and
greeting
his
visitor
with
the
easy
air
of
geniality
which
he
could
so
readily
assume.
"Pray
take
this
chair
by
the
fire,
Mr.
Baker.
It
is
a
cold
night,
and
I
observe
that
your
circulation
is
more
adapted
for
summer
than
for
winter.
Ah,
Watson,
you
have
just
come
at
the
right
time.
Is
that
your
hat,
Mr.
Baker?"
"Yes,
sir,
that
is
undoubtedly
my
hat."
He
was
a
large
man
with
rounded
shoulders,
a
massive
head,
and
a
broad,
intelligent
face,
sloping
down
to
a
pointed
beard
of
grizzled
brown.
A
touch
of
red
in
nose
and
cheeks,
with
a
slight
tremor
of
his
extended
hand,
recalled
Holmes'
surmise
as
to
his
habits.
His
rusty
black
frock-coat
was
buttoned
right
up
in
front,
with
the
collar
turned
up,
and
his
lank
wrists
protruded
from
his
sleeves
without
a
sign
of
cuff
or
shirt.
He
spoke
in
a
slow
staccato
fashion,
choosing
his
words
with
care,
and
gave
the
impression
generally
of
a
man
of
learning
and
letters
who
had
had
ill-usage
at
the
hands
of
fortune.
"We
have
retained
these
things
for
some
days,"
said
Holmes,
"because
we
expected
to
see
an
advertisement
from
you
giving
your
address.
I
am
at
a
loss
to
know
now
why
you
did
not
advertise."
Our
visitor
gave
a
rather
shamefaced
laugh.
"Shillings
have
not
been
so
plentiful
with
me
as
they
once
were,"
he
remarked.
"I
had
no
doubt
that
the
gang
of
roughs
who
assaulted
me
had
carried
off
both
my
hat
and
the
bird.
I
did
not
care
to
spend
more
money
in
a
hopeless
attempt
at
recovering
them."
"Very
naturally.
By
the
way,
about
the
bird,
we
were
compelled
to
eat
it."
"To
eat
it!"
Our
visitor
half
rose
from
his
chair
in
his
excitement.
"Yes,
it
would
have
been
of
no
use
to
anyone
had
we
not
done
so.
But
I
presume
that
this
other
goose
upon
the
sideboard,
which
is
about
the
same
weight
and
perfectly
fresh,
will
answer
your
purpose
equally
well?"
"Oh,
certainly,
certainly,"
answered
Mr.
Baker
with
a
sigh
of
relief.
"Of
course,
we
still
have
the
feathers,
legs,
crop,
and
so
on
of
your
own
bird,
so
if
you
wish--"
The
man
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh.
"They
might
be
useful
to
me
as
relics
of
my
adventure,"
said
he,
"but
beyond
that
I
can
hardly
see
what
use
the
disjecta
membra
of
my
late
acquaintance
are
going
to
be
to
me.
No,
sir,
I
think
that,
with
your
permission,
I
will
confine
my
attentions
to
the
excellent
bird
which
I
perceive
upon
the
sideboard."
Sherlock
Holmes
glanced
sharply
across
at
me
with
a
slight
shrug
of
his
shoulders.
"There
is
your
hat,
then,
and
there
your
bird,"
said
he.
"By
the
way,
would
it
bore
you
to
tell
me
where
you
got
the
other
one
from?
I
am
somewhat
of
a
fowl
fancier,
and
I
have
seldom
seen
a
better
grown
goose."
"Certainly,
sir,"
said
Baker,
who
had
risen
and
tucked
his
newly
gained
property
under
his
arm.
"There
are
a
few
of
us
who
frequent
the
Alpha
Inn,
near
the
Museum--we
are
to
be
found
in
the
Museum
itself
during
the
day,
you
understand.
This
year
our
good
host,
Windigate
by
name,
instituted
a
goose
club,
by
which,
on
consideration
of
some
few
pence
every
week,
we
were
each
to
receive
a
bird
at
Christmas.
My
pence
were
duly
paid,
and
the
rest
is
familiar
to
you.
I
am
much
indebted
to
you,
sir,
for
a
Scotch
bonnet
is
fitted
neither
to
my
years
nor
my
gravity."
With
a
comical
pomposity
of
manner
he
bowed
solemnly
to
both
of
us
and
strode
off
upon
his
way.
"So
much
for
Mr.
Henry
Baker,"
said
Holmes
when
he
had
closed
the
door
behind
him.
"It
is
quite
certain
that
he
knows
nothing
whatever
about
the
matter.
Are
you
hungry,
Watson?"
"Not
particularly."
"Then
I
suggest
that
we
turn
our
dinner
into
a
supper
and
follow
up
this
clue
while
it
is
still
hot."
"By
all
means."
It
was
a
bitter
night,
so
we
drew
on
our
ulsters
and
wrapped
cravats
about
our
throats.
Outside,
the
stars
were
shining
coldly
in
a
cloudless
sky,
and
the
breath
of
the
passers-by
blew
out
into
smoke
like
so
many
pistol
shots.
Our
footfalls
rang
out
crisply
and
loudly
as
we
swung
through
the
doctors'
quarter,
Wimpole
Street,
Harley
Street,
and
so
through
Wigmore
Street
into
Oxford
Street.
In
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
were
in
Bloomsbury
at
the
Alpha
Inn,
which
is
a
small
public-house
at
the
corner
of
one
of
the
streets
which
runs
down
into
Holborn.
Holmes
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
private
bar
and
ordered
two
glasses
of
beer
from
the
ruddy-faced,
white-aproned
landlord.
"Your
beer
should
be
excellent
if
it
is
as
good
as
your
geese,"
said
he.
"My
geese!"
The
man
seemed
surprised.
"Yes.
I
was
speaking
only
half
an
hour
ago
to
Mr.
Henry
Baker,
who
was
a
member
of
your
goose
club."
"Ah!
yes,
I
see.
But
you
see,
sir,
them's
not
our
geese."
"Indeed!
Whose,
then?"
"Well,
I
got
the
two
dozen
from
a
salesman
in
Covent
Garden."
"Indeed?
I
know
some
of
them.
Which
was
it?"
"Breckinridge
is
his
name."
"Ah!
I
don't
know
him.
Well,
here's
your
good
health
landlord,
and
prosperity
to
your
house.
Good-night."
"Now
for
Mr.
Breckinridge,"
he
continued,
buttoning
up
his
coat
as
we
came
out
into
the
frosty
air.
"Remember,
Watson
that
though
we
have
so
homely
a
thing
as
a
goose
at
one
end
of
this
chain,
we
have
at
the
other
a
man
who
will
certainly
get
seven
years'
penal
servitude
unless
we
can
establish
his
innocence.
It
is
possible
that
our
inquiry
may
but
confirm
his
guilt;
but,
in
any
case,
we
have
a
line
of
investigation
which
has
been
missed
by
the
police,
and
which
a
singular
chance
has
placed
in
our
hands.
Let
us
follow
it
out
to
the
bitter
end.
Faces
to
the
south,
then,
and
quick
march!"
We
passed
across
Holborn,
down
Endell
Street,
and
so
through
a
zigzag
of
slums
to
Covent
Garden
Market.
One
of
the
largest
stalls
bore
the
name
of
Breckinridge
upon
it,
and
the
proprietor
a
horsey-looking
man,
with
a
sharp
face
and
trim
side-whiskers
was
helping
a
boy
to
put
up
the
shutters.
"Good-evening.
It's
a
cold
night,"
said
Holmes.
The
salesman
nodded
and
shot
a
questioning
glance
at
my
companion.
"Sold
out
of
geese,
I
see,"
continued
Holmes,
pointing
at
the
bare
slabs
of
marble.
"Let
you
have
five
hundred
to-morrow
morning."
"That's
no
good."
"Well,
there
are
some
on
the
stall
with
the
gas-flare."
"Ah,
but
I
was
recommended
to
you."
"Who
by?"
"The
landlord
of
the
Alpha."
"Oh,
yes;
I
sent
him
a
couple
of
dozen."
"Fine
birds
they
were,
too.
Now
where
did
you
get
them
from?"
To
my
surprise
the
question
provoked
a
burst
of
anger
from
the
salesman.
"Now,
then,
mister,"
said
he,
with
his
head
cocked
and
his
arms
akimbo,
"what
are
you
driving
at?
Let's
have
it
straight,
now."
"It
is
straight
enough.
I
should
like
to
know
who
sold
you
the
geese
which
you
supplied
to
the
Alpha."
"Well
then,
I
shan't
tell
you.
So
now!"
"Oh,
it
is
a
matter
of
no
importance;
but
I
don't
know
why
you
should
be
so
warm
over
such
a
trifle."
"Warm!
You'd
be
as
warm,
maybe,
if
you
were
as
pestered
as
I
am.
When
I
pay
good
money
for
a
good
article
there
should
be
an
end
of
the
business;
but
it's
'Where
are
the
geese?'
and
'Who
did
you
sell
the
geese
to?'
and
'What
will
you
take
for
the
geese?'
One
would
think
they
were
the
only
geese
in
the
world,
to
hear
the
fuss
that
is
made
over
them."
"Well,
I
have
no
connection
with
any
other
people
who
have
been
making
inquiries,"
said
Holmes
carelessly.
"If
you
won't
tell
us
the
bet
is
off,
that
is
all.
But
I'm
always
ready
to
back
my
opinion
on
a
matter
of
fowls,
and
I
have
a
fiver
on
it
that
the
bird
I
ate
is
country
bred."
"Well,
then,
you've
lost
your
fiver,
for
it's
town
bred,"
snapped
the
salesman.
"It's
nothing
of
the
kind."
"I
say
it
is."
"I
don't
believe
it."
"D'you
think
you
know
more
about
fowls
than
I,
who
have
handled
them
ever
since
I
was
a
nipper?
I
tell
you,
all
those
birds
that
went
to
the
Alpha
were
town
bred."
"You'll
never
persuade
me
to
believe
that."
"Will
you
bet,
then?"
"It's
merely
taking
your
money,
for
I
know
that
I
am
right.
But
I'll
have
a
sovereign
on
with
you,
just
to
teach
you
not
to
be
obstinate."
The
salesman
chuckled
grimly.
"Bring
me
the
books,
Bill,"
said
he.
The
small
boy
brought
round
a
small
thin
volume
and
a
great
greasy-backed
one,
laying
them
out
together
beneath
the
hanging
lamp.
"Now
then,
Mr.
Cocksure,"
said
the
salesman,
"I
thought
that
I
was
out
of
geese,
but
before
I
finish
you'll
find
that
there
is
still
one
left
in
my
shop.
You
see
this
little
book?"
"Well?"
"That's
the
list
of
the
folk
from
whom
I
buy.
D'you
see?
Well,
then,
here
on
this
page
are
the
country
folk,
and
the
numbers
after
their
names
are
where
their
accounts
are
in
the
big
ledger.
Now,
then!
You
see
this
other
page
in
red
ink?
Well,
that
is
a
list
of
my
town
suppliers.
Now,
look
at
that
third
name.
Just
read
it
out
to
me."
"Mrs.
Oakshott,
117,
Brixton
Road--249,"
read
Holmes.
"Quite
so.
Now
turn
that
up
in
the
ledger."
Holmes
turned
to
the
page
indicated.
"Here
you
are,
'Mrs.
Oakshott,
117,
Brixton
Road,
egg
and
poultry
supplier.'"
"Now,
then,
what's
the
last
entry?"
"'December
22nd.
Twenty-four
geese
at
7s.
6d.'"
"Quite
so.
There
you
are.
And
underneath?"
"'Sold
to
Mr.
Windigate
of
the
Alpha,
at
12s.'"
"What
have
you
to
say
now?"
Sherlock
Holmes
looked
deeply
chagrined.
He
drew
a
sovereign
from
his
pocket
and
threw
it
down
upon
the
slab,
turning
away
with
the
air
of
a
man
whose
disgust
is
too
deep
for
words.
A
few
yards
off
he
stopped
under
a
lamp-post
and
laughed
in
the
hearty,
noiseless
fashion
which
was
peculiar
to
him.
"When
you
see
a
man
with
whiskers
of
that
cut
and
the
'Pink
'un'
protruding
out
of
his
pocket,
you
can
always
draw
him
by
a
bet,"
said
he.
"I
daresay
that
if
I
had
put
100
pounds
down
in
front
of
him,
that
man
would
not
have
given
me
such
complete
information
as
was
drawn
from
him
by
the
idea
that
he
was
doing
me
on
a
wager.
Well,
Watson,
we
are,
I
fancy,
nearing
the
end
of
our
quest,
and
the
only
point
which
remains
to
be
determined
is
whether
we
should
go
on
to
this
Mrs.
Oakshott
to-night,
or
whether
we
should
reserve
it
for
to-morrow.
It
is
clear
from
what
that
surly
fellow
said
that
there
are
others
besides
ourselves
who
are
anxious
about
the
matter,
and
I
should--"
His
remarks
were
suddenly
cut
short
by
a
loud
hubbub
which
broke
out
from
the
stall
which
we
had
just
left.
Turning
round
we
saw
a
little
rat-faced
fellow
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
of
yellow
light
which
was
thrown
by
the
swinging
lamp,
while
Breckinridge,
the
salesman,
framed
in
the
door
of
his
stall,
was
shaking
his
fists
fiercely
at
the
cringing
figure.
"I've
had
enough
of
you
and
your
geese,"
he
shouted.
"I
wish
you
were
all
at
the
devil
together.
If
you
come
pestering
me
any
more
with
your
silly
talk
I'll
set
the
dog
at
you.
You
bring
Mrs.
Oakshott
here
and
I'll
answer
her,
but
what
have
you
to
do
with
it?
Did
I
buy
the
geese
off
you?"
"No;
but
one
of
them
was
mine
all
the
same,"
whined
the
little
man.
"Well,
then,
ask
Mrs.
Oakshott
for
it."
"She
told
me
to
ask
you."
"Well,
you
can
ask
the
King
of
Proosia,
for
all
I
care.
I've
had
enough
of
it.
Get
out
of
this!"
He
rushed
fiercely
forward,
and
the
inquirer
flitted
away
into
the
darkness.
"Ha!
this
may
save
us
a
visit
to
Brixton
Road,"
whispered
Holmes.
"Come
with
me,
and
we
will
see
what
is
to
be
made
of
this
fellow."
Striding
through
the
scattered
knots
of
people
who
lounged
round
the
flaring
stalls,
my
companion
speedily
overtook
the
little
man
and
touched
him
upon
the
shoulder.
He
sprang
round,
and
I
could
see
in
the
gas-light
that
every
vestige
of
colour
had
been
driven
from
his
face.
"Who
are
you,
then?
What
do
you
want?"
he
asked
in
a
quavering
voice.
"You
will
excuse
me,"
said
Holmes
blandly,
"but
I
could
not
help
overhearing
the
questions
which
you
put
to
the
salesman
just
now.
I
think
that
I
could
be
of
assistance
to
you."
"You?
Who
are
you?
How
could
you
know
anything
of
the
matter?"
"My
name
is
Sherlock
Holmes.
It
is
my
business
to
know
what
other
people
don't
know."
"But
you
can
know
nothing
of
this?"
"Excuse
me,
I
know
everything
of
it.
You
are
endeavouring
to
trace
some
geese
which
were
sold
by
Mrs.
Oakshott,
of
Brixton
Road,
to
a
salesman
named
Breckinridge,
by
him
in
turn
to
Mr.
Windigate,
of
the
Alpha,
and
by
him
to
his
club,
of
which
Mr.
Henry
Baker
is
a
member."
"Oh,
sir,
you
are
the
very
man
whom
I
have
longed
to
meet,"
cried
the
little
fellow
with
outstretched
hands
and
quivering
fingers.
"I
can
hardly
explain
to
you
how
interested
I
am
in
this
matter."
Sherlock
Holmes
hailed
a
four-wheeler
which
was
passing.
"In
that
case
we
had
better
discuss
it
in
a
cosy
room
rather
than
in
this
wind-swept
market-place,"
said
he.
"But
pray
tell
me,
before
we
go
farther,
who
it
is
that
I
have
the
pleasure
of
assisting."
The
man
hesitated
for
an
instant.
"My
name
is
John
Robinson,"
he
answered
with
a
sidelong
glance.
"No,
no;
the
real
name,"
said
Holmes
sweetly.
"It
is
always
awkward
doing
business
with
an
alias."
A
flush
sprang
to
the
white
cheeks
of
the
stranger.
"Well
then,"
said
he,
"my
real
name
is
James
Ryder."
"Precisely
so.
Head
attendant
at
the
Hotel
Cosmopolitan.
Pray
step
into
the
cab,
and
I
shall
soon
be
able
to
tell
you
everything
which
you
would
wish
to
know."
The
little
man
stood
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
with
half-frightened,
half-hopeful
eyes,
as
one
who
is
not
sure
whether
he
is
on
the
verge
of
a
windfall
or
of
a
catastrophe.
Then
he
stepped
into
the
cab,
and
in
half
an
hour
we
were
back
in
the
sitting-room
at
Baker
Street.
Nothing
had
been
said
during
our
drive,
but
the
high,
thin
breathing
of
our
new
companion,
and
the
claspings
and
unclaspings
of
his
hands,
spoke
of
the
nervous
tension
within
him.
"Here
we
are!"
said
Holmes
cheerily
as
we
filed
into
the
room.
"The
fire
looks
very
seasonable
in
this
weather.
You
look
cold,
Mr.
Ryder.
Pray
take
the
basket-chair.
I
will
just
put
on
my
slippers
before
we
settle
this
little
matter
of
yours.
Now,
then!
You
want
to
know
what
became
of
those
geese?"
"Yes,
sir."
"Or
rather,
I
fancy,
of
that
goose.
It
was
one
bird,
I
imagine
in
which
you
were
interested--white,
with
a
black
bar
across
the
tail."
Ryder
quivered
with
emotion.
"Oh,
sir,"
he
cried,
"can
you
tell
me
where
it
went
to?"
"It
came
here."
"Here?"
"Yes,
and
a
most
remarkable
bird
it
proved.
I
don't
wonder
that
you
should
take
an
interest
in
it.
It
laid
an
egg
after
it
was
dead--the
bonniest,
brightest
little
blue
egg
that
ever
was
seen.
I
have
it
here
in
my
museum."
Our
visitor
staggered
to
his
feet
and
clutched
the
mantelpiece
with
his
right
hand.
Holmes
unlocked
his
strong-box
and
held
up
the
blue
carbuncle,
which
shone
out
like
a
star,
with
a
cold,
brilliant,
many-pointed
radiance.
Ryder
stood
glaring
with
a
drawn
face,
uncertain
whether
to
claim
or
to
disown
it.
"The
game's
up,
Ryder,"
said
Holmes
quietly.
"Hold
up,
man,
or
you'll
be
into
the
fire!
Give
him
an
arm
back
into
his
chair,
Watson.
He's
not
got
blood
enough
to
go
in
for
felony
with
impunity.
Give
him
a
dash
of
brandy.
So!
Now
he
looks
a
little
more
human.
What
a
shrimp
it
is,
to
be
sure!"
For
a
moment
he
had
staggered
and
nearly
fallen,
but
the
brandy
brought
a
tinge
of
colour
into
his
cheeks,
and
he
sat
staring
with
frightened
eyes
at
his
accuser.
"I
have
almost
every
link
in
my
hands,
and
all
the
proofs
which
I
could
possibly
need,
so
there
is
little
which
you
need
tell
me.
Still,
that
little
may
as
well
be
cleared
up
to
make
the
case
complete.
You
had
heard,
Ryder,
of
this
blue
stone
of
the
Countess
of
Morcar's?"
"It
was
Catherine
Cusack
who
told
me
of
it,"
said
he
in
a
crackling
voice.
"I
see--her
ladyship's
waiting-maid.
Well,
the
temptation
of
sudden
wealth
so
easily
acquired
was
too
much
for
you,
as
it
has
been
for
better
men
before
you;
but
you
were
not
very
scrupulous
in
the
means
you
used.
It
seems
to
me,
Ryder,
that
there
is
the
making
of
a
very
pretty
villain
in
you.
You
knew
that
this
man
Horner,
the
plumber,
had
been
concerned
in
some
such
matter
before,
and
that
suspicion
would
rest
the
more
readily
upon
him.
What
did
you
do,
then?
You
made
some
small
job
in
my
lady's
room--you
and
your
confederate
Cusack--and
you
managed
that
he
should
be
the
man
sent
for.
Then,
when
he
had
left,
you
rifled
the
jewel-case,
raised
the
alarm,
and
had
this
unfortunate
man
arrested.
You
then--"
Ryder
threw
himself
down
suddenly
upon
the
rug
and
clutched
at
my
companion's
knees.
"For
God's
sake,
have
mercy!"
he
shrieked.
"Think
of
my
father!
Of
my
mother!
It
would
break
their
hearts.
I
never
went
wrong
before!
I
never
will
again.
I
swear
it.
I'll
swear
it
on
a
Bible.
Oh,
don't
bring
it
into
court!
For
Christ's
sake,
don't!"
"Get
back
into
your
chair!"
said
Holmes
sternly.
"It
is
very
well
to
cringe
and
crawl
now,
but
you
thought
little
enough
of
this
poor
Horner
in
the
dock
for
a
crime
of
which
he
knew
nothing."
"I
will
fly,
Mr.
Holmes.
I
will
leave
the
country,
sir.
Then
the
charge
against
him
will
break
down."
"Hum!
We
will
talk
about
that.
And
now
let
us
hear
a
true
account
of
the
next
act.
How
came
the
stone
into
the
goose,
and
how
came
the
goose
into
the
open
market?
Tell
us
the
truth,
for
there
lies
your
only
hope
of
safety."
Ryder
passed
his
tongue
over
his
parched
lips.
"I
will
tell
you
it
just
as
it
happened,
sir,"
said
he.
"When
Horner
had
been
arrested,
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
would
be
best
for
me
to
get
away
with
the
stone
at
once,
for
I
did
not
know
at
what
moment
the
police
might
not
take
it
into
their
heads
to
search
me
and
my
room.
There
was
no
place
about
the
hotel
where
it
would
be
safe.
I
went
out,
as
if
on
some
commission,
and
I
made
for
my
sister's
house.
She
had
married
a
man
named
Oakshott,
and
lived
in
Brixton
Road,
where
she
fattened
fowls
for
the
market.
All
the
way
there
every
man
I
met
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
policeman
or
a
detective;
and,
for
all
that
it
was
a
cold
night,
the
sweat
was
pouring
down
my
face
before
I
came
to
the
Brixton
Road.
My
sister
asked
me
what
was
the
matter,
and
why
I
was
so
pale;
but
I
told
her
that
I
had
been
upset
by
the
jewel
robbery
at
the
hotel.
Then
I
went
into
the
back
yard
and
smoked
a
pipe
and
wondered
what
it
would
be
best
to
do.
"I
had
a
friend
once
called
Maudsley,
who
went
to
the
bad,
and
has
just
been
serving
his
time
in
Pentonville.
One
day
he
had
met
me,
and
fell
into
talk
about
the
ways
of
thieves,
and
how
they
could
get
rid
of
what
they
stole.
I
knew
that
he
would
be
true
to
me,
for
I
knew
one
or
two
things
about
him;
so
I
made
up
my
mind
to
go
right
on
to
Kilburn,
where
he
lived,
and
take
him
into
my
confidence.
He
would
show
me
how
to
turn
the
stone
into
money.
But
how
to
get
to
him
in
safety?
I
thought
of
the
agonies
I
had
gone
through
in
coming
from
the
hotel.
I
might
at
any
moment
be
seized
and
searched,
and
there
would
be
the
stone
in
my
waistcoat
pocket.
I
was
leaning
against
the
wall
at
the
time
and
looking
at
the
geese
which
were
waddling
about
round
my
feet,
and
suddenly
an
idea
came
into
my
head
which
showed
me
how
I
could
beat
the
best
detective
that
ever
lived.
"My
sister
had
told
me
some
weeks
before
that
I
might
have
the
pick
of
her
geese
for
a
Christmas
present,
and
I
knew
that
she
was
always
as
good
as
her
word.
I
would
take
my
goose
now,
and
in
it
I
would
carry
my
stone
to
Kilburn.
There
was
a
little
shed
in
the
yard,
and
behind
this
I
drove
one
of
the
birds--a
fine
big
one,
white,
with
a
barred
tail.
I
caught
it,
and
prying
its
bill
open,
I
thrust
the
stone
down
its
throat
as
far
as
my
finger
could
reach.
The
bird
gave
a
gulp,
and
I
felt
the
stone
pass
along
its
gullet
and
down
into
its
crop.
But
the
creature
flapped
and
struggled,
and
out
came
my
sister
to
know
what
was
the
matter.
As
I
turned
to
speak
to
her
the
brute
broke
loose
and
fluttered
off
among
the
others.
"'Whatever
were
you
doing
with
that
bird,
Jem?'
says
she.
"'Well,'
said
I,
'you
said
you'd
give
me
one
for
Christmas,
and
I
was
feeling
which
was
the
fattest.'
"'Oh,'
says
she,
'we've
set
yours
aside
for
you--Jem's
bird,
we
call
it.
It's
the
big
white
one
over
yonder.
There's
twenty-six
of
them,
which
makes
one
for
you,
and
one
for
us,
and
two
dozen
for
the
market.'
"'Thank
you,
Maggie,'
says
I;
'but
if
it
is
all
the
same
to
you,
I'd
rather
have
that
one
I
was
handling
just
now.'
"'The
other
is
a
good
three
pound
heavier,'
said
she,
'and
we
fattened
it
expressly
for
you.'
"'Never
mind.
I'll
have
the
other,
and
I'll
take
it
now,'
said
I.
"'Oh,
just
as
you
like,'
said
she,
a
little
huffed.
'Which
is
it
you
want,
then?'
"'That
white
one
with
the
barred
tail,
right
in
the
middle
of
the
flock.'
"'Oh,
very
well.
Kill
it
and
take
it
with
you.'
"Well,
I
did
what
she
said,
Mr.
Holmes,
and
I
carried
the
bird
all
the
way
to
Kilburn.
I
told
my
pal
what
I
had
done,
for
he
was
a
man
that
it
was
easy
to
tell
a
thing
like
that
to.
He
laughed
until
he
choked,
and
we
got
a
knife
and
opened
the
goose.
My
heart
turned
to
water,
for
there
was
no
sign
of
the
stone,
and
I
knew
that
some
terrible
mistake
had
occurred.
I
left
the
bird,
rushed
back
to
my
sister's,
and
hurried
into
the
back
yard.
There
was
not
a
bird
to
be
seen
there.
"'Where
are
they
all,
Maggie?'
I
cried.
"'Gone
to
the
dealer's,
Jem.'
"'Which
dealer's?'
"'Breckinridge,
of
Covent
Garden.'
"'But
was
there
another
with
a
barred
tail?'
I
asked,
'the
same
as
the
one
I
chose?'
"'Yes,
Jem;
there
were
two
barred-tailed
ones,
and
I
could
never
tell
them
apart.'
"Well,
then,
of
course
I
saw
it
all,
and
I
ran
off
as
hard
as
my
feet
would
carry
me
to
this
man
Breckinridge;
but
he
had
sold
the
lot
at
once,
and
not
one
word
would
he
tell
me
as
to
where
they
had
gone.
You
heard
him
yourselves
to-night.
Well,
he
has
always
answered
me
like
that.
My
sister
thinks
that
I
am
going
mad.
Sometimes
I
think
that
I
am
myself.
And
now--and
now
I
am
myself
a
branded
thief,
without
ever
having
touched
the
wealth
for
which
I
sold
my
character.
God
help
me!
God
help
me!"
He
burst
into
convulsive
sobbing,
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands.
There
was
a
long
silence,
broken
only
by
his
heavy
breathing
and
by
the
measured
tapping
of
Sherlock
Holmes'
finger-tips
upon
the
edge
of
the
table.
Then
my
friend
rose
and
threw
open
the
door.
"Get
out!"
said
he.
"What,
sir!
Oh,
Heaven
bless
you!"
"No
more
words.
Get
out!"
And
no
more
words
were
needed.
There
was
a
rush,
a
clatter
upon
the
stairs,
the
bang
of
a
door,
and
the
crisp
rattle
of
running
footfalls
from
the
street.
"After
all,
Watson,"
said
Holmes,
reaching
up
his
hand
for
his
clay
pipe,
"I
am
not
retained
by
the
police
to
supply
their
deficiencies.
If
Horner
were
in
danger
it
would
be
another
thing;
but
this
fellow
will
not
appear
against
him,
and
the
case
must
collapse.
I
suppose
that
I
am
commuting
a
felony,
but
it
is
just
possible
that
I
am
saving
a
soul.
This
fellow
will
not
go
wrong
again;
he
is
too
terribly
frightened.
Send
him
to
gaol
now,
and
you
make
him
a
gaol-bird
for
life.
Besides,
it
is
the
season
of
forgiveness.
Chance
has
put
in
our
way
a
most
singular
and
whimsical
problem,
and
its
solution
is
its
own
reward.
If
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
touch
the
bell,
Doctor,
we
will
begin
another
investigation,
in
which,
also
a
bird
will
be
the
chief
feature."
VIII.
THE
ADVENTURE
OF
THE
SPECKLED
BAND
On
glancing
over
my
notes
of
the
seventy
odd
cases
in
which
I
have
during
the
last
eight
years
studied
the
methods
of
my
friend
Sherlock
Holmes,
I
find
many
tragic,
some
comic,
a
large
number
merely
strange,
but
none
commonplace;
for,
working
as
he
did
rather
for
the
love
of
his
art
than
for
the
acquirement
of
wealth,
he
refused
to
associate
himself
with
any
investigation
which
did
not
tend
towards
the
unusual,
and
even
the
fantastic.
Of
all
these
varied
cases,
however,
I
cannot
recall
any
which
presented
more
singular
features
than
that
which
was
associated
with
the
well-known
Surrey
family
of
the
Roylotts
of
Stoke
Moran.
The
events
in
question
occurred
in
the
early
days
of
my
association
with
Holmes,
when
we
were
sharing
rooms
as
bachelors
in
Baker
Street.
It
is
possible
that
I
might
have
placed
them
upon
record
before,
but
a
promise
of
secrecy
was
made
at
the
time,
from
which
I
have
only
been
freed
during
the
last
month
by
the
untimely
death
of
the
lady
to
whom
the
pledge
was
given.
It
is
perhaps
as
well
that
the
facts
should
now
come
to
light,
for
I
have
reasons
to
know
that
there
are
widespread
rumours
as
to
the
death
of
Dr.
Grimesby
Roylott
which
tend
to
make
the
matter
even
more
terrible
than
the
truth.
It
was
early
in
April
in
the
year
'83
that
I
woke
one
morning
to
find
Sherlock
Holmes
standing,
fully
dressed,
by
the
side
of
my
bed.
He
was
a
late
riser,
as
a
rule,
and
as
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
showed
me
that
it
was
only
a
quarter-past
seven,
I
blinked
up
at
him
in
some
surprise,
and
perhaps
just
a
little
resentment,
for
I
was
myself
regular
in
my
habits.
"Very
sorry
to
knock
you
up,
Watson,"
said
he,
"but
it's
the
common
lot
this
morning.
Mrs.
Hudson
has
been
knocked
up,
she
retorted
upon
me,
and
I
on
you."
"What
is
it,
then--a
fire?"
"No;
a
client.
It
seems
that
a
young
lady
has
arrived
in
a
considerable
state
of
excitement,
who
insists
upon
seeing
me.
She
is
waiting
now
in
the
sitting-room.
Now,
when
young
ladies
wander
about
the
metropolis
at
this
hour
of
the
morning,
and
knock
sleepy
people
up
out
of
their
beds,
I
presume
that
it
is
something
very
pressing
which
they
have
to
communicate.
Should
it
prove
to
be
an
interesting
case,
you
would,
I
am
sure,
wish
to
follow
it
from
the
outset.
I
thought,
at
any
rate,
that
I
should
call
you
and
give
you
the
chance."
"My
dear
fellow,
I
would
not
miss
it
for
anything."
I
had
no
keener
pleasure
than
in
following
Holmes
in
his
professional
investigations,
and
in
admiring
the
rapid
deductions,
as
swift
as
intuitions,
and
yet
always
founded
on
a
logical
basis
with
which
he
unravelled
the
problems
which
were
submitted
to
him.
I
rapidly
threw
on
my
clothes
and
was
ready
in
a
few
minutes
to
accompany
my
friend
down
to
the
sitting-room.
A
lady
dressed
in
black
and
heavily
veiled,
who
had
been
sitting
in
the
window,
rose
as
we
entered.
"Good-morning,
madam,"
said
Holmes
cheerily.
"My
name
is
Sherlock
Holmes.
This
is
my
intimate
friend
and
associate,
Dr.
Watson,
before
whom
you
can
speak
as
freely
as
before
myself.
Ha!
I
am
glad
to
see
that
Mrs.
Hudson
has
had
the
good
sense
to
light
the
fire.
Pray
draw
up
to
it,
and
I
shall
order
you
a
cup
of
hot
coffee,
for
I
observe
that
you
are
shivering."
"It
is
not
cold
which
makes
me
shiver,"
said
the
woman
in
a
low
voice,
changing
her
seat
as
requested.
"What,
then?"
"It
is
fear,
Mr.
Holmes.
It
is
terror."
She
raised
her
veil
as
she
spoke,
and
we
could
see
that
she
was
indeed
in
a
pitiable
state
of
agitation,
her
face
all
drawn
and
grey,
with
restless
frightened
eyes,
like
those
of
some
hunted
animal.
Her
features
and
figure
were
those
of
a
woman
of
thirty,
but
her
hair
was
shot
with
premature
grey,
and
her
expression
was
weary
and
haggard.
Sherlock
Holmes
ran
her
over
with
one
of
his
quick,
all-comprehensive
glances.
"You
must
not
fear,"
said
he
soothingly,
bending
forward
and
patting
her
forearm.
"We
shall
soon
set
matters
right,
I
have
no
doubt.
You
have
come
in
by
train
this
morning,
I
see."
"You
know
me,
then?"
"No,
but
I
observe
the
second
half
of
a
return
ticket
in
the
palm
of
your
left
glove.
You
must
have
started
early,
and
yet
you
had
a
good
drive
in
a
dog-cart,
along
heavy
roads,
before
you
reached
the
station."
The
lady
gave
a
violent
start
and
stared
in
bewilderment
at
my
companion.
"There
is
no
mystery,
my
dear
madam,"
said
he,
smiling.
"The
left
arm
of
your
jacket
is
spattered
with
mud
in
no
less
than
seven
places.
The
marks
are
perfectly
fresh.
There
is
no
vehicle
save
a
dog-cart
which
throws
up
mud
in
that
way,
and
then
only
when
you
sit
on
the
left-hand
side
of
the
driver."
"Whatever
your
reasons
may
be,
you
are
perfectly
correct,"
said
she.
"I
started
from
home
before
six,
reached
Leatherhead
at
twenty
past,
and
came
in
by
the
first
train
to
Waterloo.
Sir,
I
can
stand
this
strain
no
longer;
I
shall
go
mad
if
it
continues.
I
have
no
one
to
turn
to--none,
save
only
one,
who
cares
for
me,
and
he,
poor
fellow,
can
be
of
little
aid.
I
have
heard
of
you,
Mr.
Holmes;
I
have
heard
of
you
from
Mrs.
Farintosh,
whom
you
helped
in
the
hour
of
her
sore
need.
It
was
from
her
that
I
had
your
address.
Oh,
sir,
do
you
not
think
that
you
could
help
me,
too,
and
at
least
throw
a
little
light
through
the
dense
darkness
which
surrounds
me?
At
present
it
is
out
of
my
power
to
reward
you
for
your
services,
but
in
a
month
or
six
weeks
I
shall
be
married,
with
the
control
of
my
own
income,
and
then
at
least
you
shall
not
find
me
ungrateful."
Holmes
turned
to
his
desk
and,
unlocking
it,
drew
out
a
small
case-book,
which
he
consulted.
"Farintosh,"
said
he.
"Ah
yes,
I
recall
the
case;
it
was
concerned
with
an
opal
tiara.
I
think
it
was
before
your
time,
Watson.
I
can
only
say,
madam,
that
I
shall
be
happy
to
devote
the
same
care
to
your
case
as
I
did
to
that
of
your
friend.
As
to
reward,
my
profession
is
its
own
reward;
but
you
are
at
liberty
to
defray
whatever
expenses
I
may
be
put
to,
at
the
time
which
suits
you
best.
And
now
I
beg
that
you
will
lay
before
us
everything
that
may
help
us
in
forming
an
opinion
upon
the
matter."
"Alas!"
replied
our
visitor,
"the
very
horror
of
my
situation
lies
in
the
fact
that
my
fears
are
so
vague,
and
my
suspicions
depend
so
entirely
upon
small
points,
which
might
seem
trivial
to
another,
that
even
he
to
whom
of
all
others
I
have
a
right
to
look
for
help
and
advice
looks
upon
all
that
I
tell
him
about
it
as
the
fancies
of
a
nervous
woman.
He
does
not
say
so,
but
I
can
read
it
from
his
soothing
answers
and
averted
eyes.
But
I
have
heard,
Mr.
Holmes,
that
you
can
see
deeply
into
the
manifold
wickedness
of
the
human
heart.
You
may
advise
me
how
to
walk
amid
the
dangers
which
encompass
me."
"I
am
all
attention,
madam."
"My
name
is
Helen
Stoner,
and
I
am
living
with
my
stepfather,
who
is
the
last
survivor
of
one
of
the
oldest
Saxon
families
in
England,
the
Roylotts
of
Stoke
Moran,
on
the
western
border
of
Surrey."
Holmes
nodded
his
head.
"The
name
is
familiar
to
me,"
said
he.
"The
family
was
at
one
time
among
the
richest
in
England,
and
the
estates
extended
over
the
borders
into
Berkshire
in
the
north,
and
Hampshire
in
the
west.
In
the
last
century,
however,
four
successive
heirs
were
of
a
dissolute
and
wasteful
disposition,
and
the
family
ruin
was
eventually
completed
by
a
gambler
in
the
days
of
the
Regency.
Nothing
was
left
save
a
few
acres
of
ground,
and
the
two-hundred-year-old
house,
which
is
itself
crushed
under
a
heavy
mortgage.
The
last
squire
dragged
out
his
existence
there,
living
the
horrible
life
of
an
aristocratic
pauper;
but
his
only
son,
my
stepfather,
seeing
that
he
must
adapt
himself
to
the
new
conditions,
obtained
an
advance
from
a
relative,
which
enabled
him
to
take
a
medical
degree
and
went
out
to
Calcutta,
where,
by
his
professional
skill
and
his
force
of
character,
he
established
a
large
practice.
In
a
fit
of
anger,
however,
caused
by
some
robberies
which
had
been
perpetrated
in
the
house,
he
beat
his
native
butler
to
death
and
narrowly
escaped
a
capital
sentence.
As
it
was,
he
suffered
a
long
term
of
imprisonment
and
afterwards
returned
to
England
a
morose
and
disappointed
man.
"When
Dr.
Roylott
was
in
India
he
married
my
mother,
Mrs.
Stoner,
the
young
widow
of
Major-General
Stoner,
of
the
Bengal
Artillery.
My
sister
Julia
and
I
were
twins,
and
we
were
only
two
years
old
at
the
time
of
my
mother's
re-marriage.
She
had
a
considerable
sum
of
money--not
less
than
1000
pounds
a
year--and
this
she
bequeathed
to
Dr.
Roylott
entirely
while
we
resided
with
him,
with
a
provision
that
a
certain
annual
sum
should
be
allowed
to
each
of
us
in
the
event
of
our
marriage.
Shortly
after
our
return
to
England
my
mother
died--she
was
killed
eight
years
ago
in
a
railway
accident
near
Crewe.
Dr.
Roylott
then
abandoned
his
attempts
to
establish
himself
in
practice
in
London
and
took
us
to
live
with
him
in
the
old
ancestral
house
at
Stoke
Moran.
The
money
which
my
mother
had
left
was
enough
for
all
our
wants,
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
obstacle
to
our
happiness.
"But
a
terrible
change
came
over
our
stepfather
about
this
time.
Instead
of
making
friends
and
exchanging
visits
with
our
neighbours,
who
had
at
first
been
overjoyed
to
see
a
Roylott
of
Stoke
Moran
back
in
the
old
family
seat,
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
house
and
seldom
came
out
save
to
indulge
in
ferocious
quarrels
with
whoever
might
cross
his
path.
Violence
of
temper
approaching
to
mania
has
been
hereditary
in
the
men
of
the
family,
and
in
my
stepfather's
case
it
had,
I
believe,
been
intensified
by
his
long
residence
in
the
tropics.
A
series
of
disgraceful
brawls
took
place,
two
of
which
ended
in
the
police-court,
until
at
last
he
became
the
terror
of
the
village,
and
the
folks
would
fly
at
his
approach,
for
he
is
a
man
of
immense
strength,
and
absolutely
uncontrollable
in
his
anger.
"Last
week
he
hurled
the
local
blacksmith
over
a
parapet
into
a
stream,
and
it
was
only
by
paying
over
all
the
money
which
I
could
gather
together
that
I
was
able
to
avert
another
public
exposure.
He
had
no
friends
at
all
save
the
wandering
gipsies,
and
he
would
give
these
vagabonds
leave
to
encamp
upon
the
few
acres
of
bramble-covered
land
which
represent
the
family
estate,
and
would
accept
in
return
the
hospitality
of
their
tents,
wandering
away
with
them
sometimes
for
weeks
on
end.
He
has
a
passion
also
for
Indian
animals,
which
are
sent
over
to
him
by
a
correspondent,
and
he
has
at
this
moment
a
cheetah
and
a
baboon,
which
wander
freely
over
his
grounds
and
are
feared
by
the
villagers
almost
as
much
as
their
master.
"You
can
imagine
from
what
I
say
that
my
poor
sister
Julia
and
I
had
no
great
pleasure
in
our
lives.
No
servant
would
stay
with
us,
and
for
a
long
time
we
did
all
the
work
of
the
house.
She
was
but
thirty
at
the
time
of
her
death,
and
yet
her
hair
had
already
begun
to
whiten,
even
as
mine
has."
"Your
sister
is
dead,
then?"
"She
died
just
two
years
ago,
and
it
is
of
her
death
that
I
wish
to
speak
to
you.
You
can
understand
that,
living
the
life
which
I
have
described,
we
were
little
likely
to
see
anyone
of
our
own
age
and
position.
We
had,
however,
an
aunt,
my
mother's
maiden
sister,
Miss
Honoria
Westphail,
who
lives
near
Harrow,
and
we
were
occasionally
allowed
to
pay
short
visits
at
this
lady's
house.
Julia
went
there
at
Christmas
two
years
ago,
and
met
there
a
half-pay
major
of
marines,
to
whom
she
became
engaged.
My
stepfather
learned
of
the
engagement
when
my
sister
returned
and
offered
no
objection
to
the
marriage;
but
within
a
fortnight
of
the
day
which
had
been
fixed
for
the
wedding,
the
terrible
event
occurred
which
has
deprived
me
of
my
only
companion."
Sherlock
Holmes
had
been
leaning
back
in
his
chair
with
his
eyes
closed
and
his
head
sunk
in
a
cushion,
but
he
half
opened
his
lids
now
and
glanced
across
at
his
visitor.
"Pray
be
precise
as
to
details,"
said
he.
"It
is
easy
for
me
to
be
so,
for
every
event
of
that
dreadful
time
is
seared
into
my
memory.
The
manor-house
is,
as
I
have
already
said,
very
old,
and
only
one
wing
is
now
inhabited.
The
bedrooms
in
this
wing
are
on
the
ground
floor,
the
sitting-rooms
being
in
the
central
block
of
the
buildings.
Of
these
bedrooms
the
first
is
Dr.
Roylott's,
the
second
my
sister's,
and
the
third
my
own.
There
is
no
communication
between
them,
but
they
all
open
out
into
the
same
corridor.
Do
I
make
myself
plain?"
"Perfectly
so."
"The
windows
of
the
three
rooms
open
out
upon
the
lawn.
That
fatal
night
Dr.
Roylott
had
gone
to
his
room
early,
though
we
knew
that
he
had
not
retired
to
rest,
for
my
sister
was
troubled
by
the
smell
of
the
strong
Indian
cigars
which
it
was
his
custom
to
smoke.
She
left
her
room,
therefore,
and
came
into
mine,
where
she
sat
for
some
time,
chatting
about
her
approaching
wedding.
At
eleven
o'clock
she
rose
to
leave
me,
but
she
paused
at
the
door
and
looked
back.
"'Tell
me,
Helen,'
said
she,
'have
you
ever
heard
anyone
whistle
in
the
dead
of
the
night?'
"'Never,'
said
I.
"'I
suppose
that
you
could
not
possibly
whistle,
yourself,
in
your
sleep?'
"'Certainly
not.
But
why?'
"'Because
during
the
last
few
nights
I
have
always,
about
three
in
the
morning,
heard
a
low,
clear
whistle.
I
am
a
light
sleeper,
and
it
has
awakened
me.
I
cannot
tell
where
it
came
from--perhaps
from
the
next
room,
perhaps
from
the
lawn.
I
thought
that
I
would
just
ask
you
whether
you
had
heard
it.'
"'No,
I
have
not.
It
must
be
those
wretched
gipsies
in
the
plantation.'
"'Very
likely.
And
yet
if
it
were
on
the
lawn,
I
wonder
that
you
did
not
hear
it
also.'
"'Ah,
but
I
sleep
more
heavily
than
you.'
"'Well,
it
is
of
no
great
consequence,
at
any
rate.'
She
smiled
back
at
me,
closed
my
door,
and
a
few
moments
later
I
heard
her
key
turn
in
the
lock."
"Indeed,"
said
Holmes.
"Was
it
your
custom
always
to
lock
yourselves
in
at
night?"
"Always."
"And
why?"
"I
think
that
I
mentioned
to
you
that
the
doctor
kept
a
cheetah
and
a
baboon.
We
had
no
feeling
of
security
unless
our
doors
were
locked."
"Quite
so.
Pray
proceed
with
your
statement."
"I
could
not
sleep
that
night.
A
vague
feeling
of
impending
misfortune
impressed
me.
My
sister
and
I,
you
will
recollect,
were
twins,
and
you
know
how
subtle
are
the
links
which
bind
two
souls
which
are
so
closely
allied.
It
was
a
wild
night.
The
wind
was
howling
outside,
and
the
rain
was
beating
and
splashing
against
the
windows.
Suddenly,
amid
all
the
hubbub
of
the
gale,
there
burst
forth
the
wild
scream
of
a
terrified
woman.
I
knew
that
it
was
my
sister's
voice.
I
sprang
from
my
bed,
wrapped
a
shawl
round
me,
and
rushed
into
the
corridor.
As
I
opened
my
door
I
seemed
to
hear
a
low
whistle,
such
as
my
sister
described,
and
a
few
moments
later
a
clanging
sound,
as
if
a
mass
of
metal
had
fallen.
As
I
ran
down
the
passage,
my
sister's
door
was
unlocked,
and
revolved
slowly
upon
its
hinges.
I
stared
at
it
horror-stricken,
not
knowing
what
was
about
to
issue
from
it.
By
the
light
of
the
corridor-lamp
I
saw
my
sister
appear
at
the
opening,
her
face
blanched
with
terror,
her
hands
groping
for
help,
her
whole
figure
swaying
to
and
fro
like
that
of
a
drunkard.
I
ran
to
her
and
threw
my
arms
round
her,
but
at
that
moment
her
knees
seemed
to
give
way
and
she
fell
to
the
ground.
She
writhed
as
one
who
is
in
terrible
pain,
and
her
limbs
were
dreadfully
convulsed.
At
first
I
thought
that
she
had
not
recognised
me,
but
as
I
bent
over
her
she
suddenly
shrieked
out
in
a
voice
which
I
shall
never
forget,
'Oh,
my
God!
Helen!
It
was
the
band!
The
speckled
band!'
There
was
something
else
which
she
would
fain
have
said,
and
she
stabbed
with
her
finger
into
the
air
in
the
direction
of
the
doctor's
room,
but
a
fresh
convulsion
seized
her
and
choked
her
words.
I
rushed
out,
calling
loudly
for
my
stepfather,
and
I
met
him
hastening
from
his
room
in
his
dressing-gown.
When
he
reached
my
sister's
side
she
was
unconscious,
and
though
he
poured
brandy
down
her
throat
and
sent
for
medical
aid
from
the
village,
all
efforts
were
in
vain,
for
she
slowly
sank
and
died
without
having
recovered
her
consciousness.
Such
was
the
dreadful
end
of
my
beloved
sister."
"One
moment,"
said
Holmes,
"are
you
sure
about
this
whistle
and
metallic
sound?
Could
you
swear
to
it?"
"That
was
what
the
county
coroner
asked
me
at
the
inquiry.
It
is
my
strong
impression
that
I
heard
it,
and
yet,
among
the
crash
of
the
gale
and
the
creaking
of
an
old
house,
I
may
possibly
have
been
deceived."
"Was
your
sister
dressed?"
"No,
she
was
in
her
night-dress.
In
her
right
hand
was
found
the
charred
stump
of
a
match,
and
in
her
left
a
match-box."
"Showing
that
she
had
struck
a
light
and
looked
about
her
when
the
alarm
took
place.
That
is
important.
And
what
conclusions
did
the
coroner
come
to?"
"He
investigated
the
case
with
great
care,
for
Dr.
Roylott's
conduct
had
long
been
notorious
in
the
county,
but
he
was
unable
to
find
any
satisfactory
cause
of
death.
My
evidence
showed
that
the
door
had
been
fastened
upon
the
inner
side,
and
the
windows
were
blocked
by
old-fashioned
shutters
with
broad
iron
bars,
which
were
secured
every
night.
The
walls
were
carefully
sounded,
and
were
shown
to
be
quite
solid
all
round,
and
the
flooring
was
also
thoroughly
examined,
with
the
same
result.
The
chimney
is
wide,
but
is
barred
up
by
four
large
staples.
It
is
certain,
therefore,
that
my
sister
was
quite
alone
when
she
met
her
end.
Besides,
there
were
no
marks
of
any
violence
upon
her."
"How
about
poison?"
"The
doctors
examined
her
for
it,
but
without
success."
"What
do
you
think
that
this
unfortunate
lady
died
of,
then?"
"It
is
my
belief
that
she
died
of
pure
fear
and
nervous
shock,
though
what
it
was
that
frightened
her
I
cannot
imagine."
"Were
there
gipsies
in
the
plantation
at
the
time?"
"Yes,
there
are
nearly
always
some
there."
"Ah,
and
what
did
you
gather
from
this
allusion
to
a
band--a
speckled
band?"
"Sometimes
I
have
thought
that
it
was
merely
the
wild
talk
of
delirium,
sometimes
that
it
may
have
referred
to
some
band
of
people,
perhaps
to
these
very
gipsies
in
the
plantation.
I
do
not
know
whether
the
spotted
handkerchiefs
which
so
many
of
them
wear
over
their
heads
might
have
suggested
the
strange
adjective
which
she
used."
Holmes
shook
his
head
like
a
man
who
is
far
from
being
satisfied.
"These
are
very
deep
waters,"
said
he;
"pray
go
on
with
your
narrative."
"Two
years
have
passed
since
then,
and
my
life
has
been
until
lately
lonelier
than
ever.
A
month
ago,
however,
a
dear
friend,
whom
I
have
known
for
many
years,
has
done
me
the
honour
to
ask
my
hand
in
marriage.
His
name
is
Armitage--Percy
Armitage--the
second
son
of
Mr.
Armitage,
of
Crane
Water,
near
Reading.
My
stepfather
has
offered
no
opposition
to
the
match,
and
we
are
to
be
married
in
the
course
of
the
spring.
Two
days
ago
some
repairs
were
started
in
the
west
wing
of
the
building,
and
my
bedroom
wall
has
been
pierced,
so
that
I
have
had
to
move
into
the
chamber
in
which
my
sister
died,
and
to
sleep
in
the
very
bed
in
which
she
slept.
Imagine,
then,
my
thrill
of
terror
when
last
night,
as
I
lay
awake,
thinking
over
her
terrible
fate,
I
suddenly
heard
in
the
silence
of
the
night
the
low
whistle
which
had
been
the
herald
of
her
own
death.
I
sprang
up
and
lit
the
lamp,
but
nothing
was
to
be
seen
in
the
room.
I
was
too
shaken
to
go
to
bed
again,
however,
so
I
dressed,
and
as
soon
as
it
was
daylight
I
slipped
down,
got
a
dog-cart
at
the
Crown
Inn,
which
is
opposite,
and
drove
to
Leatherhead,
from
whence
I
have
come
on
this
morning
with
the
one
object
of
seeing
you
and
asking
your
advice."
"You
have
done
wisely,"
said
my
friend.
"But
have
you
told
me
all?"
"Yes,
all."
"Miss
Roylott,
you
have
not.
You
are
screening
your
stepfather."
"Why,
what
do
you
mean?"
For
answer
Holmes
pushed
back
the
frill
of
black
lace
which
fringed
the
hand
that
lay
upon
our
visitor's
knee.
Five
little
livid
spots,
the
marks
of
four
fingers
and
a
thumb,
were
printed
upon
the
white
wrist.
"You
have
been
cruelly
used,"
said
Holmes.
The
lady
coloured
deeply
and
covered
over
her
injured
wrist.
"He
is
a
hard
man,"
she
said,
"and
perhaps
he
hardly
knows
his
own
strength."
There
was
a
long
silence,
during
which
Holmes
leaned
his
chin
upon
his
hands
and
stared
into
the
crackling
fire.
"This
is
a
very
deep
business,"
he
said
at
last.
"There
are
a
thousand
details
which
I
should
desire
to
know
before
I
decide
upon
our
course
of
action.
Yet
we
have
not
a
moment
to
lose.
If
we
were
to
come
to
Stoke
Moran
to-day,
would
it
be
possible
for
us
to
see
over
these
rooms
without
the
knowledge
of
your
stepfather?"
"As
it
happens,
he
spoke
of
coming
into
town
to-day
upon
some
most
important
business.
It
is
probable
that
he
will
be
away
all
day,
and
that
there
would
be
nothing
to
disturb
you.
We
have
a
housekeeper
now,
but
she
is
old
and
foolish,
and
I
could
easily
get
her
out
of
the
way."
"Excellent.
You
are
not
averse
to
this
trip,
Watson?"
"By
no
means."
"Then
we
shall
both
come.
What
are
you
going
to
do
yourself?"
"I
have
one
or
two
things
which
I
would
wish
to
do
now
that
I
am
in
town.
But
I
shall
return
by
the
twelve
o'clock
train,
so
as
to
be
there
in
time
for
your
coming."
"And
you
may
expect
us
early
in
the
afternoon.
I
have
myself
some
small
business
matters
to
attend
to.
Will
you
not
wait
and
breakfast?"
"No,
I
must
go.
My
heart
is
lightened
already
since
I
have
confided
my
trouble
to
you.
I
shall
look
forward
to
seeing
you
again
this
afternoon."
She
dropped
her
thick
black
veil
over
her
face
and
glided
from
the
room.
"And
what
do
you
think
of
it
all,
Watson?"
asked
Sherlock
Holmes,
leaning
back
in
his
chair.
"It
seems
to
me
to
be
a
most
dark
and
sinister
business."
"Dark
enough
and
sinister
enough."
"Yet
if
the
lady
is
correct
in
saying
that
the
flooring
and
walls
are
sound,
and
that
the
door,
window,
and
chimney
are
impassable,
then
her
sister
must
have
been
undoubtedly
alone
when
she
met
her
mysterious
end."
"What
becomes,
then,
of
these
nocturnal
whistles,
and
what
of
the
very
peculiar
words
of
the
dying
woman?"
"I
cannot
think."
"When
you
combine
the
ideas
of
whistles
at
night,
the
presence
of
a
band
of
gipsies
who
are
on
intimate
terms
with
this
old
doctor,
the
fact
that
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
doctor
has
an
interest
in
preventing
his
stepdaughter's
marriage,
the
dying
allusion
to
a
band,
and,
finally,
the
fact
that
Miss
Helen
Stoner
heard
a
metallic
clang,
which
might
have
been
caused
by
one
of
those
metal
bars
that
secured
the
shutters
falling
back
into
its
place,
I
think
that
there
is
good
ground
to
think
that
the
mystery
may
be
cleared
along
those
lines."
"But
what,
then,
did
the
gipsies
do?"
"I
cannot
imagine."
"I
see
many
objections
to
any
such
theory."
"And
so
do
I.
It
is
precisely
for
that
reason
that
we
are
going
to
Stoke
Moran
this
day.
I
want
to
see
whether
the
objections
are
fatal,
or
if
they
may
be
explained
away.
But
what
in
the
name
of
the
devil!"
The
ejaculation
had
been
drawn
from
my
companion
by
the
fact
that
our
door
had
been
suddenly
dashed
open,
and
that
a
huge
man
had
framed
himself
in
the
aperture.
His
costume
was
a
peculiar
mixture
of
the
professional
and
of
the
agricultural,
having
a
black
top-hat,
a
long
frock-coat,
and
a
pair
of
high
gaiters,
with
a
hunting-crop
swinging
in
his
hand.
So
tall
was
he
that
his
hat
actually
brushed
the
cross
bar
of
the
doorway,
and
his
breadth
seemed
to
span
it
across
from
side
to
side.
A
large
face,
seared
with
a
thousand
wrinkles,
burned
yellow
with
the
sun,
and
marked
with
every
evil
passion,
was
turned
from
one
to
the
other
of
us,
while
his
deep-set,
bile-shot
eyes,
and
his
high,
thin,
fleshless
nose,
gave
him
somewhat
the
resemblance
to
a
fierce
old
bird
of
prey.
"Which
of
you
is
Holmes?"
asked
this
apparition.
"My
name,
sir;
but
you
have
the
advantage
of
me,"
said
my
companion
quietly.
"I
am
Dr.
Grimesby
Roylott,
of
Stoke
Moran."
"Indeed,
Doctor,"
said
Holmes
blandly.
"Pray
take
a
seat."
"I
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind.
My
stepdaughter
has
been
here.
I
have
traced
her.
What
has
she
been
saying
to
you?"
"It
is
a
little
cold
for
the
time
of
the
year,"
said
Holmes.
"What
has
she
been
saying
to
you?"
screamed
the
old
man
furiously.
"But
I
have
heard
that
the
crocuses
promise
well,"
continued
my
companion
imperturbably.
"Ha!
You
put
me
off,
do
you?"
said
our
new
visitor,
taking
a
step
forward
and
shaking
his
hunting-crop.
"I
know
you,
you
scoundrel!
I
have
heard
of
you
before.
You
are
Holmes,
the
meddler."
My
friend
smiled.
"Holmes,
the
busybody!"
His
smile
broadened.
"Holmes,
the
Scotland
Yard
Jack-in-office!"
Holmes
chuckled
heartily.
"Your
conversation
is
most
entertaining,"
said
he.
"When
you
go
out
close
the
door,
for
there
is
a
decided
draught."
"I
will
go
when
I
have
said
my
say.
Don't
you
dare
to
meddle
with
my
affairs.
I
know
that
Miss
Stoner
has
been
here.
I
traced
her!
I
am
a
dangerous
man
to
fall
foul
of!
See
here."
He
stepped
swiftly
forward,
seized
the
poker,
and
bent
it
into
a
curve
with
his
huge
brown
hands.
"See
that
you
keep
yourself
out
of
my
grip,"
he
snarled,
and
hurling
the
twisted
poker
into
the
fireplace
he
strode
out
of
the
room.
"He
seems
a
very
amiable
person,"
said
Holmes,
laughing.
"I
am
not
quite
so
bulky,
but
if
he
had
remained
I
might
have
shown
him
that
my
grip
was
not
much
more
feeble
than
his
own."
As
he
spoke
he
picked
up
the
steel
poker
and,
with
a
sudden
effort,
straightened
it
out
again.
"Fancy
his
having
the
insolence
to
confound
me
with
the
official
detective
force!
This
incident
gives
zest
to
our
investigation,
however,
and
I
only
trust
that
our
little
friend
will
not
suffer
from
her
imprudence
in
allowing
this
brute
to
trace
her.
And
now,
Watson,
we
shall
order
breakfast,
and
afterwards
I
shall
walk
down
to
Doctors'
Commons,
where
I
hope
to
get
some
data
which
may
help
us
in
this
matter."
It
was
nearly
one
o'clock
when
Sherlock
Holmes
returned
from
his
excursion.
He
held
in
his
hand
a
sheet
of
blue
paper,
scrawled
over
with
notes
and
figures.
"I
have
seen
the
will
of
the
deceased
wife,"
said
he.
"To
determine
its
exact
meaning
I
have
been
obliged
to
work
out
the
present
prices
of
the
investments
with
which
it
is
concerned.
The
total
income,
which
at
the
time
of
the
wife's
death
was
little
short
of
1100
pounds,
is
now,
through
the
fall
in
agricultural
prices,
not
more
than
750
pounds.
Each
daughter
can
claim
an
income
of
250
pounds,
in
case
of
marriage.
It
is
evident,
therefore,
that
if
both
girls
had
married,
this
beauty
would
have
had
a
mere
pittance,
while
even
one
of
them
would
cripple
him
to
a
very
serious
extent.
My
morning's
work
has
not
been
wasted,
since
it
has
proved
that
he
has
the
very
strongest
motives
for
standing
in
the
way
of
anything
of
the
sort.
And
now,
Watson,
this
is
too
serious
for
dawdling,
especially
as
the
old
man
is
aware
that
we
are
interesting
ourselves
in
his
affairs;
so
if
you
are
ready,
we
shall
call
a
cab
and
drive
to
Waterloo.
I
should
be
very
much
obliged
if
you
would
slip
your
revolver
into
your
pocket.
An
Eley's
No.
2
is
an
excellent
argument
with
gentlemen
who
can
twist
steel
pokers
into
knots.
That
and
a
tooth-brush
are,
I
think,
all
that
we
need."
At
Waterloo
we
were
fortunate
in
catching
a
train
for
Leatherhead,
where
we
hired
a
trap
at
the
station
inn
and
drove
for
four
or
five
miles
through
the
lovely
Surrey
lanes.
It
was
a
perfect
day,
with
a
bright
sun
and
a
few
fleecy
clouds
in
the
heavens.
The
trees
and
wayside
hedges
were
just
throwing
out
their
first
green
shoots,
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
pleasant
smell
of
the
moist
earth.
To
me
at
least
there
was
a
strange
contrast
between
the
sweet
promise
of
the
spring
and
this
sinister
quest
upon
which
we
were
engaged.
My
companion
sat
in
the
front
of
the
trap,
his
arms
folded,
his
hat
pulled
down
over
his
eyes,
and
his
chin
sunk
upon
his
breast,
buried
in
the
deepest
thought.
Suddenly,
however,
he
started,
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder,
and
pointed
over
the
meadows.
"Look
there!"
said
he.
A
heavily
timbered
park
stretched
up
in
a
gentle
slope,
thickening
into
a
grove
at
the
highest
point.
From
amid
the
branches
there
jutted
out
the
grey
gables
and
high
roof-tree
of
a
very
old
mansion.
"Stoke
Moran?"
said
he.
"Yes,
sir,
that
be
the
house
of
Dr.
Grimesby
Roylott,"
remarked
the
driver.
"There
is
some
building
going
on
there,"
said
Holmes;
"that
is
where
we
are
going."
"There's
the
village,"
said
the
driver,
pointing
to
a
cluster
of
roofs
some
distance
to
the
left;
"but
if
you
want
to
get
to
the
house,
you'll
find
it
shorter
to
get
over
this
stile,
and
so
by
the
foot-path
over
the
fields.
There
it
is,
where
the
lady
is
walking."
"And
the
lady,
I
fancy,
is
Miss
Stoner,"
observed
Holmes,
shading
his
eyes.
"Yes,
I
think
we
had
better
do
as
you
suggest."
We
got
off,
paid
our
fare,
and
the
trap
rattled
back
on
its
way
to
Leatherhead.
"I
thought
it
as
well,"
said
Holmes
as
we
climbed
the
stile,
"that
this
fellow
should
think
we
had
come
here
as
architects,
or
on
some
definite
business.
It
may
stop
his
gossip.
Good-afternoon,
Miss
Stoner.
You
see
that
we
have
been
as
good
as
our
word."
Our
client
of
the
morning
had
hurried
forward
to
meet
us
with
a
face
which
spoke
her
joy.
"I
have
been
waiting
so
eagerly
for
you,"
she
cried,
shaking
hands
with
us
warmly.
"All
has
turned
out
splendidly.
Dr.
Roylott
has
gone
to
town,
and
it
is
unlikely
that
he
will
be
back
before
evening."
"We
have
had
the
pleasure
of
making
the
doctor's
acquaintance,"
said
Holmes,
and
in
a
few
words
he
sketched
out
what
had
occurred.
Miss
Stoner
turned
white
to
the
lips
as
she
listened.
"Good
heavens!"
she
cried,
"he
has
followed
me,
then."
"So
it
appears."
"He
is
so
cunning
that
I
never
know
when
I
am
safe
from
him.
What
will
he
say
when
he
returns?"
"He
must
guard
himself,
for
he
may
find
that
there
is
someone
more
cunning
than
himself
upon
his
track.
You
must
lock
yourself
up
from
him
to-night.
If
he
is
violent,
we
shall
take
you
away
to
your
aunt's
at
Harrow.
Now,
we
must
make
the
best
use
of
our
time,
so
kindly
take
us
at
once
to
the
rooms
which
we
are
to
examine."
The
building
was
of
grey,
lichen-blotched
stone,
with
a
high
central
portion
and
two
curving
wings,
like
the
claws
of
a
crab,
thrown
out
on
each
side.
In
one
of
these
wings
the
windows
were
broken
and
blocked
with
wooden
boards,
while
the
roof
was
partly
caved
in,
a
picture
of
ruin.
The
central
portion
was
in
little
better
repair,
but
the
right-hand
block
was
comparatively
modern,
and
the
blinds
in
the
windows,
with
the
blue
smoke
curling
up
from
the
chimneys,
showed
that
this
was
where
the
family
resided.
Some
scaffolding
had
been
erected
against
the
end
wall,
and
the
stone-work
had
been
broken
into,
but
there
were
no
signs
of
any
workmen
at
the
moment
of
our
visit.
Holmes
walked
slowly
up
and
down
the
ill-trimmed
lawn
and
examined
with
deep
attention
the
outsides
of
the
windows.
"This,
I
take
it,
belongs
to
the
room
in
which
you
used
to
sleep,
the
centre
one
to
your
sister's,
and
the
one
next
to
the
main
building
to
Dr.
Roylott's
chamber?"
"Exactly
so.
But
I
am
now
sleeping
in
the
middle
one."
"Pending
the
alterations,
as
I
understand.
By
the
way,
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
very
pressing
need
for
repairs
at
that
end
wall."
"There
were
none.
I
believe
that
it
was
an
excuse
to
move
me
from
my
room."
"Ah!
that
is
suggestive.
Now,
on
the
other
side
of
this
narrow
wing
runs
the
corridor
from
which
these
three
rooms
open.
There
are
windows
in
it,
of
course?"
"Yes,
but
very
small
ones.
Too
narrow
for
anyone
to
pass
through."
"As
you
both
locked
your
doors
at
night,
your
rooms
were
unapproachable
from
that
side.
Now,
would
you
have
the
kindness
to
go
into
your
room
and
bar
your
shutters?"
Miss
Stoner
did
so,
and
Holmes,
after
a
careful
examination
through
the
open
window,
endeavoured
in
every
way
to
force
the
shutter
open,
but
without
success.
There
was
no
slit
through
which
a
knife
could
be
passed
to
raise
the
bar.
Then
with
his
lens
he
tested
the
hinges,
but
they
were
of
solid
iron,
built
firmly
into
the
massive
masonry.
"Hum!"
said
he,
scratching
his
chin
in
some
perplexity,
"my
theory
certainly
presents
some
difficulties.
No
one
could
pass
these
shutters
if
they
were
bolted.
Well,
we
shall
see
if
the
inside
throws
any
light
upon
the
matter."
A
small
side
door
led
into
the
whitewashed
corridor
from
which
the
three
bedrooms
opened.
Holmes
refused
to
examine
the
third
chamber,
so
we
passed
at
once
to
the
second,
that
in
which
Miss
Stoner
was
now
sleeping,
and
in
which
her
sister
had
met
with
her
fate.
It
was
a
homely
little
room,
with
a
low
ceiling
and
a
gaping
fireplace,
after
the
fashion
of
old
country-houses.
A
brown
chest
of
drawers
stood
in
one
corner,
a
narrow
white-counterpaned
bed
in
another,
and
a
dressing-table
on
the
left-hand
side
of
the
window.
These
articles,
with
two
small
wicker-work
chairs,
made
up
all
the
furniture
in
the
room
save
for
a
square
of
Wilton
carpet
in
the
centre.
The
boards
round
and
the
panelling
of
the
walls
were
of
brown,
worm-eaten
oak,
so
old
and
discoloured
that
it
may
have
dated
from
the
original
building
of
the
house.
Holmes
drew
one
of
the
chairs
into
a
corner
and
sat
silent,
while
his
eyes
travelled
round
and
round
and
up
and
down,
taking
in
every
detail
of
the
apartment.
"Where
does
that
bell
communicate
with?"
he
asked
at
last
pointing
to
a
thick
bell-rope
which
hung
down
beside
the
bed,
the
tassel
actually
lying
upon
the
pillow.
"It
goes
to
the
housekeeper's
room."
"It
looks
newer
than
the
other
things?"
"Yes,
it
was
only
put
there
a
couple
of
years
ago."
"Your
sister
asked
for
it,
I
suppose?"
"No,
I
never
heard
of
her
using
it.
We
used
always
to
get
what
we
wanted
for
ourselves."
"Indeed,
it
seemed
unnecessary
to
put
so
nice
a
bell-pull
there.
You
will
excuse
me
for
a
few
minutes
while
I
satisfy
myself
as
to
this
floor."
He
threw
himself
down
upon
his
face
with
his
lens
in
his
hand
and
crawled
swiftly
backward
and
forward,
examining
minutely
the
cracks
between
the
boards.
Then
he
did
the
same
with
the
wood-work
with
which
the
chamber
was
panelled.
Finally
he
walked
over
to
the
bed
and
spent
some
time
in
staring
at
it
and
in
running
his
eye
up
and
down
the
wall.
Finally
he
took
the
bell-rope
in
his
hand
and
gave
it
a
brisk
tug.
"Why,
it's
a
dummy,"
said
he.
"Won't
it
ring?"
"No,
it
is
not
even
attached
to
a
wire.
This
is
very
interesting.
You
can
see
now
that
it
is
fastened
to
a
hook
just
above
where
the
little
opening
for
the
ventilator
is."
"How
very
absurd!
I
never
noticed
that
before."
"Very
strange!"
muttered
Holmes,
pulling
at
the
rope.
"There
are
one
or
two
very
singular
points
about
this
room.
For
example,
what
a
fool
a
builder
must
be
to
open
a
ventilator
into
another
room,
when,
with
the
same
trouble,
he
might
have
communicated
with
the
outside
air!"
"That
is
also
quite
modern,"
said
the
lady.
"Done
about
the
same
time
as
the
bell-rope?"
remarked
Holmes.
"Yes,
there
were
several
little
changes
carried
out
about
that
time."
"They
seem
to
have
been
of
a
most
interesting
character--dummy
bell-ropes,
and
ventilators
which
do
not
ventilate.
With
your
permission,
Miss
Stoner,
we
shall
now
carry
our
researches
into
the
inner
apartment."
Dr.
Grimesby
Roylott's
chamber
was
larger
than
that
of
his
step-daughter,
but
was
as
plainly
furnished.
A
camp-bed,
a
small
wooden
shelf
full
of
books,
mostly
of
a
technical
character,
an
armchair
beside
the
bed,
a
plain
wooden
chair
against
the
wall,
a
round
table,
and
a
large
iron
safe
were
the
principal
things
which
met
the
eye.
Holmes
walked
slowly
round
and
examined
each
and
all
of
them
with
the
keenest
interest.
"What's
in
here?"
he
asked,
tapping
the
safe.
"My
stepfather's
business
papers."
"Oh!
you
have
seen
inside,
then?"
"Only
once,
some
years
ago.
I
remember
that
it
was
full
of
papers."
"There
isn't
a
cat
in
it,
for
example?"
"No.
What
a
strange
idea!"
"Well,
look
at
this!"
He
took
up
a
small
saucer
of
milk
which
stood
on
the
top
of
it.
"No;
we
don't
keep
a
cat.
But
there
is
a
cheetah
and
a
baboon."
"Ah,
yes,
of
course!
Well,
a
cheetah
is
just
a
big
cat,
and
yet
a
saucer
of
milk
does
not
go
very
far
in
satisfying
its
wants,
I
daresay.
There
is
one
point
which
I
should
wish
to
determine."
He
squatted
down
in
front
of
the
wooden
chair
and
examined
the
seat
of
it
with
the
greatest
attention.
"Thank
you.
That
is
quite
settled,"
said
he,
rising
and
putting
his
lens
in
his
pocket.
"Hullo!
Here
is
something
interesting!"
The
object
which
had
caught
his
eye
was
a
small
dog
lash
hung
on
one
corner
of
the
bed.
The
lash,
however,
was
curled
upon
itself
and
tied
so
as
to
make
a
loop
of
whipcord.
"What
do
you
make
of
that,
Watson?"
"It's
a
common
enough
lash.
But
I
don't
know
why
it
should
be
tied."
"That
is
not
quite
so
common,
is
it?
Ah,
me!
it's
a
wicked
world,
and
when
a
clever
man
turns
his
brains
to
crime
it
is
the
worst
of
all.
I
think
that
I
have
seen
enough
now,
Miss
Stoner,
and
with
your
permission
we
shall
walk
out
upon
the
lawn."
I
had
never
seen
my
friend's
face
so
grim
or
his
brow
so
dark
as
it
was
when
we
turned
from
the
scene
of
this
investigation.
We
had
walked
several
times
up
and
down
the
lawn,
neither
Miss
Stoner
nor
myself
liking
to
break
in
upon
his
thoughts
before
he
roused
himself
from
his
reverie.
"It
is
very
essential,
Miss
Stoner,"
said
he,
"that
you
should
absolutely
follow
my
advice
in
every
respect."
"I
shall
most
certainly
do
so."
"The
matter
is
too
serious
for
any
hesitation.
Your
life
may
depend
upon
your
compliance."
"I
assure
you
that
I
am
in
your
hands."
"In
the
first
place,
both
my
friend
and
I
must
spend
the
night
in
your
room."
Both
Miss
Stoner
and
I
gazed
at
him
in
astonishment.
"Yes,
it
must
be
so.
Let
me
explain.
I
believe
that
that
is
the
village
inn
over
there?"
"Yes,
that
is
the
Crown."
"Very
good.
Your
windows
would
be
visible
from
there?"
"Certainly."
"You
must
confine
yourself
to
your
room,
on
pretence
of
a
headache,
when
your
stepfather
comes
back.
Then
when
you
hear
him
retire
for
the
night,
you
must
open
the
shutters
of
your
window,
undo
the
hasp,
put
your
lamp
there
as
a
signal
to
us,
and
then
withdraw
quietly
with
everything
which
you
are
likely
to
want
into
the
room
which
you
used
to
occupy.
I
have
no
doubt
that,
in
spite
of
the
repairs,
you
could
manage
there
for
one
night."
"Oh,
yes,
easily."
"The
rest
you
will
leave
in
our
hands."
"But
what
will
you
do?"
"We
shall
spend
the
night
in
your
room,
and
we
shall
investigate
the
cause
of
this
noise
which
has
disturbed
you."
"I
believe,
Mr.
Holmes,
that
you
have
already
made
up
your
mind,"
said
Miss
Stoner,
laying
her
hand
upon
my
companion's
sleeve.
"Perhaps
I
have."
"Then,
for
pity's
sake,
tell
me
what
was
the
cause
of
my
sister's
death."
"I
should
prefer
to
have
clearer
proofs
before
I
speak."
"You
can
at
least
tell
me
whether
my
own
thought
is
correct,
and
if
she
died
from
some
sudden
fright."
"No,
I
do
not
think
so.
I
think
that
there
was
probably
some
more
tangible
cause.
And
now,
Miss
Stoner,
we
must
leave
you
for
if
Dr.
Roylott
returned
and
saw
us
our
journey
would
be
in
vain.
Good-bye,
and
be
brave,
for
if
you
will
do
what
I
have
told
you,
you
may
rest
assured
that
we
shall
soon
drive
away
the
dangers
that
threaten
you."
Sherlock
Holmes
and
I
had
no
difficulty
in
engaging
a
bedroom
and
sitting-room
at
the
Crown
Inn.
They
were
on
the
upper
floor,
and
from
our
window
we
could
command
a
view
of
the
avenue
gate,
and
of
the
inhabited
wing
of
Stoke
Moran
Manor
House.
At
dusk
we
saw
Dr.
Grimesby
Roylott
drive
past,
his
huge
form
looming
up
beside
the
little
figure
of
the
lad
who
drove
him.
The
boy
had
some
slight
difficulty
in
undoing
the
heavy
iron
gates,
and
we
heard
the
hoarse
roar
of
the
doctor's
voice
and
saw
the
fury
with
which
he
shook
his
clinched
fists
at
him.
The
trap
drove
on,
and
a
few
minutes
later
we
saw
a
sudden
light
spring
up
among
the
trees
as
the
lamp
was
lit
in
one
of
the
sitting-rooms.
"Do
you
know,
Watson,"
said
Holmes
as
we
sat
together
in
the
gathering
darkness,
"I
have
really
some
scruples
as
to
taking
you
to-night.
There
is
a
distinct
element
of
danger."
"Can
I
be
of
assistance?"
"Your
presence
might
be
invaluable."
"Then
I
shall
certainly
come."
"It
is
very
kind
of
you."
"You
speak
of
danger.
You
have
evidently
seen
more
in
these
rooms
than
was
visible
to
me."
"No,
but
I
fancy
that
I
may
have
deduced
a
little
more.
I
imagine
that
you
saw
all
that
I
did."
"I
saw
nothing
remarkable
save
the
bell-rope,
and
what
purpose
that
could
answer
I
confess
is
more
than
I
can
imagine."
"You
saw
the
ventilator,
too?"
"Yes,
but
I
do
not
think
that
it
is
such
a
very
unusual
thing
to
have
a
small
opening
between
two
rooms.
It
was
so
small
that
a
rat
could
hardly
pass
through."
"I
knew
that
we
should
find
a
ventilator
before
ever
we
came
to
Stoke
Moran."
"My
dear
Holmes!"
"Oh,
yes,
I
did.
You
remember
in
her
statement
she
said
that
her
sister
could
smell
Dr.
Roylott's
cigar.
Now,
of
course
that
suggested
at
once
that
there
must
be
a
communication
between
the
two
rooms.
It
could
only
be
a
small
one,
or
it
would
have
been
remarked
upon
at
the
coroner's
inquiry.
I
deduced
a
ventilator."
"But
what
harm
can
there
be
in
that?"
"Well,
there
is
at
least
a
curious
coincidence
of
dates.
A
ventilator
is
made,
a
cord
is
hung,
and
a
lady
who
sleeps
in
the
bed
dies.
Does
not
that
strike
you?"
"I
cannot
as
yet
see
any
connection."
"Did
you
observe
anything
very
peculiar
about
that
bed?"
"No."
"It
was
clamped
to
the
floor.
Did
you
ever
see
a
bed
fastened
like
that
before?"
"I
cannot
say
that
I
have."
"The
lady
could
not
move
her
bed.
It
must
always
be
in
the
same
relative
position
to
the
ventilator
and
to
the
rope--or
so
we
may
call
it,
since
it
was
clearly
never
meant
for
a
bell-pull."
"Holmes,"
I
cried,
"I
seem
to
see
dimly
what
you
are
hinting
at.
We
are
only
just
in
time
to
prevent
some
subtle
and
horrible
crime."
"Subtle
enough
and
horrible
enough.
When
a
doctor
does
go
wrong
he
is
the
first
of
criminals.
He
has
nerve
and
he
has
knowledge.
Palmer
and
Pritchard
were
among
the
heads
of
their
profession.
This
man
strikes
even
deeper,
but
I
think,
Watson,
that
we
shall
be
able
to
strike
deeper
still.
But
we
shall
have
horrors
enough
before
the
night
is
over;
for
goodness'
sake
let
us
have
a
quiet
pipe
and
turn
our
minds
for
a
few
hours
to
something
more
cheerful."
About
nine
o'clock
the
light
among
the
trees
was
extinguished,
and
all
was
dark
in
the
direction
of
the
Manor
House.
Two
hours
passed
slowly
away,
and
then,
suddenly,
just
at
the
stroke
of
eleven,
a
single
bright
light
shone
out
right
in
front
of
us.
"That
is
our
signal,"
said
Holmes,
springing
to
his
feet;
"it
comes
from
the
middle
window."
As
we
passed
out
he
exchanged
a
few
words
with
the
landlord,
explaining
that
we
were
going
on
a
late
visit
to
an
acquaintance,
and
that
it
was
possible
that
we
might
spend
the
night
there.
A
moment
later
we
were
out
on
the
dark
road,
a
chill
wind
blowing
in
our
faces,
and
one
yellow
light
twinkling
in
front
of
us
through
the
gloom
to
guide
us
on
our
sombre
errand.
There
was
little
difficulty
in
entering
the
grounds,
for
unrepaired
breaches
gaped
in
the
old
park
wall.
Making
our
way
among
the
trees,
we
reached
the
lawn,
crossed
it,
and
were
about
to
enter
through
the
window
when
out
from
a
clump
of
laurel
bushes
there
darted
what
seemed
to
be
a
hideous
and
distorted
child,
who
threw
itself
upon
the
grass
with
writhing
limbs
and
then
ran
swiftly
across
the
lawn
into
the
darkness.
"My
God!"
I
whispered;
"did
you
see
it?"
Holmes
was
for
the
moment
as
startled
as
I.
His
hand
closed
like
a
vice
upon
my
wrist
in
his
agitation.
Then
he
broke
into
a
low
laugh
and
put
his
lips
to
my
ear.
"It
is
a
nice
household,"
he
murmured.
"That
is
the
baboon."
I
had
forgotten
the
strange
pets
which
the
doctor
affected.
There
was
a
cheetah,
too;
perhaps
we
might
find
it
upon
our
shoulders
at
any
moment.
I
confess
that
I
felt
easier
in
my
mind
when,
after
following
Holmes'
example
and
slipping
off
my
shoes,
I
found
myself
inside
the
bedroom.
My
companion
noiselessly
closed
the
shutters,
moved
the
lamp
onto
the
table,
and
cast
his
eyes
round
the
room.
All
was
as
we
had
seen
it
in
the
daytime.
Then
creeping
up
to
me
and
making
a
trumpet
of
his
hand,
he
whispered
into
my
ear
again
so
gently
that
it
was
all
that
I
could
do
to
distinguish
the
words:
"The
least
sound
would
be
fatal
to
our
plans."
I
nodded
to
show
that
I
had
heard.
"We
must
sit
without
light.
He
would
see
it
through
the
ventilator."
I
nodded
again.
"Do
not
go
asleep;
your
very
life
may
depend
upon
it.
Have
your
pistol
ready
in
case
we
should
need
it.
I
will
sit
on
the
side
of
the
bed,
and
you
in
that
chair."
I
took
out
my
revolver
and
laid
it
on
the
corner
of
the
table.
Holmes
had
brought
up
a
long
thin
cane,
and
this
he
placed
upon
the
bed
beside
him.
By
it
he
laid
the
box
of
matches
and
the
stump
of
a
candle.
Then
he
turned
down
the
lamp,
and
we
were
left
in
darkness.
How
shall
I
ever
forget
that
dreadful
vigil?
I
could
not
hear
a
sound,
not
even
the
drawing
of
a
breath,
and
yet
I
knew
that
my
companion
sat
open-eyed,
within
a
few
feet
of
me,
in
the
same
state
of
nervous
tension
in
which
I
was
myself.
The
shutters
cut
off
the
least
ray
of
light,
and
we
waited
in
absolute
darkness.
From
outside
came
the
occasional
cry
of
a
night-bird,
and
once
at
our
very
window
a
long
drawn
catlike
whine,
which
told
us
that
the
cheetah
was
indeed
at
liberty.
Far
away
we
could
hear
the
deep
tones
of
the
parish
clock,
which
boomed
out
every
quarter
of
an
hour.
How
long
they
seemed,
those
quarters!
Twelve
struck,
and
one
and
two
and
three,
and
still
we
sat
waiting
silently
for
whatever
might
befall.
Suddenly
there
was
the
momentary
gleam
of
a
light
up
in
the
direction
of
the
ventilator,
which
vanished
immediately,
but
was
succeeded
by
a
strong
smell
of
burning
oil
and
heated
metal.
Someone
in
the
next
room
had
lit
a
dark-lantern.
I
heard
a
gentle
sound
of
movement,
and
then
all
was
silent
once
more,
though
the
smell
grew
stronger.
For
half
an
hour
I
sat
with
straining
ears.
Then
suddenly
another
sound
became
audible--a
very
gentle,
soothing
sound,
like
that
of
a
small
jet
of
steam
escaping
continually
from
a
kettle.
The
instant
that
we
heard
it,
Holmes
sprang
from
the
bed,
struck
a
match,
and
lashed
furiously
with
his
cane
at
the
bell-pull.
"You
see
it,
Watson?"
he
yelled.
"You
see
it?"
But
I
saw
nothing.
At
the
moment
when
Holmes
struck
the
light
I
heard
a
low,
clear
whistle,
but
the
sudden
glare
flashing
into
my
weary
eyes
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
tell
what
it
was
at
which
my
friend
lashed
so
savagely.
I
could,
however,
see
that
his
face
was
deadly
pale
and
filled
with
horror
and
loathing.
He
had
ceased
to
strike
and
was
gazing
up
at
the
ventilator
when
suddenly
there
broke
from
the
silence
of
the
night
the
most
horrible
cry
to
which
I
have
ever
listened.
It
swelled
up
louder
and
louder,
a
hoarse
yell
of
pain
and
fear
and
anger
all
mingled
in
the
one
dreadful
shriek.
They
say
that
away
down
in
the
village,
and
even
in
the
distant
parsonage,
that
cry
raised
the
sleepers
from
their
beds.
It
struck
cold
to
our
hearts,
and
I
stood
gazing
at
Holmes,
and
he
at
me,
until
the
last
echoes
of
it
had
died
away
into
the
silence
from
which
it
rose.
"What
can
it
mean?"
I
gasped.
"It
means
that
it
is
all
over,"
Holmes
answered.
"And
perhaps,
after
all,
it
is
for
the
best.
Take
your
pistol,
and
we
will
enter
Dr.
Roylott's
room."
With
a
grave
face
he
lit
the
lamp
and
led
the
way
down
the
corridor.
Twice
he
struck
at
the
chamber
door
without
any
reply
from
within.
Then
he
turned
the
handle
and
entered,
I
at
his
heels,
with
the
cocked
pistol
in
my
hand.
It
was
a
singular
sight
which
met
our
eyes.
On
the
table
stood
a
dark-lantern
with
the
shutter
half
open,
throwing
a
brilliant
beam
of
light
upon
the
iron
safe,
the
door
of
which
was
ajar.
Beside
this
table,
on
the
wooden
chair,
sat
Dr.
Grimesby
Roylott
clad
in
a
long
grey
dressing-gown,
his
bare
ankles
protruding
beneath,
and
his
feet
thrust
into
red
heelless
Turkish
slippers.
Across
his
lap
lay
the
short
stock
with
the
long
lash
which
we
had
noticed
during
the
day.
His
chin
was
cocked
upward
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
in
a
dreadful,
rigid
stare
at
the
corner
of
the
ceiling.
Round
his
brow
he
had
a
peculiar
yellow
band,
with
brownish
speckles,
which
seemed
to
be
bound
tightly
round
his
head.
As
we
entered
he
made
neither
sound
nor
motion.
"The
band!
the
speckled
band!"
whispered
Holmes.
I
took
a
step
forward.
In
an
instant
his
strange
headgear
began
to
move,
and
there
reared
itself
from
among
his
hair
the
squat
diamond-shaped
head
and
puffed
neck
of
a
loathsome
serpent.
"It
is
a
swamp
adder!"
cried
Holmes;
"the
deadliest
snake
in
India.
He
has
died
within
ten
seconds
of
being
bitten.
Violence
does,
in
truth,
recoil
upon
the
violent,
and
the
schemer
falls
into
the
pit
which
he
digs
for
another.
Let
us
thrust
this
creature
back
into
its
den,
and
we
can
then
remove
Miss
Stoner
to
some
place
of
shelter
and
let
the
county
police
know
what
has
happened."
As
he
spoke
he
drew
the
dog-whip
swiftly
from
the
dead
man's
lap,
and
throwing
the
noose
round
the
reptile's
neck
he
drew
it
from
its
horrid
perch
and,
carrying
it
at
arm's
length,
threw
it
into
the
iron
safe,
which
he
closed
upon
it.
Such
are
the
true
facts
of
the
death
of
Dr.
Grimesby
Roylott,
of
Stoke
Moran.
It
is
not
necessary
that
I
should
prolong
a
narrative
which
has
already
run
to
too
great
a
length
by
telling
how
we
broke
the
sad
news
to
the
terrified
girl,
how
we
conveyed
her
by
the
morning
train
to
the
care
of
her
good
aunt
at
Harrow,
of
how
the
slow
process
of
official
inquiry
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
doctor
met
his
fate
while
indiscreetly
playing
with
a
dangerous
pet.
The
little
which
I
had
yet
to
learn
of
the
case
was
told
me
by
Sherlock
Holmes
as
we
travelled
back
next
day.
"I
had,"
said
he,
"come
to
an
entirely
erroneous
conclusion
which
shows,
my
dear
Watson,
how
dangerous
it
always
is
to
reason
from
insufficient
data.
The
presence
of
the
gipsies,
and
the
use
of
the
word
'band,'
which
was
used
by
the
poor
girl,
no
doubt,
to
explain
the
appearance
which
she
had
caught
a
hurried
glimpse
of
by
the
light
of
her
match,
were
sufficient
to
put
me
upon
an
entirely
wrong
scent.
I
can
only
claim
the
merit
that
I
instantly
reconsidered
my
position
when,
however,
it
became
clear
to
me
that
whatever
danger
threatened
an
occupant
of
the
room
could
not
come
either
from
the
window
or
the
door.
My
attention
was
speedily
drawn,
as
I
have
already
remarked
to
you,
to
this
ventilator,
and
to
the
bell-rope
which
hung
down
to
the
bed.
The
discovery
that
this
was
a
dummy,
and
that
the
bed
was
clamped
to
the
floor,
instantly
gave
rise
to
the
suspicion
that
the
rope
was
there
as
a
bridge
for
something
passing
through
the
hole
and
coming
to
the
bed.
The
idea
of
a
snake
instantly
occurred
to
me,
and
when
I
coupled
it
with
my
knowledge
that
the
doctor
was
furnished
with
a
supply
of
creatures
from
India,
I
felt
that
I
was
probably
on
the
right
track.
The
idea
of
using
a
form
of
poison
which
could
not
possibly
be
discovered
by
any
chemical
test
was
just
such
a
one
as
would
occur
to
a
clever
and
ruthless
man
who
had
had
an
Eastern
training.
The
rapidity
with
which
such
a
poison
would
take
effect
would
also,
from
his
point
of
view,
be
an
advantage.
It
would
be
a
sharp-eyed
coroner,
indeed,
who
could
distinguish
the
two
little
dark
punctures
which
would
show
where
the
poison
fangs
had
done
their
work.
Then
I
thought
of
the
whistle.
Of
course
he
must
recall
the
snake
before
the
morning
light
revealed
it
to
the
victim.
He
had
trained
it,
probably
by
the
use
of
the
milk
which
we
saw,
to
return
to
him
when
summoned.
He
would
put
it
through
this
ventilator
at
the
hour
that
he
thought
best,
with
the
certainty
that
it
would
crawl
down
the
rope
and
land
on
the
bed.
It
might
or
might
not
bite
the
occupant,
perhaps
she
might
escape
every
night
for
a
week,
but
sooner
or
later
she
must
fall
a
victim.
"I
had
come
to
these
conclusions
before
ever
I
had
entered
his
room.
An
inspection
of
his
chair
showed
me
that
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
standing
on
it,
which
of
course
would
be
necessary
in
order
that
he
should
reach
the
ventilator.
The
sight
of
the
safe,
the
saucer
of
milk,
and
the
loop
of
whipcord
were
enough
to
finally
dispel
any
doubts
which
may
have
remained.
The
metallic
clang
heard
by
Miss
Stoner
was
obviously
caused
by
her
stepfather
hastily
closing
the
door
of
his
safe
upon
its
terrible
occupant.
Having
once
made
up
my
mind,
you
know
the
steps
which
I
took
in
order
to
put
the
matter
to
the
proof.
I
heard
the
creature
hiss
as
I
have
no
doubt
that
you
did
also,
and
I
instantly
lit
the
light
and
attacked
it."
"With
the
result
of
driving
it
through
the
ventilator."
"And
also
with
the
result
of
causing
it
to
turn
upon
its
master
at
the
other
side.
Some
of
the
blows
of
my
cane
came
home
and
roused
its
snakish
temper,
so
that
it
flew
upon
the
first
person
it
saw.
In
this
way
I
am
no
doubt
indirectly
responsible
for
Dr.
Grimesby
Roylott's
death,
and
I
cannot
say
that
it
is
likely
to
weigh
very
heavily
upon
my
conscience."
IX.
THE
ADVENTURE
OF
THE
ENGINEER'S
THUMB
Of
all
the
problems
which
have
been
submitted
to
my
friend,
Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes,
for
solution
during
the
years
of
our
intimacy,
there
were
only
two
which
I
was
the
means
of
introducing
to
his
notice--that
of
Mr.
Hatherley's
thumb,
and
that
of
Colonel
Warburton's
madness.
Of
these
the
latter
may
have
afforded
a
finer
field
for
an
acute
and
original
observer,
but
the
other
was
so
strange
in
its
inception
and
so
dramatic
in
its
details
that
it
may
be
the
more
worthy
of
being
placed
upon
record,
even
if
it
gave
my
friend
fewer
openings
for
those
deductive
methods
of
reasoning
by
which
he
achieved
such
remarkable
results.
The
story
has,
I
believe,
been
told
more
than
once
in
the
newspapers,
but,
like
all
such
narratives,
its
effect
is
much
less
striking
when
set
forth
en
bloc
in
a
single
half-column
of
print
than
when
the
facts
slowly
evolve
before
your
own
eyes,
and
the
mystery
clears
gradually
away
as
each
new
discovery
furnishes
a
step
which
leads
on
to
the
complete
truth.
At
the
time
the
circumstances
made
a
deep
impression
upon
me,
and
the
lapse
of
two
years
has
hardly
served
to
weaken
the
effect.
It
was
in
the
summer
of
'89,
not
long
after
my
marriage,
that
the
events
occurred
which
I
am
now
about
to
summarise.
I
had
returned
to
civil
practice
and
had
finally
abandoned
Holmes
in
his
Baker
Street
rooms,
although
I
continually
visited
him
and
occasionally
even
persuaded
him
to
forgo
his
Bohemian
habits
so
far
as
to
come
and
visit
us.
My
practice
had
steadily
increased,
and
as
I
happened
to
live
at
no
very
great
distance
from
Paddington
Station,
I
got
a
few
patients
from
among
the
officials.
One
of
these,
whom
I
had
cured
of
a
painful
and
lingering
disease,
was
never
weary
of
advertising
my
virtues
and
of
endeavouring
to
send
me
on
every
sufferer
over
whom
he
might
have
any
influence.
One
morning,
at
a
little
before
seven
o'clock,
I
was
awakened
by
the
maid
tapping
at
the
door
to
announce
that
two
men
had
come
from
Paddington
and
were
waiting
in
the
consulting-room.
I
dressed
hurriedly,
for
I
knew
by
experience
that
railway
cases
were
seldom
trivial,
and
hastened
downstairs.
As
I
descended,
my
old
ally,
the
guard,
came
out
of
the
room
and
closed
the
door
tightly
behind
him.
"I've
got
him
here,"
he
whispered,
jerking
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder;
"he's
all
right."
"What
is
it,
then?"
I
asked,
for
his
manner
suggested
that
it
was
some
strange
creature
which
he
had
caged
up
in
my
room.
"It's
a
new
patient,"
he
whispered.
"I
thought
I'd
bring
him
round
myself;
then
he
couldn't
slip
away.
There
he
is,
all
safe
and
sound.
I
must
go
now,
Doctor;
I
have
my
dooties,
just
the
same
as
you."
And
off
he
went,
this
trusty
tout,
without
even
giving
me
time
to
thank
him.
I
entered
my
consulting-room
and
found
a
gentleman
seated
by
the
table.
He
was
quietly
dressed
in
a
suit
of
heather
tweed
with
a
soft
cloth
cap
which
he
had
laid
down
upon
my
books.
Round
one
of
his
hands
he
had
a
handkerchief
wrapped,
which
was
mottled
all
over
with
bloodstains.
He
was
young,
not
more
than
five-and-twenty,
I
should
say,
with
a
strong,
masculine
face;
but
he
was
exceedingly
pale
and
gave
me
the
impression
of
a
man
who
was
suffering
from
some
strong
agitation,
which
it
took
all
his
strength
of
mind
to
control.
"I
am
sorry
to
knock
you
up
so
early,
Doctor,"
said
he,
"but
I
have
had
a
very
serious
accident
during
the
night.
I
came
in
by
train
this
morning,
and
on
inquiring
at
Paddington
as
to
where
I
might
find
a
doctor,
a
worthy
fellow
very
kindly
escorted
me
here.
I
gave
the
maid
a
card,
but
I
see
that
she
has
left
it
upon
the
side-table."
I
took
it
up
and
glanced
at
it.
"Mr.
Victor
Hatherley,
hydraulic
engineer,
16A,
Victoria
Street
(3rd
floor)."
That
was
the
name,
style,
and
abode
of
my
morning
visitor.
"I
regret
that
I
have
kept
you
waiting,"
said
I,
sitting
down
in
my
library-chair.
"You
are
fresh
from
a
night
journey,
I
understand,
which
is
in
itself
a
monotonous
occupation."
"Oh,
my
night
could
not
be
called
monotonous,"
said
he,
and
laughed.
He
laughed
very
heartily,
with
a
high,
ringing
note,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
shaking
his
sides.
All
my
medical
instincts
rose
up
against
that
laugh.
"Stop
it!"
I
cried;
"pull
yourself
together!"
and
I
poured
out
some
water
from
a
caraffe.
It
was
useless,
however.
He
was
off
in
one
of
those
hysterical
outbursts
which
come
upon
a
strong
nature
when
some
great
crisis
is
over
and
gone.
Presently
he
came
to
himself
once
more,
very
weary
and
pale-looking.
"I
have
been
making
a
fool
of
myself,"
he
gasped.
"Not
at
all.
Drink
this."
I
dashed
some
brandy
into
the
water,
and
the
colour
began
to
come
back
to
his
bloodless
cheeks.
"That's
better!"
said
he.
"And
now,
Doctor,
perhaps
you
would
kindly
attend
to
my
thumb,
or
rather
to
the
place
where
my
thumb
used
to
be."
He
unwound
the
handkerchief
and
held
out
his
hand.
It
gave
even
my
hardened
nerves
a
shudder
to
look
at
it.
There
were
four
protruding
fingers
and
a
horrid
red,
spongy
surface
where
the
thumb
should
have
been.
It
had
been
hacked
or
torn
right
out
from
the
roots.
"Good
heavens!"
I
cried,
"this
is
a
terrible
injury.
It
must
have
bled
considerably."
"Yes,
it
did.
I
fainted
when
it
was
done,
and
I
think
that
I
must
have
been
senseless
for
a
long
time.
When
I
came
to
I
found
that
it
was
still
bleeding,
so
I
tied
one
end
of
my
handkerchief
very
tightly
round
the
wrist
and
braced
it
up
with
a
twig."
"Excellent!
You
should
have
been
a
surgeon."
"It
is
a
question
of
hydraulics,
you
see,
and
came
within
my
own
province."
"This
has
been
done,"
said
I,
examining
the
wound,
"by
a
very
heavy
and
sharp
instrument."
"A
thing
like
a
cleaver,"
said
he.
"An
accident,
I
presume?"
"By
no
means."
"What!
a
murderous
attack?"
"Very
murderous
indeed."
"You
horrify
me."
I
sponged
the
wound,
cleaned
it,
dressed
it,
and
finally
covered
it
over
with
cotton
wadding
and
carbolised
bandages.
He
lay
back
without
wincing,
though
he
bit
his
lip
from
time
to
time.
"How
is
that?"
I
asked
when
I
had
finished.
"Capital!
Between
your
brandy
and
your
bandage,
I
feel
a
new
man.
I
was
very
weak,
but
I
have
had
a
good
deal
to
go
through."
"Perhaps
you
had
better
not
speak
of
the
matter.
It
is
evidently
trying
to
your
nerves."
"Oh,
no,
not
now.
I
shall
have
to
tell
my
tale
to
the
police;
but,
between
ourselves,
if
it
were
not
for
the
convincing
evidence
of
this
wound
of
mine,
I
should
be
surprised
if
they
believed
my
statement,
for
it
is
a
very
extraordinary
one,
and
I
have
not
much
in
the
way
of
proof
with
which
to
back
it
up;
and,
even
if
they
believe
me,
the
clues
which
I
can
give
them
are
so
vague
that
it
is
a
question
whether
justice
will
be
done."
"Ha!"
cried
I,
"if
it
is
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
problem
which
you
desire
to
see
solved,
I
should
strongly
recommend
you
to
come
to
my
friend,
Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes,
before
you
go
to
the
official
police."
"Oh,
I
have
heard
of
that
fellow,"
answered
my
visitor,
"and
I
should
be
very
glad
if
he
would
take
the
matter
up,
though
of
course
I
must
use
the
official
police
as
well.
Would
you
give
me
an
introduction
to
him?"
"I'll
do
better.
I'll
take
you
round
to
him
myself."
"I
should
be
immensely
obliged
to
you."
"We'll
call
a
cab
and
go
together.
We
shall
just
be
in
time
to
have
a
little
breakfast
with
him.
Do
you
feel
equal
to
it?"
"Yes;
I
shall
not
feel
easy
until
I
have
told
my
story."
"Then
my
servant
will
call
a
cab,
and
I
shall
be
with
you
in
an
instant."
I
rushed
upstairs,
explained
the
matter
shortly
to
my
wife,
and
in
five
minutes
was
inside
a
hansom,
driving
with
my
new
acquaintance
to
Baker
Street.
Sherlock
Holmes
was,
as
I
expected,
lounging
about
his
sitting-room
in
his
dressing-gown,
reading
the
agony
column
of
The
Times
and
smoking
his
before-breakfast
pipe,
which
was
composed
of
all
the
plugs
and
dottles
left
from
his
smokes
of
the
day
before,
all
carefully
dried
and
collected
on
the
corner
of
the
mantelpiece.
He
received
us
in
his
quietly
genial
fashion,
ordered
fresh
rashers
and
eggs,
and
joined
us
in
a
hearty
meal.
When
it
was
concluded
he
settled
our
new
acquaintance
upon
the
sofa,
placed
a
pillow
beneath
his
head,
and
laid
a
glass
of
brandy
and
water
within
his
reach.
"It
is
easy
to
see
that
your
experience
has
been
no
common
one,
Mr.
Hatherley,"
said
he.
"Pray,
lie
down
there
and
make
yourself
absolutely
at
home.
Tell
us
what
you
can,
but
stop
when
you
are
tired
and
keep
up
your
strength
with
a
little
stimulant."
"Thank
you,"
said
my
patient,
"but
I
have
felt
another
man
since
the
doctor
bandaged
me,
and
I
think
that
your
breakfast
has
completed
the
cure.
I
shall
take
up
as
little
of
your
valuable
time
as
possible,
so
I
shall
start
at
once
upon
my
peculiar
experiences."
Holmes
sat
in
his
big
armchair
with
the
weary,
heavy-lidded
expression
which
veiled
his
keen
and
eager
nature,
while
I
sat
opposite
to
him,
and
we
listened
in
silence
to
the
strange
story
which
our
visitor
detailed
to
us.
"You
must
know,"
said
he,
"that
I
am
an
orphan
and
a
bachelor,
residing
alone
in
lodgings
in
London.
By
profession
I
am
a
hydraulic
engineer,
and
I
have
had
considerable
experience
of
my
work
during
the
seven
years
that
I
was
apprenticed
to
Venner
&
Matheson,
the
well-known
firm,
of
Greenwich.
Two
years
ago,
having
served
my
time,
and
having
also
come
into
a
fair
sum
of
money
through
my
poor
father's
death,
I
determined
to
start
in
business
for
myself
and
took
professional
chambers
in
Victoria
Street.
"I
suppose
that
everyone
finds
his
first
independent
start
in
business
a
dreary
experience.
To
me
it
has
been
exceptionally
so.
During
two
years
I
have
had
three
consultations
and
one
small
job,
and
that
is
absolutely
all
that
my
profession
has
brought
me.
My
gross
takings
amount
to
27
pounds
10s.
Every
day,
from
nine
in
the
morning
until
four
in
the
afternoon,
I
waited
in
my
little
den,
until
at
last
my
heart
began
to
sink,
and
I
came
to
believe
that
I
should
never
have
any
practice
at
all.
"Yesterday,
however,
just
as
I
was
thinking
of
leaving
the
office,
my
clerk
entered
to
say
there
was
a
gentleman
waiting
who
wished
to
see
me
upon
business.
He
brought
up
a
card,
too,
with
the
name
of
'Colonel
Lysander
Stark'
engraved
upon
it.
Close
at
his
heels
came
the
colonel
himself,
a
man
rather
over
the
middle
size,
but
of
an
exceeding
thinness.
I
do
not
think
that
I
have
ever
seen
so
thin
a
man.
His
whole
face
sharpened
away
into
nose
and
chin,
and
the
skin
of
his
cheeks
was
drawn
quite
tense
over
his
outstanding
bones.
Yet
this
emaciation
seemed
to
be
his
natural
habit,
and
due
to
no
disease,
for
his
eye
was
bright,
his
step
brisk,
and
his
bearing
assured.
He
was
plainly
but
neatly
dressed,
and
his
age,
I
should
judge,
would
be
nearer
forty
than
thirty.
"'Mr.
Hatherley?'
said
he,
with
something
of
a
German
accent.
'You
have
been
recommended
to
me,
Mr.
Hatherley,
as
being
a
man
who
is
not
only
proficient
in
his
profession
but
is
also
discreet
and
capable
of
preserving
a
secret.'
"I
bowed,
feeling
as
flattered
as
any
young
man
would
at
such
an
address.
'May
I
ask
who
it
was
who
gave
me
so
good
a
character?'
"'Well,
perhaps
it
is
better
that
I
should
not
tell
you
that
just
at
this
moment.
I
have
it
from
the
same
source
that
you
are
both
an
orphan
and
a
bachelor
and
are
residing
alone
in
London.'
"'That
is
quite
correct,'
I
answered;
'but
you
will
excuse
me
if
I
say
that
I
cannot
see
how
all
this
bears
upon
my
professional
qualifications.
I
understand
that
it
was
on
a
professional
matter
that
you
wished
to
speak
to
me?'
"'Undoubtedly
so.
But
you
will
find
that
all
I
say
is
really
to
the
point.
I
have
a
professional
commission
for
you,
but
absolute
secrecy
is
quite
essential--absolute
secrecy,
you
understand,
and
of
course
we
may
expect
that
more
from
a
man
who
is
alone
than
from
one
who
lives
in
the
bosom
of
his
family.'
"'If
I
promise
to
keep
a
secret,'
said
I,
'you
may
absolutely
depend
upon
my
doing
so.'
"He
looked
very
hard
at
me
as
I
spoke,
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
I
had
never
seen
so
suspicious
and
questioning
an
eye.
"'Do
you
promise,
then?'
said
he
at
last.
"'Yes,
I
promise.'
"'Absolute
and
complete
silence
before,
during,
and
after?
No
reference
to
the
matter
at
all,
either
in
word
or
writing?'
"'I
have
already
given
you
my
word.'
"'Very
good.'
He
suddenly
sprang
up,
and
darting
like
lightning
across
the
room
he
flung
open
the
door.
The
passage
outside
was
empty.
"'That's
all
right,'
said
he,
coming
back.
'I
know
that
clerks
are
sometimes
curious
as
to
their
master's
affairs.
Now
we
can
talk
in
safety.'
He
drew
up
his
chair
very
close
to
mine
and
began
to
stare
at
me
again
with
the
same
questioning
and
thoughtful
look.
"A
feeling
of
repulsion,
and
of
something
akin
to
fear
had
begun
to
rise
within
me
at
the
strange
antics
of
this
fleshless
man.
Even
my
dread
of
losing
a
client
could
not
restrain
me
from
showing
my
impatience.
"'I
beg
that
you
will
state
your
business,
sir,'
said
I;
'my
time
is
of
value.'
Heaven
forgive
me
for
that
last
sentence,
but
the
words
came
to
my
lips.
"'How
would
fifty
guineas
for
a
night's
work
suit
you?'
he
asked.
"'Most
admirably.'
"'I
say
a
night's
work,
but
an
hour's
would
be
nearer
the
mark.
I
simply
want
your
opinion
about
a
hydraulic
stamping
machine
which
has
got
out
of
gear.
If
you
show
us
what
is
wrong
we
shall
soon
set
it
right
ourselves.
What
do
you
think
of
such
a
commission
as
that?'
"'The
work
appears
to
be
light
and
the
pay
munificent.'
"'Precisely
so.
We
shall
want
you
to
come
to-night
by
the
last
train.'
"'Where
to?'
"'To
Eyford,
in
Berkshire.
It
is
a
little
place
near
the
borders
of
Oxfordshire,
and
within
seven
miles
of
Reading.
There
is
a
train
from
Paddington
which
would
bring
you
there
at
about
11:15.'
"'Very
good.'
"'I
shall
come
down
in
a
carriage
to
meet
you.'
"'There
is
a
drive,
then?'
"'Yes,
our
little
place
is
quite
out
in
the
country.
It
is
a
good
seven
miles
from
Eyford
Station.'
"'Then
we
can
hardly
get
there
before
midnight.
I
suppose
there
would
be
no
chance
of
a
train
back.
I
should
be
compelled
to
stop
the
night.'
"'Yes,
we
could
easily
give
you
a
shake-down.'
"'That
is
very
awkward.
Could
I
not
come
at
some
more
convenient
hour?'
"'We
have
judged
it
best
that
you
should
come
late.
It
is
to
recompense
you
for
any
inconvenience
that
we
are
paying
to
you,
a
young
and
unknown
man,
a
fee
which
would
buy
an
opinion
from
the
very
heads
of
your
profession.
Still,
of
course,
if
you
would
like
to
draw
out
of
the
business,
there
is
plenty
of
time
to
do
so.'
"I
thought
of
the
fifty
guineas,
and
of
how
very
useful
they
would
be
to
me.
'Not
at
all,'
said
I,
'I
shall
be
very
happy
to
accommodate
myself
to
your
wishes.
I
should
like,
however,
to
understand
a
little
more
clearly
what
it
is
that
you
wish
me
to
do.'
"'Quite
so.
It
is
very
natural
that
the
pledge
of
secrecy
which
we
have
exacted
from
you
should
have
aroused
your
curiosity.
I
have
no
wish
to
commit
you
to
anything
without
your
having
it
all
laid
before
you.
I
suppose
that
we
are
absolutely
safe
from
eavesdroppers?'
"'Entirely.'
"'Then
the
matter
stands
thus.
You
are
probably
aware
that
fuller's-earth
is
a
valuable
product,
and
that
it
is
only
found
in
one
or
two
places
in
England?'
"'I
have
heard
so.'
"'Some
little
time
ago
I
bought
a
small
place--a
very
small
place--within
ten
miles
of
Reading.
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
discover
that
there
was
a
deposit
of
fuller's-earth
in
one
of
my
fields.
On
examining
it,
however,
I
found
that
this
deposit
was
a
comparatively
small
one,
and
that
it
formed
a
link
between
two
very
much
larger
ones
upon
the
right
and
left--both
of
them,
however,
in
the
grounds
of
my
neighbours.
These
good
people
were
absolutely
ignorant
that
their
land
contained
that
which
was
quite
as
valuable
as
a
gold-mine.
Naturally,
it
was
to
my
interest
to
buy
their
land
before
they
discovered
its
true
value,
but
unfortunately
I
had
no
capital
by
which
I
could
do
this.
I
took
a
few
of
my
friends
into
the
secret,
however,
and
they
suggested
that
we
should
quietly
and
secretly
work
our
own
little
deposit
and
that
in
this
way
we
should
earn
the
money
which
would
enable
us
to
buy
the
neighbouring
fields.
This
we
have
now
been
doing
for
some
time,
and
in
order
to
help
us
in
our
operations
we
erected
a
hydraulic
press.
This
press,
as
I
have
already
explained,
has
got
out
of
order,
and
we
wish
your
advice
upon
the
subject.
We
guard
our
secret
very
jealously,
however,
and
if
it
once
became
known
that
we
had
hydraulic
engineers
coming
to
our
little
house,
it
would
soon
rouse
inquiry,
and
then,
if
the
facts
came
out,
it
would
be
good-bye
to
any
chance
of
getting
these
fields
and
carrying
out
our
plans.
That
is
why
I
have
made
you
promise
me
that
you
will
not
tell
a
human
being
that
you
are
going
to
Eyford
to-night.
I
hope
that
I
make
it
all
plain?'
"'I
quite
follow
you,'
said
I.
'The
only
point
which
I
could
not
quite
understand
was
what
use
you
could
make
of
a
hydraulic
press
in
excavating
fuller's-earth,
which,
as
I
understand,
is
dug
out
like
gravel
from
a
pit.'
"'Ah!'
said
he
carelessly,
'we
have
our
own
process.
We
compress
the
earth
into
bricks,
so
as
to
remove
them
without
revealing
what
they
are.
But
that
is
a
mere
detail.
I
have
taken
you
fully
into
my
confidence
now,
Mr.
Hatherley,
and
I
have
shown
you
how
I
trust
you.'
He
rose
as
he
spoke.
'I
shall
expect
you,
then,
at
Eyford
at
11:15.'
"'I
shall
certainly
be
there.'
"'And
not
a
word
to
a
soul.'
He
looked
at
me
with
a
last
long,
questioning
gaze,
and
then,
pressing
my
hand
in
a
cold,
dank
grasp,
he
hurried
from
the
room.
"Well,
when
I
came
to
think
it
all
over
in
cool
blood
I
was
very
much
astonished,
as
you
may
both
think,
at
this
sudden
commission
which
had
been
intrusted
to
me.
On
the
one
hand,
of
course,
I
was
glad,
for
the
fee
was
at
least
tenfold
what
I
should
have
asked
had
I
set
a
price
upon
my
own
services,
and
it
was
possible
that
this
order
might
lead
to
other
ones.
On
the
other
hand,
the
face
and
manner
of
my
patron
had
made
an
unpleasant
impression
upon
me,
and
I
could
not
think
that
his
explanation
of
the
fuller's-earth
was
sufficient
to
explain
the
necessity
for
my
coming
at
midnight,
and
his
extreme
anxiety
lest
I
should
tell
anyone
of
my
errand.
However,
I
threw
all
fears
to
the
winds,
ate
a
hearty
supper,
drove
to
Paddington,
and
started
off,
having
obeyed
to
the
letter
the
injunction
as
to
holding
my
tongue.
"At
Reading
I
had
to
change
not
only
my
carriage
but
my
station.
However,
I
was
in
time
for
the
last
train
to
Eyford,
and
I
reached
the
little
dim-lit
station
after
eleven
o'clock.
I
was
the
only
passenger
who
got
out
there,
and
there
was
no
one
upon
the
platform
save
a
single
sleepy
porter
with
a
lantern.
As
I
passed
out
through
the
wicket
gate,
however,
I
found
my
acquaintance
of
the
morning
waiting
in
the
shadow
upon
the
other
side.
Without
a
word
he
grasped
my
arm
and
hurried
me
into
a
carriage,
the
door
of
which
was
standing
open.
He
drew
up
the
windows
on
either
side,
tapped
on
the
wood-work,
and
away
we
went
as
fast
as
the
horse
could
go."
"One
horse?"
interjected
Holmes.
"Yes,
only
one."
"Did
you
observe
the
colour?"
"Yes,
I
saw
it
by
the
side-lights
when
I
was
stepping
into
the
carriage.
It
was
a
chestnut."
"Tired-looking
or
fresh?"
"Oh,
fresh
and
glossy."
"Thank
you.
I
am
sorry
to
have
interrupted
you.
Pray
continue
your
most
interesting
statement."
"Away
we
went
then,
and
we
drove
for
at
least
an
hour.
Colonel
Lysander
Stark
had
said
that
it
was
only
seven
miles,
but
I
should
think,
from
the
rate
that
we
seemed
to
go,
and
from
the
time
that
we
took,
that
it
must
have
been
nearer
twelve.
He
sat
at
my
side
in
silence
all
the
time,
and
I
was
aware,
more
than
once
when
I
glanced
in
his
direction,
that
he
was
looking
at
me
with
great
intensity.
The
country
roads
seem
to
be
not
very
good
in
that
part
of
the
world,
for
we
lurched
and
jolted
terribly.
I
tried
to
look
out
of
the
windows
to
see
something
of
where
we
were,
but
they
were
made
of
frosted
glass,
and
I
could
make
out
nothing
save
the
occasional
bright
blur
of
a
passing
light.
Now
and
then
I
hazarded
some
remark
to
break
the
monotony
of
the
journey,
but
the
colonel
answered
only
in
monosyllables,
and
the
conversation
soon
flagged.
At
last,
however,
the
bumping
of
the
road
was
exchanged
for
the
crisp
smoothness
of
a
gravel-drive,
and
the
carriage
came
to
a
stand.
Colonel
Lysander
Stark
sprang
out,
and,
as
I
followed
after
him,
pulled
me
swiftly
into
a
porch
which
gaped
in
front
of
us.
We
stepped,
as
it
were,
right
out
of
the
carriage
and
into
the
hall,
so
that
I
failed
to
catch
the
most
fleeting
glance
of
the
front
of
the
house.
The
instant
that
I
had
crossed
the
threshold
the
door
slammed
heavily
behind
us,
and
I
heard
faintly
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
as
the
carriage
drove
away.
"It
was
pitch
dark
inside
the
house,
and
the
colonel
fumbled
about
looking
for
matches
and
muttering
under
his
breath.
Suddenly
a
door
opened
at
the
other
end
of
the
passage,
and
a
long,
golden
bar
of
light
shot
out
in
our
direction.
It
grew
broader,
and
a
woman
appeared
with
a
lamp
in
her
hand,
which
she
held
above
her
head,
pushing
her
face
forward
and
peering
at
us.
I
could
see
that
she
was
pretty,
and
from
the
gloss
with
which
the
light
shone
upon
her
dark
dress
I
knew
that
it
was
a
rich
material.
She
spoke
a
few
words
in
a
foreign
tongue
in
a
tone
as
though
asking
a
question,
and
when
my
companion
answered
in
a
gruff
monosyllable
she
gave
such
a
start
that
the
lamp
nearly
fell
from
her
hand.
Colonel
Stark
went
up
to
her,
whispered
something
in
her
ear,
and
then,
pushing
her
back
into
the
room
from
whence
she
had
come,
he
walked
towards
me
again
with
the
lamp
in
his
hand.
"'Perhaps
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
wait
in
this
room
for
a
few
minutes,'
said
he,
throwing
open
another
door.
It
was
a
quiet,
little,
plainly
furnished
room,
with
a
round
table
in
the
centre,
on
which
several
German
books
were
scattered.
Colonel
Stark
laid
down
the
lamp
on
the
top
of
a
harmonium
beside
the
door.
'I
shall
not
keep
you
waiting
an
instant,'
said
he,
and
vanished
into
the
darkness.
"I
glanced
at
the
books
upon
the
table,
and
in
spite
of
my
ignorance
of
German
I
could
see
that
two
of
them
were
treatises
on
science,
the
others
being
volumes
of
poetry.
Then
I
walked
across
to
the
window,
hoping
that
I
might
catch
some
glimpse
of
the
country-side,
but
an
oak
shutter,
heavily
barred,
was
folded
across
it.
It
was
a
wonderfully
silent
house.
There
was
an
old
clock
ticking
loudly
somewhere
in
the
passage,
but
otherwise
everything
was
deadly
still.
A
vague
feeling
of
uneasiness
began
to
steal
over
me.
Who
were
these
German
people,
and
what
were
they
doing
living
in
this
strange,
out-of-the-way
place?
And
where
was
the
place?
I
was
ten
miles
or
so
from
Eyford,
that
was
all
I
knew,
but
whether
north,
south,
east,
or
west
I
had
no
idea.
For
that
matter,
Reading,
and
possibly
other
large
towns,
were
within
that
radius,
so
the
place
might
not
be
so
secluded,
after
all.
Yet
it
was
quite
certain,
from
the
absolute
stillness,
that
we
were
in
the
country.
I
paced
up
and
down
the
room,
humming
a
tune
under
my
breath
to
keep
up
my
spirits
and
feeling
that
I
was
thoroughly
earning
my
fifty-guinea
fee.
"Suddenly,
without
any
preliminary
sound
in
the
midst
of
the
utter
stillness,
the
door
of
my
room
swung
slowly
open.
The
woman
was
standing
in
the
aperture,
the
darkness
of
the
hall
behind
her,
the
yellow
light
from
my
lamp
beating
upon
her
eager
and
beautiful
face.
I
could
see
at
a
glance
that
she
was
sick
with
fear,
and
the
sight
sent
a
chill
to
my
own
heart.
She
held
up
one
shaking
finger
to
warn
me
to
be
silent,
and
she
shot
a
few
whispered
words
of
broken
English
at
me,
her
eyes
glancing
back,
like
those
of
a
frightened
horse,
into
the
gloom
behind
her.
"'I
would
go,'
said
she,
trying
hard,
as
it
seemed
to
me,
to
speak
calmly;
'I
would
go.
I
should
not
stay
here.
There
is
no
good
for
you
to
do.'
"'But,
madam,'
said
I,
'I
have
not
yet
done
what
I
came
for.
I
cannot
possibly
leave
until
I
have
seen
the
machine.'
"'It
is
not
worth
your
while
to
wait,'
she
went
on.
'You
can
pass
through
the
door;
no
one
hinders.'
And
then,
seeing
that
I
smiled
and
shook
my
head,
she
suddenly
threw
aside
her
constraint
and
made
a
step
forward,
with
her
hands
wrung
together.
'For
the
love
of
Heaven!'
she
whispered,
'get
away
from
here
before
it
is
too
late!'
"But
I
am
somewhat
headstrong
by
nature,
and
the
more
ready
to
engage
in
an
affair
when
there
is
some
obstacle
in
the
way.
I
thought
of
my
fifty-guinea
fee,
of
my
wearisome
journey,
and
of
the
unpleasant
night
which
seemed
to
be
before
me.
Was
it
all
to
go
for
nothing?
Why
should
I
slink
away
without
having
carried
out
my
commission,
and
without
the
payment
which
was
my
due?
This
woman
might,
for
all
I
knew,
be
a
monomaniac.
With
a
stout
bearing,
therefore,
though
her
manner
had
shaken
me
more
than
I
cared
to
confess,
I
still
shook
my
head
and
declared
my
intention
of
remaining
where
I
was.
She
was
about
to
renew
her
entreaties
when
a
door
slammed
overhead,
and
the
sound
of
several
footsteps
was
heard
upon
the
stairs.
She
listened
for
an
instant,
threw
up
her
hands
with
a
despairing
gesture,
and
vanished
as
suddenly
and
as
noiselessly
as
she
had
come.
"The
newcomers
were
Colonel
Lysander
Stark
and
a
short
thick
man
with
a
chinchilla
beard
growing
out
of
the
creases
of
his
double
chin,
who
was
introduced
to
me
as
Mr.
Ferguson.
"'This
is
my
secretary
and
manager,'
said
the
colonel.
'By
the
way,
I
was
under
the
impression
that
I
left
this
door
shut
just
now.
I
fear
that
you
have
felt
the
draught.'
"'On
the
contrary,'
said
I,
'I
opened
the
door
myself
because
I
felt
the
room
to
be
a
little
close.'
"He
shot
one
of
his
suspicious
looks
at
me.
'Perhaps
we
had
better
proceed
to
business,
then,'
said
he.
'Mr.
Ferguson
and
I
will
take
you
up
to
see
the
machine.'
"'I
had
better
put
my
hat
on,
I
suppose.'
"'Oh,
no,
it
is
in
the
house.'
"'What,
you
dig
fuller's-earth
in
the
house?'
"'No,
no.
This
is
only
where
we
compress
it.
But
never
mind
that.
All
we
wish
you
to
do
is
to
examine
the
machine
and
to
let
us
know
what
is
wrong
with
it.'
"We
went
upstairs
together,
the
colonel
first
with
the
lamp,
the
fat
manager
and
I
behind
him.
It
was
a
labyrinth
of
an
old
house,
with
corridors,
passages,
narrow
winding
staircases,
and
little
low
doors,
the
thresholds
of
which
were
hollowed
out
by
the
generations
who
had
crossed
them.
There
were
no
carpets
and
no
signs
of
any
furniture
above
the
ground
floor,
while
the
plaster
was
peeling
off
the
walls,
and
the
damp
was
breaking
through
in
green,
unhealthy
blotches.
I
tried
to
put
on
as
unconcerned
an
air
as
possible,
but
I
had
not
forgotten
the
warnings
of
the
lady,
even
though
I
disregarded
them,
and
I
kept
a
keen
eye
upon
my
two
companions.
Ferguson
appeared
to
be
a
morose
and
silent
man,
but
I
could
see
from
the
little
that
he
said
that
he
was
at
least
a
fellow-countryman.
"Colonel
Lysander
Stark
stopped
at
last
before
a
low
door,
which
he
unlocked.
Within
was
a
small,
square
room,
in
which
the
three
of
us
could
hardly
get
at
one
time.
Ferguson
remained
outside,
and
the
colonel
ushered
me
in.
"'We
are
now,'
said
he,
'actually
within
the
hydraulic
press,
and
it
would
be
a
particularly
unpleasant
thing
for
us
if
anyone
were
to
turn
it
on.
The
ceiling
of
this
small
chamber
is
really
the
end
of
the
descending
piston,
and
it
comes
down
with
the
force
of
many
tons
upon
this
metal
floor.
There
are
small
lateral
columns
of
water
outside
which
receive
the
force,
and
which
transmit
and
multiply
it
in
the
manner
which
is
familiar
to
you.
The
machine
goes
readily
enough,
but
there
is
some
stiffness
in
the
working
of
it,
and
it
has
lost
a
little
of
its
force.
Perhaps
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
look
it
over
and
to
show
us
how
we
can
set
it
right.'
"I
took
the
lamp
from
him,
and
I
examined
the
machine
very
thoroughly.
It
was
indeed
a
gigantic
one,
and
capable
of
exercising
enormous
pressure.
When
I
passed
outside,
however,
and
pressed
down
the
levers
which
controlled
it,
I
knew
at
once
by
the
whishing
sound
that
there
was
a
slight
leakage,
which
allowed
a
regurgitation
of
water
through
one
of
the
side
cylinders.
An
examination
showed
that
one
of
the
india-rubber
bands
which
was
round
the
head
of
a
driving-rod
had
shrunk
so
as
not
quite
to
fill
the
socket
along
which
it
worked.
This
was
clearly
the
cause
of
the
loss
of
power,
and
I
pointed
it
out
to
my
companions,
who
followed
my
remarks
very
carefully
and
asked
several
practical
questions
as
to
how
they
should
proceed
to
set
it
right.
When
I
had
made
it
clear
to
them,
I
returned
to
the
main
chamber
of
the
machine
and
took
a
good
look
at
it
to
satisfy
my
own
curiosity.
It
was
obvious
at
a
glance
that
the
story
of
the
fuller's-earth
was
the
merest
fabrication,
for
it
would
be
absurd
to
suppose
that
so
powerful
an
engine
could
be
designed
for
so
inadequate
a
purpose.
The
walls
were
of
wood,
but
the
floor
consisted
of
a
large
iron
trough,
and
when
I
came
to
examine
it
I
could
see
a
crust
of
metallic
deposit
all
over
it.
I
had
stooped
and
was
scraping
at
this
to
see
exactly
what
it
was
when
I
heard
a
muttered
exclamation
in
German
and
saw
the
cadaverous
face
of
the
colonel
looking
down
at
me.
"'What
are
you
doing
there?'
he
asked.
"I
felt
angry
at
having
been
tricked
by
so
elaborate
a
story
as
that
which
he
had
told
me.
'I
was
admiring
your
fuller's-earth,'
said
I;
'I
think
that
I
should
be
better
able
to
advise
you
as
to
your
machine
if
I
knew
what
the
exact
purpose
was
for
which
it
was
used.'
"The
instant
that
I
uttered
the
words
I
regretted
the
rashness
of
my
speech.
His
face
set
hard,
and
a
baleful
light
sprang
up
in
his
grey
eyes.
"'Very
well,'
said
he,
'you
shall
know
all
about
the
machine.'
He
took
a
step
backward,
slammed
the
little
door,
and
turned
the
key
in
the
lock.
I
rushed
towards
it
and
pulled
at
the
handle,
but
it
was
quite
secure,
and
did
not
give
in
the
least
to
my
kicks
and
shoves.
'Hullo!'
I
yelled.
'Hullo!
Colonel!
Let
me
out!'
"And
then
suddenly
in
the
silence
I
heard
a
sound
which
sent
my
heart
into
my
mouth.
It
was
the
clank
of
the
levers
and
the
swish
of
the
leaking
cylinder.
He
had
set
the
engine
at
work.
The
lamp
still
stood
upon
the
floor
where
I
had
placed
it
when
examining
the
trough.
By
its
light
I
saw
that
the
black
ceiling
was
coming
down
upon
me,
slowly,
jerkily,
but,
as
none
knew
better
than
myself,
with
a
force
which
must
within
a
minute
grind
me
to
a
shapeless
pulp.
I
threw
myself,
screaming,
against
the
door,
and
dragged
with
my
nails
at
the
lock.
I
implored
the
colonel
to
let
me
out,
but
the
remorseless
clanking
of
the
levers
drowned
my
cries.
The
ceiling
was
only
a
foot
or
two
above
my
head,
and
with
my
hand
upraised
I
could
feel
its
hard,
rough
surface.
Then
it
flashed
through
my
mind
that
the
pain
of
my
death
would
depend
very
much
upon
the
position
in
which
I
met
it.
If
I
lay
on
my
face
the
weight
would
come
upon
my
spine,
and
I
shuddered
to
think
of
that
dreadful
snap.
Easier
the
other
way,
perhaps;
and
yet,
had
I
the
nerve
to
lie
and
look
up
at
that
deadly
black
shadow
wavering
down
upon
me?
Already
I
was
unable
to
stand
erect,
when
my
eye
caught
something
which
brought
a
gush
of
hope
back
to
my
heart.
"I
have
said
that
though
the
floor
and
ceiling
were
of
iron,
the
walls
were
of
wood.
As
I
gave
a
last
hurried
glance
around,
I
saw
a
thin
line
of
yellow
light
between
two
of
the
boards,
which
broadened
and
broadened
as
a
small
panel
was
pushed
backward.
For
an
instant
I
could
hardly
believe
that
here
was
indeed
a
door
which
led
away
from
death.
The
next
instant
I
threw
myself
through,
and
lay
half-fainting
upon
the
other
side.
The
panel
had
closed
again
behind
me,
but
the
crash
of
the
lamp,
and
a
few
moments
afterwards
the
clang
of
the
two
slabs
of
metal,
told
me
how
narrow
had
been
my
escape.
"I
was
recalled
to
myself
by
a
frantic
plucking
at
my
wrist,
and
I
found
myself
lying
upon
the
stone
floor
of
a
narrow
corridor,
while
a
woman
bent
over
me
and
tugged
at
me
with
her
left
hand,
while
she
held
a
candle
in
her
right.
It
was
the
same
good
friend
whose
warning
I
had
so
foolishly
rejected.
"'Come!
come!'
she
cried
breathlessly.
'They
will
be
here
in
a
moment.
They
will
see
that
you
are
not
there.
Oh,
do
not
waste
the
so-precious
time,
but
come!'
"This
time,
at
least,
I
did
not
scorn
her
advice.
I
staggered
to
my
feet
and
ran
with
her
along
the
corridor
and
down
a
winding
stair.
The
latter
led
to
another
broad
passage,
and
just
as
we
reached
it
we
heard
the
sound
of
running
feet
and
the
shouting
of
two
voices,
one
answering
the
other
from
the
floor
on
which
we
were
and
from
the
one
beneath.
My
guide
stopped
and
looked
about
her
like
one
who
is
at
her
wit's
end.
Then
she
threw
open
a
door
which
led
into
a
bedroom,
through
the
window
of
which
the
moon
was
shining
brightly.
"'It
is
your
only
chance,'
said
she.
'It
is
high,
but
it
may
be
that
you
can
jump
it.'
"As
she
spoke
a
light
sprang
into
view
at
the
further
end
of
the
passage,
and
I
saw
the
lean
figure
of
Colonel
Lysander
Stark
rushing
forward
with
a
lantern
in
one
hand
and
a
weapon
like
a
butcher's
cleaver
in
the
other.
I
rushed
across
the
bedroom,
flung
open
the
window,
and
looked
out.
How
quiet
and
sweet
and
wholesome
the
garden
looked
in
the
moonlight,
and
it
could
not
be
more
than
thirty
feet
down.
I
clambered
out
upon
the
sill,
but
I
hesitated
to
jump
until
I
should
have
heard
what
passed
between
my
saviour
and
the
ruffian
who
pursued
me.
If
she
were
ill-used,
then
at
any
risks
I
was
determined
to
go
back
to
her
assistance.
The
thought
had
hardly
flashed
through
my
mind
before
he
was
at
the
door,
pushing
his
way
past
her;
but
she
threw
her
arms
round
him
and
tried
to
hold
him
back.
"'Fritz!
Fritz!'
she
cried
in
English,
'remember
your
promise
after
the
last
time.
You
said
it
should
not
be
again.
He
will
be
silent!
Oh,
he
will
be
silent!'
"'You
are
mad,
Elise!'
he
shouted,
struggling
to
break
away
from
her.
'You
will
be
the
ruin
of
us.
He
has
seen
too
much.
Let
me
pass,
I
say!'
He
dashed
her
to
one
side,
and,
rushing
to
the
window,
cut
at
me
with
his
heavy
weapon.
I
had
let
myself
go,
and
was
hanging
by
the
hands
to
the
sill,
when
his
blow
fell.
I
was
conscious
of
a
dull
pain,
my
grip
loosened,
and
I
fell
into
the
garden
below.
"I
was
shaken
but
not
hurt
by
the
fall;
so
I
picked
myself
up
and
rushed
off
among
the
bushes
as
hard
as
I
could
run,
for
I
understood
that
I
was
far
from
being
out
of
danger
yet.
Suddenly,
however,
as
I
ran,
a
deadly
dizziness
and
sickness
came
over
me.
I
glanced
down
at
my
hand,
which
was
throbbing
painfully,
and
then,
for
the
first
time,
saw
that
my
thumb
had
been
cut
off
and
that
the
blood
was
pouring
from
my
wound.
I
endeavoured
to
tie
my
handkerchief
round
it,
but
there
came
a
sudden
buzzing
in
my
ears,
and
next
moment
I
fell
in
a
dead
faint
among
the
rose-bushes.
"How
long
I
remained
unconscious
I
cannot
tell.
It
must
have
been
a
very
long
time,
for
the
moon
had
sunk,
and
a
bright
morning
was
breaking
when
I
came
to
myself.
My
clothes
were
all
sodden
with
dew,
and
my
coat-sleeve
was
drenched
with
blood
from
my
wounded
thumb.
The
smarting
of
it
recalled
in
an
instant
all
the
particulars
of
my
night's
adventure,
and
I
sprang
to
my
feet
with
the
feeling
that
I
might
hardly
yet
be
safe
from
my
pursuers.
But
to
my
astonishment,
when
I
came
to
look
round
me,
neither
house
nor
garden
were
to
be
seen.
I
had
been
lying
in
an
angle
of
the
hedge
close
by
the
highroad,
and
just
a
little
lower
down
was
a
long
building,
which
proved,
upon
my
approaching
it,
to
be
the
very
station
at
which
I
had
arrived
upon
the
previous
night.
Were
it
not
for
the
ugly
wound
upon
my
hand,
all
that
had
passed
during
those
dreadful
hours
might
have
been
an
evil
dream.
"Half
dazed,
I
went
into
the
station
and
asked
about
the
morning
train.
There
would
be
one
to
Reading
in
less
than
an
hour.
The
same
porter
was
on
duty,
I
found,
as
had
been
there
when
I
arrived.
I
inquired
of
him
whether
he
had
ever
heard
of
Colonel
Lysander
Stark.
The
name
was
strange
to
him.
Had
he
observed
a
carriage
the
night
before
waiting
for
me?
No,
he
had
not.
Was
there
a
police-station
anywhere
near?
There
was
one
about
three
miles
off.
"It
was
too
far
for
me
to
go,
weak
and
ill
as
I
was.
I
determined
to
wait
until
I
got
back
to
town
before
telling
my
story
to
the
police.
It
was
a
little
past
six
when
I
arrived,
so
I
went
first
to
have
my
wound
dressed,
and
then
the
doctor
was
kind
enough
to
bring
me
along
here.
I
put
the
case
into
your
hands
and
shall
do
exactly
what
you
advise."
We
both
sat
in
silence
for
some
little
time
after
listening
to
this
extraordinary
narrative.
Then
Sherlock
Holmes
pulled
down
from
the
shelf
one
of
the
ponderous
commonplace
books
in
which
he
placed
his
cuttings.
"Here
is
an
advertisement
which
will
interest
you,"
said
he.
"It
appeared
in
all
the
papers
about
a
year
ago.
Listen
to
this:
'Lost,
on
the
9th
inst.,
Mr.
Jeremiah
Hayling,
aged
twenty-six,
a
hydraulic
engineer.
Left
his
lodgings
at
ten
o'clock
at
night,
and
has
not
been
heard
of
since.
Was
dressed
in,'
etc.,
etc.
Ha!
That
represents
the
last
time
that
the
colonel
needed
to
have
his
machine
overhauled,
I
fancy."
"Good
heavens!"
cried
my
patient.
"Then
that
explains
what
the
girl
said."
"Undoubtedly.
It
is
quite
clear
that
the
colonel
was
a
cool
and
desperate
man,
who
was
absolutely
determined
that
nothing
should
stand
in
the
way
of
his
little
game,
like
those
out-and-out
pirates
who
will
leave
no
survivor
from
a
captured
ship.
Well,
every
moment
now
is
precious,
so
if
you
feel
equal
to
it
we
shall
go
down
to
Scotland
Yard
at
once
as
a
preliminary
to
starting
for
Eyford."
Some
three
hours
or
so
afterwards
we
were
all
in
the
train
together,
bound
from
Reading
to
the
little
Berkshire
village.
There
were
Sherlock
Holmes,
the
hydraulic
engineer,
Inspector
Bradstreet,
of
Scotland
Yard,
a
plain-clothes
man,
and
myself.
Bradstreet
had
spread
an
ordnance
map
of
the
county
out
upon
the
seat
and
was
busy
with
his
compasses
drawing
a
circle
with
Eyford
for
its
centre.
"There
you
are,"
said
he.
"That
circle
is
drawn
at
a
radius
of
ten
miles
from
the
village.
The
place
we
want
must
be
somewhere
near
that
line.
You
said
ten
miles,
I
think,
sir."
"It
was
an
hour's
good
drive."
"And
you
think
that
they
brought
you
back
all
that
way
when
you
were
unconscious?"
"They
must
have
done
so.
I
have
a
confused
memory,
too,
of
having
been
lifted
and
conveyed
somewhere."
"What
I
cannot
understand,"
said
I,
"is
why
they
should
have
spared
you
when
they
found
you
lying
fainting
in
the
garden.
Perhaps
the
villain
was
softened
by
the
woman's
entreaties."
"I
hardly
think
that
likely.
I
never
saw
a
more
inexorable
face
in
my
life."
"Oh,
we
shall
soon
clear
up
all
that,"
said
Bradstreet.
"Well,
I
have
drawn
my
circle,
and
I
only
wish
I
knew
at
what
point
upon
it
the
folk
that
we
are
in
search
of
are
to
be
found."
"I
think
I
could
lay
my
finger
on
it,"
said
Holmes
quietly.
"Really,
now!"
cried
the
inspector,
"you
have
formed
your
opinion!
Come,
now,
we
shall
see
who
agrees
with
you.
I
say
it
is
south,
for
the
country
is
more
deserted
there."
"And
I
say
east,"
said
my
patient.
"I
am
for
west,"
remarked
the
plain-clothes
man.
"There
are
several
quiet
little
villages
up
there."
"And
I
am
for
north,"
said
I,
"because
there
are
no
hills
there,
and
our
friend
says
that
he
did
not
notice
the
carriage
go
up
any."
"Come,"
cried
the
inspector,
laughing;
"it's
a
very
pretty
diversity
of
opinion.
We
have
boxed
the
compass
among
us.
Who
do
you
give
your
casting
vote
to?"
"You
are
all
wrong."
"But
we
can't
all
be."
"Oh,
yes,
you
can.
This
is
my
point."
He
placed
his
finger
in
the
centre
of
the
circle.
"This
is
where
we
shall
find
them."
"But
the
twelve-mile
drive?"
gasped
Hatherley.
"Six
out
and
six
back.
Nothing
simpler.
You
say
yourself
that
the
horse
was
fresh
and
glossy
when
you
got
in.
How
could
it
be
that
if
it
had
gone
twelve
miles
over
heavy
roads?"
"Indeed,
it
is
a
likely
ruse
enough,"
observed
Bradstreet
thoughtfully.
"Of
course
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
nature
of
this
gang."
"None
at
all,"
said
Holmes.
"They
are
coiners
on
a
large
scale,
and
have
used
the
machine
to
form
the
amalgam
which
has
taken
the
place
of
silver."
"We
have
known
for
some
time
that
a
clever
gang
was
at
work,"
said
the
inspector.
"They
have
been
turning
out
half-crowns
by
the
thousand.
We
even
traced
them
as
far
as
Reading,
but
could
get
no
farther,
for
they
had
covered
their
traces
in
a
way
that
showed
that
they
were
very
old
hands.
But
now,
thanks
to
this
lucky
chance,
I
think
that
we
have
got
them
right
enough."
But
the
inspector
was
mistaken,
for
those
criminals
were
not
destined
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
justice.
As
we
rolled
into
Eyford
Station
we
saw
a
gigantic
column
of
smoke
which
streamed
up
from
behind
a
small
clump
of
trees
in
the
neighbourhood
and
hung
like
an
immense
ostrich
feather
over
the
landscape.
"A
house
on
fire?"
asked
Bradstreet
as
the
train
steamed
off
again
on
its
way.
"Yes,
sir!"
said
the
station-master.
"When
did
it
break
out?"
"I
hear
that
it
was
during
the
night,
sir,
but
it
has
got
worse,
and
the
whole
place
is
in
a
blaze."
"Whose
house
is
it?"
"Dr.
Becher's."
"Tell
me,"
broke
in
the
engineer,
"is
Dr.
Becher
a
German,
very
thin,
with
a
long,
sharp
nose?"
The
station-master
laughed
heartily.
"No,
sir,
Dr.
Becher
is
an
Englishman,
and
there
isn't
a
man
in
the
parish
who
has
a
better-lined
waistcoat.
But
he
has
a
gentleman
staying
with
him,
a
patient,
as
I
understand,
who
is
a
foreigner,
and
he
looks
as
if
a
little
good
Berkshire
beef
would
do
him
no
harm."
The
station-master
had
not
finished
his
speech
before
we
were
all
hastening
in
the
direction
of
the
fire.
The
road
topped
a
low
hill,
and
there
was
a
great
widespread
whitewashed
building
in
front
of
us,
spouting
fire
at
every
chink
and
window,
while
in
the
garden
in
front
three
fire-engines
were
vainly
striving
to
keep
the
flames
under.
"That's
it!"
cried
Hatherley,
in
intense
excitement.
"There
is
the
gravel-drive,
and
there
are
the
rose-bushes
where
I
lay.
That
second
window
is
the
one
that
I
jumped
from."
"Well,
at
least,"
said
Holmes,
"you
have
had
your
revenge
upon
them.
There
can
be
no
question
that
it
was
your
oil-lamp
which,
when
it
was
crushed
in
the
press,
set
fire
to
the
wooden
walls,
though
no
doubt
they
were
too
excited
in
the
chase
after
you
to
observe
it
at
the
time.
Now
keep
your
eyes
open
in
this
crowd
for
your
friends
of
last
night,
though
I
very
much
fear
that
they
are
a
good
hundred
miles
off
by
now."
And
Holmes'
fears
came
to
be
realised,
for
from
that
day
to
this
no
word
has
ever
been
heard
either
of
the
beautiful
woman,
the
sinister
German,
or
the
morose
Englishman.
Early
that
morning
a
peasant
had
met
a
cart
containing
several
people
and
some
very
bulky
boxes
driving
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
Reading,
but
there
all
traces
of
the
fugitives
disappeared,
and
even
Holmes'
ingenuity
failed
ever
to
discover
the
least
clue
as
to
their
whereabouts.
The
firemen
had
been
much
perturbed
at
the
strange
arrangements
which
they
had
found
within,
and
still
more
so
by
discovering
a
newly
severed
human
thumb
upon
a
window-sill
of
the
second
floor.
About
sunset,
however,
their
efforts
were
at
last
successful,
and
they
subdued
the
flames,
but
not
before
the
roof
had
fallen
in,
and
the
whole
place
been
reduced
to
such
absolute
ruin
that,
save
some
twisted
cylinders
and
iron
piping,
not
a
trace
remained
of
the
machinery
which
had
cost
our
unfortunate
acquaintance
so
dearly.
Large
masses
of
nickel
and
of
tin
were
discovered
stored
in
an
out-house,
but
no
coins
were
to
be
found,
which
may
have
explained
the
presence
of
those
bulky
boxes
which
have
been
already
referred
to.
How
our
hydraulic
engineer
had
been
conveyed
from
the
garden
to
the
spot
where
he
recovered
his
senses
might
have
remained
forever
a
mystery
were
it
not
for
the
soft
mould,
which
told
us
a
very
plain
tale.
He
had
evidently
been
carried
down
by
two
persons,
one
of
whom
had
remarkably
small
feet
and
the
other
unusually
large
ones.
On
the
whole,
it
was
most
probable
that
the
silent
Englishman,
being
less
bold
or
less
murderous
than
his
companion,
had
assisted
the
woman
to
bear
the
unconscious
man
out
of
the
way
of
danger.
"Well,"
said
our
engineer
ruefully
as
we
took
our
seats
to
return
once
more
to
London,
"it
has
been
a
pretty
business
for
me!
I
have
lost
my
thumb
and
I
have
lost
a
fifty-guinea
fee,
and
what
have
I
gained?"
"Experience,"
said
Holmes,
laughing.
"Indirectly
it
may
be
of
value,
you
know;
you
have
only
to
put
it
into
words
to
gain
the
reputation
of
being
excellent
company
for
the
remainder
of
your
existence."
X.
THE
ADVENTURE
OF
THE
NOBLE
BACHELOR
The
Lord
St.
Simon
marriage,
and
its
curious
termination,
have
long
ceased
to
be
a
subject
of
interest
in
those
exalted
circles
in
which
the
unfortunate
bridegroom
moves.
Fresh
scandals
have
eclipsed
it,
and
their
more
piquant
details
have
drawn
the
gossips
away
from
this
four-year-old
drama.
As
I
have
reason
to
believe,
however,
that
the
full
facts
have
never
been
revealed
to
the
general
public,
and
as
my
friend
Sherlock
Holmes
had
a
considerable
share
in
clearing
the
matter
up,
I
feel
that
no
memoir
of
him
would
be
complete
without
some
little
sketch
of
this
remarkable
episode.
It
was
a
few
weeks
before
my
own
marriage,
during
the
days
when
I
was
still
sharing
rooms
with
Holmes
in
Baker
Street,
that
he
came
home
from
an
afternoon
stroll
to
find
a
letter
on
the
table
waiting
for
him.
I
had
remained
indoors
all
day,
for
the
weather
had
taken
a
sudden
turn
to
rain,
with
high
autumnal
winds,
and
the
Jezail
bullet
which
I
had
brought
back
in
one
of
my
limbs
as
a
relic
of
my
Afghan
campaign
throbbed
with
dull
persistence.
With
my
body
in
one
easy-chair
and
my
legs
upon
another,
I
had
surrounded
myself
with
a
cloud
of
newspapers
until
at
last,
saturated
with
the
news
of
the
day,
I
tossed
them
all
aside
and
lay
listless,
watching
the
huge
crest
and
monogram
upon
the
envelope
upon
the
table
and
wondering
lazily
who
my
friend's
noble
correspondent
could
be.
"Here
is
a
very
fashionable
epistle,"
I
remarked
as
he
entered.
"Your
morning
letters,
if
I
remember
right,
were
from
a
fish-monger
and
a
tide-waiter."
"Yes,
my
correspondence
has
certainly
the
charm
of
variety,"
he
answered,
smiling,
"and
the
humbler
are
usually
the
more
interesting.
This
looks
like
one
of
those
unwelcome
social
summonses
which
call
upon
a
man
either
to
be
bored
or
to
lie."
He
broke
the
seal
and
glanced
over
the
contents.
"Oh,
come,
it
may
prove
to
be
something
of
interest,
after
all."
"Not
social,
then?"
"No,
distinctly
professional."
"And
from
a
noble
client?"
"One
of
the
highest
in
England."
"My
dear
fellow,
I
congratulate
you."
"I
assure
you,
Watson,
without
affectation,
that
the
status
of
my
client
is
a
matter
of
less
moment
to
me
than
the
interest
of
his
case.
It
is
just
possible,
however,
that
that
also
may
not
be
wanting
in
this
new
investigation.
You
have
been
reading
the
papers
diligently
of
late,
have
you
not?"
"It
looks
like
it,"
said
I
ruefully,
pointing
to
a
huge
bundle
in
the
corner.
"I
have
had
nothing
else
to
do."
"It
is
fortunate,
for
you
will
perhaps
be
able
to
post
me
up.
I
read
nothing
except
the
criminal
news
and
the
agony
column.
The
latter
is
always
instructive.
But
if
you
have
followed
recent
events
so
closely
you
must
have
read
about
Lord
St.
Simon
and
his
wedding?"
"Oh,
yes,
with
the
deepest
interest."
"That
is
well.
The
letter
which
I
hold
in
my
hand
is
from
Lord
St.
Simon.
I
will
read
it
to
you,
and
in
return
you
must
turn
over
these
papers
and
let
me
have
whatever
bears
upon
the
matter.
This
is
what
he
says:
"'MY
DEAR
MR.
SHERLOCK
HOLMES:--Lord
Backwater
tells
me
that
I
may
place
implicit
reliance
upon
your
judgment
and
discretion.
I
have
determined,
therefore,
to
call
upon
you
and
to
consult
you
in
reference
to
the
very
painful
event
which
has
occurred
in
connection
with
my
wedding.
Mr.
Lestrade,
of
Scotland
Yard,
is
acting
already
in
the
matter,
but
he
assures
me
that
he
sees
no
objection
to
your
co-operation,
and
that
he
even
thinks
that
it
might
be
of
some
assistance.
I
will
call
at
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon,
and,
should
you
have
any
other
engagement
at
that
time,
I
hope
that
you
will
postpone
it,
as
this
matter
is
of
paramount
importance.
Yours
faithfully,
ST.
SIMON.'
"It
is
dated
from
Grosvenor
Mansions,
written
with
a
quill
pen,
and
the
noble
lord
has
had
the
misfortune
to
get
a
smear
of
ink
upon
the
outer
side
of
his
right
little
finger,"
remarked
Holmes
as
he
folded
up
the
epistle.
"He
says
four
o'clock.
It
is
three
now.
He
will
be
here
in
an
hour."
"Then
I
have
just
time,
with
your
assistance,
to
get
clear
upon
the
subject.
Turn
over
those
papers
and
arrange
the
extracts
in
their
order
of
time,
while
I
take
a
glance
as
to
who
our
client
is."
He
picked
a
red-covered
volume
from
a
line
of
books
of
reference
beside
the
mantelpiece.
"Here
he
is,"
said
he,
sitting
down
and
flattening
it
out
upon
his
knee.
"'Lord
Robert
Walsingham
de
Vere
St.
Simon,
second
son
of
the
Duke
of
Balmoral.'
Hum!
'Arms:
Azure,
three
caltrops
in
chief
over
a
fess
sable.
Born
in
1846.'
He's
forty-one
years
of
age,
which
is
mature
for
marriage.
Was
Under-Secretary
for
the
colonies
in
a
late
administration.
The
Duke,
his
father,
was
at
one
time
Secretary
for
Foreign
Affairs.
They
inherit
Plantagenet
blood
by
direct
descent,
and
Tudor
on
the
distaff
side.
Ha!
Well,
there
is
nothing
very
instructive
in
all
this.
I
think
that
I
must
turn
to
you
Watson,
for
something
more
solid."
"I
have
very
little
difficulty
in
finding
what
I
want,"
said
I,
"for
the
facts
are
quite
recent,
and
the
matter
struck
me
as
remarkable.
I
feared
to
refer
them
to
you,
however,
as
I
knew
that
you
had
an
inquiry
on
hand
and
that
you
disliked
the
intrusion
of
other
matters."
"Oh,
you
mean
the
little
problem
of
the
Grosvenor
Square
furniture
van.
That
is
quite
cleared
up
now--though,
indeed,
it
was
obvious
from
the
first.
Pray
give
me
the
results
of
your
newspaper
selections."
"Here
is
the
first
notice
which
I
can
find.
It
is
in
the
personal
column
of
the
Morning
Post,
and
dates,
as
you
see,
some
weeks
back:
'A
marriage
has
been
arranged,'
it
says,
'and
will,
if
rumour
is
correct,
very
shortly
take
place,
between
Lord
Robert
St.
Simon,
second
son
of
the
Duke
of
Balmoral,
and
Miss
Hatty
Doran,
the
only
daughter
of
Aloysius
Doran.
Esq.,
of
San
Francisco,
Cal.,
U.S.A.'
That
is
all."
"Terse
and
to
the
point,"
remarked
Holmes,
stretching
his
long,
thin
legs
towards
the
fire.
"There
was
a
paragraph
amplifying
this
in
one
of
the
society
papers
of
the
same
week.
Ah,
here
it
is:
'There
will
soon
be
a
call
for
protection
in
the
marriage
market,
for
the
present
free-trade
principle
appears
to
tell
heavily
against
our
home
product.
One
by
one
the
management
of
the
noble
houses
of
Great
Britain
is
passing
into
the
hands
of
our
fair
cousins
from
across
the
Atlantic.
An
important
addition
has
been
made
during
the
last
week
to
the
list
of
the
prizes
which
have
been
borne
away
by
these
charming
invaders.
Lord
St.
Simon,
who
has
shown
himself
for
over
twenty
years
proof
against
the
little
god's
arrows,
has
now
definitely
announced
his
approaching
marriage
with
Miss
Hatty
Doran,
the
fascinating
daughter
of
a
California
millionaire.
Miss
Doran,
whose
graceful
figure
and
striking
face
attracted
much
attention
at
the
Westbury
House
festivities,
is
an
only
child,
and
it
is
currently
reported
that
her
dowry
will
run
to
considerably
over
the
six
figures,
with
expectancies
for
the
future.
As
it
is
an
open
secret
that
the
Duke
of
Balmoral
has
been
compelled
to
sell
his
pictures
within
the
last
few
years,
and
as
Lord
St.
Simon
has
no
property
of
his
own
save
the
small
estate
of
Birchmoor,
it
is
obvious
that
the
Californian
heiress
is
not
the
only
gainer
by
an
alliance
which
will
enable
her
to
make
the
easy
and
common
transition
from
a
Republican
lady
to
a
British
peeress.'"
"Anything
else?"
asked
Holmes,
yawning.
"Oh,
yes;
plenty.
Then
there
is
another
note
in
the
Morning
Post
to
say
that
the
marriage
would
be
an
absolutely
quiet
one,
that
it
would
be
at
St.
George's,
Hanover
Square,
that
only
half
a
dozen
intimate
friends
would
be
invited,
and
that
the
party
would
return
to
the
furnished
house
at
Lancaster
Gate
which
has
been
taken
by
Mr.
Aloysius
Doran.
Two
days
later--that
is,
on
Wednesday
last--there
is
a
curt
announcement
that
the
wedding
had
taken
place,
and
that
the
honeymoon
would
be
passed
at
Lord
Backwater's
place,
near
Petersfield.
Those
are
all
the
notices
which
appeared
before
the
disappearance
of
the
bride."
"Before
the
what?"
asked
Holmes
with
a
start.
"The
vanishing
of
the
lady."
"When
did
she
vanish,
then?"
"At
the
wedding
breakfast."
"Indeed.
This
is
more
interesting
than
it
promised
to
be;
quite
dramatic,
in
fact."
"Yes;
it
struck
me
as
being
a
little
out
of
the
common."
"They
often
vanish
before
the
ceremony,
and
occasionally
during
the
honeymoon;
but
I
cannot
call
to
mind
anything
quite
so
prompt
as
this.
Pray
let
me
have
the
details."
"I
warn
you
that
they
are
very
incomplete."
"Perhaps
we
may
make
them
less
so."
"Such
as
they
are,
they
are
set
forth
in
a
single
article
of
a
morning
paper
of
yesterday,
which
I
will
read
to
you.
It
is
headed,
'Singular
Occurrence
at
a
Fashionable
Wedding':
"'The
family
of
Lord
Robert
St.
Simon
has
been
thrown
into
the
greatest
consternation
by
the
strange
and
painful
episodes
which
have
taken
place
in
connection
with
his
wedding.
The
ceremony,
as
shortly
announced
in
the
papers
of
yesterday,
occurred
on
the
previous
morning;
but
it
is
only
now
that
it
has
been
possible
to
confirm
the
strange
rumours
which
have
been
so
persistently
floating
about.
In
spite
of
the
attempts
of
the
friends
to
hush
the
matter
up,
so
much
public
attention
has
now
been
drawn
to
it
that
no
good
purpose
can
be
served
by
affecting
to
disregard
what
is
a
common
subject
for
conversation.
"'The
ceremony,
which
was
performed
at
St.
George's,
Hanover
Square,
was
a
very
quiet
one,
no
one
being
present
save
the
father
of
the
bride,
Mr.
Aloysius
Doran,
the
Duchess
of
Balmoral,
Lord
Backwater,
Lord
Eustace
and
Lady
Clara
St.
Simon
(the
younger
brother
and
sister
of
the
bridegroom),
and
Lady
Alicia
Whittington.
The
whole
party
proceeded
afterwards
to
the
house
of
Mr.
Aloysius
Doran,
at
Lancaster
Gate,
where
breakfast
had
been
prepared.
It
appears
that
some
little
trouble
was
caused
by
a
woman,
whose
name
has
not
been
ascertained,
who
endeavoured
to
force
her
way
into
the
house
after
the
bridal
party,
alleging
that
she
had
some
claim
upon
Lord
St.
Simon.
It
was
only
after
a
painful
and
prolonged
scene
that
she
was
ejected
by
the
butler
and
the
footman.
The
bride,
who
had
fortunately
entered
the
house
before
this
unpleasant
interruption,
had
sat
down
to
breakfast
with
the
rest,
when
she
complained
of
a
sudden
indisposition
and
retired
to
her
room.
Her
prolonged
absence
having
caused
some
comment,
her
father
followed
her,
but
learned
from
her
maid
that
she
had
only
come
up
to
her
chamber
for
an
instant,
caught
up
an
ulster
and
bonnet,
and
hurried
down
to
the
passage.
One
of
the
footmen
declared
that
he
had
seen
a
lady
leave
the
house
thus
apparelled,
but
had
refused
to
credit
that
it
was
his
mistress,
believing
her
to
be
with
the
company.
On
ascertaining
that
his
daughter
had
disappeared,
Mr.
Aloysius
Doran,
in
conjunction
with
the
bridegroom,
instantly
put
themselves
in
communication
with
the
police,
and
very
energetic
inquiries
are
being
made,
which
will
probably
result
in
a
speedy
clearing
up
of
this
very
singular
business.
Up
to
a
late
hour
last
night,
however,
nothing
had
transpired
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
missing
lady.
There
are
rumours
of
foul
play
in
the
matter,
and
it
is
said
that
the
police
have
caused
the
arrest
of
the
woman
who
had
caused
the
original
disturbance,
in
the
belief
that,
from
jealousy
or
some
other
motive,
she
may
have
been
concerned
in
the
strange
disappearance
of
the
bride.'"
"And
is
that
all?"
"Only
one
little
item
in
another
of
the
morning
papers,
but
it
is
a
suggestive
one."
"And
it
is--"
"That
Miss
Flora
Millar,
the
lady
who
had
caused
the
disturbance,
has
actually
been
arrested.
It
appears
that
she
was
formerly
a
danseuse
at
the
Allegro,
and
that
she
has
known
the
bridegroom
for
some
years.
There
are
no
further
particulars,
and
the
whole
case
is
in
your
hands
now--so
far
as
it
has
been
set
forth
in
the
public
press."
"And
an
exceedingly
interesting
case
it
appears
to
be.
I
would
not
have
missed
it
for
worlds.
But
there
is
a
ring
at
the
bell,
Watson,
and
as
the
clock
makes
it
a
few
minutes
after
four,
I
have
no
doubt
that
this
will
prove
to
be
our
noble
client.
Do
not
dream
of
going,
Watson,
for
I
very
much
prefer
having
a
witness,
if
only
as
a
check
to
my
own
memory."
"Lord
Robert
St.
Simon,"
announced
our
page-boy,
throwing
open
the
door.
A
gentleman
entered,
with
a
pleasant,
cultured
face,
high-nosed
and
pale,
with
something
perhaps
of
petulance
about
the
mouth,
and
with
the
steady,
well-opened
eye
of
a
man
whose
pleasant
lot
it
had
ever
been
to
command
and
to
be
obeyed.
His
manner
was
brisk,
and
yet
his
general
appearance
gave
an
undue
impression
of
age,
for
he
had
a
slight
forward
stoop
and
a
little
bend
of
the
knees
as
he
walked.
His
hair,
too,
as
he
swept
off
his
very
curly-brimmed
hat,
was
grizzled
round
the
edges
and
thin
upon
the
top.
As
to
his
dress,
it
was
careful
to
the
verge
of
foppishness,
with
high
collar,
black
frock-coat,
white
waistcoat,
yellow
gloves,
patent-leather
shoes,
and
light-coloured
gaiters.
He
advanced
slowly
into
the
room,
turning
his
head
from
left
to
right,
and
swinging
in
his
right
hand
the
cord
which
held
his
golden
eyeglasses.
"Good-day,
Lord
St.
Simon,"
said
Holmes,
rising
and
bowing.
"Pray
take
the
basket-chair.
This
is
my
friend
and
colleague,
Dr.
Watson.
Draw
up
a
little
to
the
fire,
and
we
will
talk
this
matter
over."
"A
most
painful
matter
to
me,
as
you
can
most
readily
imagine,
Mr.
Holmes.
I
have
been
cut
to
the
quick.
I
understand
that
you
have
already
managed
several
delicate
cases
of
this
sort,
sir,
though
I
presume
that
they
were
hardly
from
the
same
class
of
society."
"No,
I
am
descending."
"I
beg
pardon."
"My
last
client
of
the
sort
was
a
king."
"Oh,
really!
I
had
no
idea.
And
which
king?"
"The
King
of
Scandinavia."
"What!
Had
he
lost
his
wife?"
"You
can
understand,"
said
Holmes
suavely,
"that
I
extend
to
the
affairs
of
my
other
clients
the
same
secrecy
which
I
promise
to
you
in
yours."
"Of
course!
Very
right!
very
right!
I'm
sure
I
beg
pardon.
As
to
my
own
case,
I
am
ready
to
give
you
any
information
which
may
assist
you
in
forming
an
opinion."
"Thank
you.
I
have
already
learned
all
that
is
in
the
public
prints,
nothing
more.
I
presume
that
I
may
take
it
as
correct--this
article,
for
example,
as
to
the
disappearance
of
the
bride."
Lord
St.
Simon
glanced
over
it.
"Yes,
it
is
correct,
as
far
as
it
goes."
"But
it
needs
a
great
deal
of
supplementing
before
anyone
could
offer
an
opinion.
I
think
that
I
may
arrive
at
my
facts
most
directly
by
questioning
you."
"Pray
do
so."
"When
did
you
first
meet
Miss
Hatty
Doran?"
"In
San
Francisco,
a
year
ago."
"You
were
travelling
in
the
States?"
"Yes."
"Did
you
become
engaged
then?"
"No."
"But
you
were
on
a
friendly
footing?"
"I
was
amused
by
her
society,
and
she
could
see
that
I
was
amused."
"Her
father
is
very
rich?"
"He
is
said
to
be
the
richest
man
on
the
Pacific
slope."
"And
how
did
he
make
his
money?"
"In
mining.
He
had
nothing
a
few
years
ago.
Then
he
struck
gold,
invested
it,
and
came
up
by
leaps
and
bounds."
"Now,
what
is
your
own
impression
as
to
the
young
lady's--your
wife's
character?"
The
nobleman
swung
his
glasses
a
little
faster
and
stared
down
into
the
fire.
"You
see,
Mr.
Holmes,"
said
he,
"my
wife
was
twenty
before
her
father
became
a
rich
man.
During
that
time
she
ran
free
in
a
mining
camp
and
wandered
through
woods
or
mountains,
so
that
her
education
has
come
from
Nature
rather
than
from
the
schoolmaster.
She
is
what
we
call
in
England
a
tomboy,
with
a
strong
nature,
wild
and
free,
unfettered
by
any
sort
of
traditions.
She
is
impetuous--volcanic,
I
was
about
to
say.
She
is
swift
in
making
up
her
mind
and
fearless
in
carrying
out
her
resolutions.
On
the
other
hand,
I
would
not
have
given
her
the
name
which
I
have
the
honour
to
bear"--he
gave
a
little
stately
cough--"had
not
I
thought
her
to
be
at
bottom
a
noble
woman.
I
believe
that
she
is
capable
of
heroic
self-sacrifice
and
that
anything
dishonourable
would
be
repugnant
to
her."
"Have
you
her
photograph?"
"I
brought
this
with
me."
He
opened
a
locket
and
showed
us
the
full
face
of
a
very
lovely
woman.
It
was
not
a
photograph
but
an
ivory
miniature,
and
the
artist
had
brought
out
the
full
effect
of
the
lustrous
black
hair,
the
large
dark
eyes,
and
the
exquisite
mouth.
Holmes
gazed
long
and
earnestly
at
it.
Then
he
closed
the
locket
and
handed
it
back
to
Lord
St.
Simon.
"The
young
lady
came
to
London,
then,
and
you
renewed
your
acquaintance?"
"Yes,
her
father
brought
her
over
for
this
last
London
season.
I
met
her
several
times,
became
engaged
to
her,
and
have
now
married
her."
"She
brought,
I
understand,
a
considerable
dowry?"
"A
fair
dowry.
Not
more
than
is
usual
in
my
family."
"And
this,
of
course,
remains
to
you,
since
the
marriage
is
a
fait
accompli?"
"I
really
have
made
no
inquiries
on
the
subject."
"Very
naturally
not.
Did
you
see
Miss
Doran
on
the
day
before
the
wedding?"
"Yes."
"Was
she
in
good
spirits?"
"Never
better.
She
kept
talking
of
what
we
should
do
in
our
future
lives."
"Indeed!
That
is
very
interesting.
And
on
the
morning
of
the
wedding?"
"She
was
as
bright
as
possible--at
least
until
after
the
ceremony."
"And
did
you
observe
any
change
in
her
then?"
"Well,
to
tell
the
truth,
I
saw
then
the
first
signs
that
I
had
ever
seen
that
her
temper
was
just
a
little
sharp.
The
incident
however,
was
too
trivial
to
relate
and
can
have
no
possible
bearing
upon
the
case."
"Pray
let
us
have
it,
for
all
that."
"Oh,
it
is
childish.
She
dropped
her
bouquet
as
we
went
towards
the
vestry.
She
was
passing
the
front
pew
at
the
time,
and
it
fell
over
into
the
pew.
There
was
a
moment's
delay,
but
the
gentleman
in
the
pew
handed
it
up
to
her
again,
and
it
did
not
appear
to
be
the
worse
for
the
fall.
Yet
when
I
spoke
to
her
of
the
matter,
she
answered
me
abruptly;
and
in
the
carriage,
on
our
way
home,
she
seemed
absurdly
agitated
over
this
trifling
cause."
"Indeed!
You
say
that
there
was
a
gentleman
in
the
pew.
Some
of
the
general
public
were
present,
then?"
"Oh,
yes.
It
is
impossible
to
exclude
them
when
the
church
is
open."
"This
gentleman
was
not
one
of
your
wife's
friends?"
"No,
no;
I
call
him
a
gentleman
by
courtesy,
but
he
was
quite
a
common-looking
person.
I
hardly
noticed
his
appearance.
But
really
I
think
that
we
are
wandering
rather
far
from
the
point."
"Lady
St.
Simon,
then,
returned
from
the
wedding
in
a
less
cheerful
frame
of
mind
than
she
had
gone
to
it.
What
did
she
do
on
re-entering
her
father's
house?"
"I
saw
her
in
conversation
with
her
maid."
"And
who
is
her
maid?"
"Alice
is
her
name.
She
is
an
American
and
came
from
California
with
her."
"A
confidential
servant?"
"A
little
too
much
so.
It
seemed
to
me
that
her
mistress
allowed
her
to
take
great
liberties.
Still,
of
course,
in
America
they
look
upon
these
things
in
a
different
way."
"How
long
did
she
speak
to
this
Alice?"
"Oh,
a
few
minutes.
I
had
something
else
to
think
of."
"You
did
not
overhear
what
they
said?"
"Lady
St.
Simon
said
something
about
'jumping
a
claim.'
She
was
accustomed
to
use
slang
of
the
kind.
I
have
no
idea
what
she
meant."
"American
slang
is
very
expressive
sometimes.
And
what
did
your
wife
do
when
she
finished
speaking
to
her
maid?"
"She
walked
into
the
breakfast-room."
"On
your
arm?"
"No,
alone.
She
was
very
independent
in
little
matters
like
that.
Then,
after
we
had
sat
down
for
ten
minutes
or
so,
she
rose
hurriedly,
muttered
some
words
of
apology,
and
left
the
room.
She
never
came
back."
"But
this
maid,
Alice,
as
I
understand,
deposes
that
she
went
to
her
room,
covered
her
bride's
dress
with
a
long
ulster,
put
on
a
bonnet,
and
went
out."
"Quite
so.
And
she
was
afterwards
seen
walking
into
Hyde
Park
in
company
with
Flora
Millar,
a
woman
who
is
now
in
custody,
and
who
had
already
made
a
disturbance
at
Mr.
Doran's
house
that
morning."
"Ah,
yes.
I
should
like
a
few
particulars
as
to
this
young
lady,
and
your
relations
to
her."
Lord
St.
Simon
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
raised
his
eyebrows.
"We
have
been
on
a
friendly
footing
for
some
years--I
may
say
on
a
very
friendly
footing.
She
used
to
be
at
the
Allegro.
I
have
not
treated
her
ungenerously,
and
she
had
no
just
cause
of
complaint
against
me,
but
you
know
what
women
are,
Mr.
Holmes.
Flora
was
a
dear
little
thing,
but
exceedingly
hot-headed
and
devotedly
attached
to
me.
She
wrote
me
dreadful
letters
when
she
heard
that
I
was
about
to
be
married,
and,
to
tell
the
truth,
the
reason
why
I
had
the
marriage
celebrated
so
quietly
was
that
I
feared
lest
there
might
be
a
scandal
in
the
church.
She
came
to
Mr.
Doran's
door
just
after
we
returned,
and
she
endeavoured
to
push
her
way
in,
uttering
very
abusive
expressions
towards
my
wife,
and
even
threatening
her,
but
I
had
foreseen
the
possibility
of
something
of
the
sort,
and
I
had
two
police
fellows
there
in
private
clothes,
who
soon
pushed
her
out
again.
She
was
quiet
when
she
saw
that
there
was
no
good
in
making
a
row."
"Did
your
wife
hear
all
this?"
"No,
thank
goodness,
she
did
not."
"And
she
was
seen
walking
with
this
very
woman
afterwards?"
"Yes.
That
is
what
Mr.
Lestrade,
of
Scotland
Yard,
looks
upon
as
so
serious.
It
is
thought
that
Flora
decoyed
my
wife
out
and
laid
some
terrible
trap
for
her."
"Well,
it
is
a
possible
supposition."
"You
think
so,
too?"
"I
did
not
say
a
probable
one.
But
you
do
not
yourself
look
upon
this
as
likely?"
"I
do
not
think
Flora
would
hurt
a
fly."
"Still,
jealousy
is
a
strange
transformer
of
characters.
Pray
what
is
your
own
theory
as
to
what
took
place?"
"Well,
really,
I
came
to
seek
a
theory,
not
to
propound
one.
I
have
given
you
all
the
facts.
Since
you
ask
me,
however,
I
may
say
that
it
has
occurred
to
me
as
possible
that
the
excitement
of
this
affair,
the
consciousness
that
she
had
made
so
immense
a
social
stride,
had
the
effect
of
causing
some
little
nervous
disturbance
in
my
wife."
"In
short,
that
she
had
become
suddenly
deranged?"
"Well,
really,
when
I
consider
that
she
has
turned
her
back--I
will
not
say
upon
me,
but
upon
so
much
that
many
have
aspired
to
without
success--I
can
hardly
explain
it
in
any
other
fashion."
"Well,
certainly
that
is
also
a
conceivable
hypothesis,"
said
Holmes,
smiling.
"And
now,
Lord
St.
Simon,
I
think
that
I
have
nearly
all
my
data.
May
I
ask
whether
you
were
seated
at
the
breakfast-table
so
that
you
could
see
out
of
the
window?"
"We
could
see
the
other
side
of
the
road
and
the
Park."
"Quite
so.
Then
I
do
not
think
that
I
need
to
detain
you
longer.
I
shall
communicate
with
you."
"Should
you
be
fortunate
enough
to
solve
this
problem,"
said
our
client,
rising.
"I
have
solved
it."
"Eh?
What
was
that?"
"I
say
that
I
have
solved
it."
"Where,
then,
is
my
wife?"
"That
is
a
detail
which
I
shall
speedily
supply."
Lord
St.
Simon
shook
his
head.
"I
am
afraid
that
it
will
take
wiser
heads
than
yours
or
mine,"
he
remarked,
and
bowing
in
a
stately,
old-fashioned
manner
he
departed.
"It
is
very
good
of
Lord
St.
Simon
to
honour
my
head
by
putting
it
on
a
level
with
his
own,"
said
Sherlock
Holmes,
laughing.
"I
think
that
I
shall
have
a
whisky
and
soda
and
a
cigar
after
all
this
cross-questioning.
I
had
formed
my
conclusions
as
to
the
case
before
our
client
came
into
the
room."
"My
dear
Holmes!"
"I
have
notes
of
several
similar
cases,
though
none,
as
I
remarked
before,
which
were
quite
as
prompt.
My
whole
examination
served
to
turn
my
conjecture
into
a
certainty.
Circumstantial
evidence
is
occasionally
very
convincing,
as
when
you
find
a
trout
in
the
milk,
to
quote
Thoreau's
example."
"But
I
have
heard
all
that
you
have
heard."
"Without,
however,
the
knowledge
of
pre-existing
cases
which
serves
me
so
well.
There
was
a
parallel
instance
in
Aberdeen
some
years
back,
and
something
on
very
much
the
same
lines
at
Munich
the
year
after
the
Franco-Prussian
War.
It
is
one
of
these
cases--but,
hullo,
here
is
Lestrade!
Good-afternoon,
Lestrade!
You
will
find
an
extra
tumbler
upon
the
sideboard,
and
there
are
cigars
in
the
box."
The
official
detective
was
attired
in
a
pea-jacket
and
cravat,
which
gave
him
a
decidedly
nautical
appearance,
and
he
carried
a
black
canvas
bag
in
his
hand.
With
a
short
greeting
he
seated
himself
and
lit
the
cigar
which
had
been
offered
to
him.
"What's
up,
then?"
asked
Holmes
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye.
"You
look
dissatisfied."
"And
I
feel
dissatisfied.
It
is
this
infernal
St.
Simon
marriage
case.
I
can
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
the
business."
"Really!
You
surprise
me."
"Who
ever
heard
of
such
a
mixed
affair?
Every
clue
seems
to
slip
through
my
fingers.
I
have
been
at
work
upon
it
all
day."
"And
very
wet
it
seems
to
have
made
you,"
said
Holmes
laying
his
hand
upon
the
arm
of
the
pea-jacket.
"Yes,
I
have
been
dragging
the
Serpentine."
"In
heaven's
name,
what
for?"
"In
search
of
the
body
of
Lady
St.
Simon."
Sherlock
Holmes
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
heartily.
"Have
you
dragged
the
basin
of
Trafalgar
Square
fountain?"
he
asked.
"Why?
What
do
you
mean?"
"Because
you
have
just
as
good
a
chance
of
finding
this
lady
in
the
one
as
in
the
other."
Lestrade
shot
an
angry
glance
at
my
companion.
"I
suppose
you
know
all
about
it,"
he
snarled.
"Well,
I
have
only
just
heard
the
facts,
but
my
mind
is
made
up."
"Oh,
indeed!
Then
you
think
that
the
Serpentine
plays
no
part
in
the
matter?"
"I
think
it
very
unlikely."
"Then
perhaps
you
will
kindly
explain
how
it
is
that
we
found
this
in
it?"
He
opened
his
bag
as
he
spoke,
and
tumbled
onto
the
floor
a
wedding-dress
of
watered
silk,
a
pair
of
white
satin
shoes
and
a
bride's
wreath
and
veil,
all
discoloured
and
soaked
in
water.
"There,"
said
he,
putting
a
new
wedding-ring
upon
the
top
of
the
pile.
"There
is
a
little
nut
for
you
to
crack,
Master
Holmes."
"Oh,
indeed!"
said
my
friend,
blowing
blue
rings
into
the
air.
"You
dragged
them
from
the
Serpentine?"
"No.
They
were
found
floating
near
the
margin
by
a
park-keeper.
They
have
been
identified
as
her
clothes,
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
the
clothes
were
there
the
body
would
not
be
far
off."
"By
the
same
brilliant
reasoning,
every
man's
body
is
to
be
found
in
the
neighbourhood
of
his
wardrobe.
And
pray
what
did
you
hope
to
arrive
at
through
this?"
"At
some
evidence
implicating
Flora
Millar
in
the
disappearance."
"I
am
afraid
that
you
will
find
it
difficult."
"Are
you,
indeed,
now?"
cried
Lestrade
with
some
bitterness.
"I
am
afraid,
Holmes,
that
you
are
not
very
practical
with
your
deductions
and
your
inferences.
You
have
made
two
blunders
in
as
many
minutes.
This
dress
does
implicate
Miss
Flora
Millar."
"And
how?"
"In
the
dress
is
a
pocket.
In
the
pocket
is
a
card-case.
In
the
card-case
is
a
note.
And
here
is
the
very
note."
He
slapped
it
down
upon
the
table
in
front
of
him.
"Listen
to
this:
'You
will
see
me
when
all
is
ready.
Come
at
once.
F.H.M.'
Now
my
theory
all
along
has
been
that
Lady
St.
Simon
was
decoyed
away
by
Flora
Millar,
and
that
she,
with
confederates,
no
doubt,
was
responsible
for
her
disappearance.
Here,
signed
with
her
initials,
is
the
very
note
which
was
no
doubt
quietly
slipped
into
her
hand
at
the
door
and
which
lured
her
within
their
reach."
"Very
good,
Lestrade,"
said
Holmes,
laughing.
"You
really
are
very
fine
indeed.
Let
me
see
it."
He
took
up
the
paper
in
a
listless
way,
but
his
attention
instantly
became
riveted,
and
he
gave
a
little
cry
of
satisfaction.
"This
is
indeed
important,"
said
he.
"Ha!
you
find
it
so?"
"Extremely
so.
I
congratulate
you
warmly."
Lestrade
rose
in
his
triumph
and
bent
his
head
to
look.
"Why,"
he
shrieked,
"you're
looking
at
the
wrong
side!"
"On
the
contrary,
this
is
the
right
side."
"The
right
side?
You're
mad!
Here
is
the
note
written
in
pencil
over
here."
"And
over
here
is
what
appears
to
be
the
fragment
of
a
hotel
bill,
which
interests
me
deeply."
"There's
nothing
in
it.
I
looked
at
it
before,"
said
Lestrade.
"'Oct.
4th,
rooms
8s.,
breakfast
2s.
6d.,
cocktail
1s.,
lunch
2s.
6d.,
glass
sherry,
8d.'
I
see
nothing
in
that."
"Very
likely
not.
It
is
most
important,
all
the
same.
As
to
the
note,
it
is
important
also,
or
at
least
the
initials
are,
so
I
congratulate
you
again."
"I've
wasted
time
enough,"
said
Lestrade,
rising.
"I
believe
in
hard
work
and
not
in
sitting
by
the
fire
spinning
fine
theories.
Good-day,
Mr.
Holmes,
and
we
shall
see
which
gets
to
the
bottom
of
the
matter
first."
He
gathered
up
the
garments,
thrust
them
into
the
bag,
and
made
for
the
door.
"Just
one
hint
to
you,
Lestrade,"
drawled
Holmes
before
his
rival
vanished;
"I
will
tell
you
the
true
solution
of
the
matter.
Lady
St.
Simon
is
a
myth.
There
is
not,
and
there
never
has
been,
any
such
person."
Lestrade
looked
sadly
at
my
companion.
Then
he
turned
to
me,
tapped
his
forehead
three
times,
shook
his
head
solemnly,
and
hurried
away.
He
had
hardly
shut
the
door
behind
him
when
Holmes
rose
to
put
on
his
overcoat.
"There
is
something
in
what
the
fellow
says
about
outdoor
work,"
he
remarked,
"so
I
think,
Watson,
that
I
must
leave
you
to
your
papers
for
a
little."
It
was
after
five
o'clock
when
Sherlock
Holmes
left
me,
but
I
had
no
time
to
be
lonely,
for
within
an
hour
there
arrived
a
confectioner's
man
with
a
very
large
flat
box.
This
he
unpacked
with
the
help
of
a
youth
whom
he
had
brought
with
him,
and
presently,
to
my
very
great
astonishment,
a
quite
epicurean
little
cold
supper
began
to
be
laid
out
upon
our
humble
lodging-house
mahogany.
There
were
a
couple
of
brace
of
cold
woodcock,
a
pheasant,
a
pâté
de
foie
gras
pie
with
a
group
of
ancient
and
cobwebby
bottles.
Having
laid
out
all
these
luxuries,
my
two
visitors
vanished
away,
like
the
genii
of
the
Arabian
Nights,
with
no
explanation
save
that
the
things
had
been
paid
for
and
were
ordered
to
this
address.
Just
before
nine
o'clock
Sherlock
Holmes
stepped
briskly
into
the
room.
His
features
were
gravely
set,
but
there
was
a
light
in
his
eye
which
made
me
think
that
he
had
not
been
disappointed
in
his
conclusions.
"They
have
laid
the
supper,
then,"
he
said,
rubbing
his
hands.
"You
seem
to
expect
company.
They
have
laid
for
five."
"Yes,
I
fancy
we
may
have
some
company
dropping
in,"
said
he.
"I
am
surprised
that
Lord
St.
Simon
has
not
already
arrived.
Ha!
I
fancy
that
I
hear
his
step
now
upon
the
stairs."
It
was
indeed
our
visitor
of
the
afternoon
who
came
bustling
in,
dangling
his
glasses
more
vigorously
than
ever,
and
with
a
very
perturbed
expression
upon
his
aristocratic
features.
"My
messenger
reached
you,
then?"
asked
Holmes.
"Yes,
and
I
confess
that
the
contents
startled
me
beyond
measure.
Have
you
good
authority
for
what
you
say?"
"The
best
possible."
Lord
St.
Simon
sank
into
a
chair
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead.
"What
will
the
Duke
say,"
he
murmured,
"when
he
hears
that
one
of
the
family
has
been
subjected
to
such
humiliation?"
"It
is
the
purest
accident.
I
cannot
allow
that
there
is
any
humiliation."
"Ah,
you
look
on
these
things
from
another
standpoint."
"I
fail
to
see
that
anyone
is
to
blame.
I
can
hardly
see
how
the
lady
could
have
acted
otherwise,
though
her
abrupt
method
of
doing
it
was
undoubtedly
to
be
regretted.
Having
no
mother,
she
had
no
one
to
advise
her
at
such
a
crisis."
"It
was
a
slight,
sir,
a
public
slight,"
said
Lord
St.
Simon,
tapping
his
fingers
upon
the
table.
"You
must
make
allowance
for
this
poor
girl,
placed
in
so
unprecedented
a
position."
"I
will
make
no
allowance.
I
am
very
angry
indeed,
and
I
have
been
shamefully
used."
"I
think
that
I
heard
a
ring,"
said
Holmes.
"Yes,
there
are
steps
on
the
landing.
If
I
cannot
persuade
you
to
take
a
lenient
view
of
the
matter,
Lord
St.
Simon,
I
have
brought
an
advocate
here
who
may
be
more
successful."
He
opened
the
door
and
ushered
in
a
lady
and
gentleman.
"Lord
St.
Simon,"
said
he
"allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Francis
Hay
Moulton.
The
lady,
I
think,
you
have
already
met."
At
the
sight
of
these
newcomers
our
client
had
sprung
from
his
seat
and
stood
very
erect,
with
his
eyes
cast
down
and
his
hand
thrust
into
the
breast
of
his
frock-coat,
a
picture
of
offended
dignity.
The
lady
had
taken
a
quick
step
forward
and
had
held
out
her
hand
to
him,
but
he
still
refused
to
raise
his
eyes.
It
was
as
well
for
his
resolution,
perhaps,
for
her
pleading
face
was
one
which
it
was
hard
to
resist.
"You're
angry,
Robert,"
said
she.
"Well,
I
guess
you
have
every
cause
to
be."
"Pray
make
no
apology
to
me,"
said
Lord
St.
Simon
bitterly.
"Oh,
yes,
I
know
that
I
have
treated
you
real
bad
and
that
I
should
have
spoken
to
you
before
I
went;
but
I
was
kind
of
rattled,
and
from
the
time
when
I
saw
Frank
here
again
I
just
didn't
know
what
I
was
doing
or
saying.
I
only
wonder
I
didn't
fall
down
and
do
a
faint
right
there
before
the
altar."
"Perhaps,
Mrs.
Moulton,
you
would
like
my
friend
and
me
to
leave
the
room
while
you
explain
this
matter?"
"If
I
may
give
an
opinion,"
remarked
the
strange
gentleman,
"we've
had
just
a
little
too
much
secrecy
over
this
business
already.
For
my
part,
I
should
like
all
Europe
and
America
to
hear
the
rights
of
it."
He
was
a
small,
wiry,
sunburnt
man,
clean-shaven,
with
a
sharp
face
and
alert
manner.
"Then
I'll
tell
our
story
right
away,"
said
the
lady.
"Frank
here
and
I
met
in
'84,
in
McQuire's
camp,
near
the
Rockies,
where
pa
was
working
a
claim.
We
were
engaged
to
each
other,
Frank
and
I;
but
then
one
day
father
struck
a
rich
pocket
and
made
a
pile,
while
poor
Frank
here
had
a
claim
that
petered
out
and
came
to
nothing.
The
richer
pa
grew
the
poorer
was
Frank;
so
at
last
pa
wouldn't
hear
of
our
engagement
lasting
any
longer,
and
he
took
me
away
to
'Frisco.
Frank
wouldn't
throw
up
his
hand,
though;
so
he
followed
me
there,
and
he
saw
me
without
pa
knowing
anything
about
it.
It
would
only
have
made
him
mad
to
know,
so
we
just
fixed
it
all
up
for
ourselves.
Frank
said
that
he
would
go
and
make
his
pile,
too,
and
never
come
back
to
claim
me
until
he
had
as
much
as
pa.
So
then
I
promised
to
wait
for
him
to
the
end
of
time
and
pledged
myself
not
to
marry
anyone
else
while
he
lived.
'Why
shouldn't
we
be
married
right
away,
then,'
said
he,
'and
then
I
will
feel
sure
of
you;
and
I
won't
claim
to
be
your
husband
until
I
come
back?'
Well,
we
talked
it
over,
and
he
had
fixed
it
all
up
so
nicely,
with
a
clergyman
all
ready
in
waiting,
that
we
just
did
it
right
there;
and
then
Frank
went
off
to
seek
his
fortune,
and
I
went
back
to
pa.
"The
next
I
heard
of
Frank
was
that
he
was
in
Montana,
and
then
he
went
prospecting
in
Arizona,
and
then
I
heard
of
him
from
New
Mexico.
After
that
came
a
long
newspaper
story
about
how
a
miners'
camp
had
been
attacked
by
Apache
Indians,
and
there
was
my
Frank's
name
among
the
killed.
I
fainted
dead
away,
and
I
was
very
sick
for
months
after.
Pa
thought
I
had
a
decline
and
took
me
to
half
the
doctors
in
'Frisco.
Not
a
word
of
news
came
for
a
year
and
more,
so
that
I
never
doubted
that
Frank
was
really
dead.
Then
Lord
St.
Simon
came
to
'Frisco,
and
we
came
to
London,
and
a
marriage
was
arranged,
and
pa
was
very
pleased,
but
I
felt
all
the
time
that
no
man
on
this
earth
would
ever
take
the
place
in
my
heart
that
had
been
given
to
my
poor
Frank.
"Still,
if
I
had
married
Lord
St.
Simon,
of
course
I'd
have
done
my
duty
by
him.
We
can't
command
our
love,
but
we
can
our
actions.
I
went
to
the
altar
with
him
with
the
intention
to
make
him
just
as
good
a
wife
as
it
was
in
me
to
be.
But
you
may
imagine
what
I
felt
when,
just
as
I
came
to
the
altar
rails,
I
glanced
back
and
saw
Frank
standing
and
looking
at
me
out
of
the
first
pew.
I
thought
it
was
his
ghost
at
first;
but
when
I
looked
again
there
he
was
still,
with
a
kind
of
question
in
his
eyes,
as
if
to
ask
me
whether
I
were
glad
or
sorry
to
see
him.
I
wonder
I
didn't
drop.
I
know
that
everything
was
turning
round,
and
the
words
of
the
clergyman
were
just
like
the
buzz
of
a
bee
in
my
ear.
I
didn't
know
what
to
do.
Should
I
stop
the
service
and
make
a
scene
in
the
church?
I
glanced
at
him
again,
and
he
seemed
to
know
what
I
was
thinking,
for
he
raised
his
finger
to
his
lips
to
tell
me
to
be
still.
Then
I
saw
him
scribble
on
a
piece
of
paper,
and
I
knew
that
he
was
writing
me
a
note.
As
I
passed
his
pew
on
the
way
out
I
dropped
my
bouquet
over
to
him,
and
he
slipped
the
note
into
my
hand
when
he
returned
me
the
flowers.
It
was
only
a
line
asking
me
to
join
him
when
he
made
the
sign
to
me
to
do
so.
Of
course
I
never
doubted
for
a
moment
that
my
first
duty
was
now
to
him,
and
I
determined
to
do
just
whatever
he
might
direct.
"When
I
got
back
I
told
my
maid,
who
had
known
him
in
California,
and
had
always
been
his
friend.
I
ordered
her
to
say
nothing,
but
to
get
a
few
things
packed
and
my
ulster
ready.
I
know
I
ought
to
have
spoken
to
Lord
St.
Simon,
but
it
was
dreadful
hard
before
his
mother
and
all
those
great
people.
I
just
made
up
my
mind
to
run
away
and
explain
afterwards.
I
hadn't
been
at
the
table
ten
minutes
before
I
saw
Frank
out
of
the
window
at
the
other
side
of
the
road.
He
beckoned
to
me
and
then
began
walking
into
the
Park.
I
slipped
out,
put
on
my
things,
and
followed
him.
Some
woman
came
talking
something
or
other
about
Lord
St.
Simon
to
me--seemed
to
me
from
the
little
I
heard
as
if
he
had
a
little
secret
of
his
own
before
marriage
also--but
I
managed
to
get
away
from
her
and
soon
overtook
Frank.
We
got
into
a
cab
together,
and
away
we
drove
to
some
lodgings
he
had
taken
in
Gordon
Square,
and
that
was
my
true
wedding
after
all
those
years
of
waiting.
Frank
had
been
a
prisoner
among
the
Apaches,
had
escaped,
came
on
to
'Frisco,
found
that
I
had
given
him
up
for
dead
and
had
gone
to
England,
followed
me
there,
and
had
come
upon
me
at
last
on
the
very
morning
of
my
second
wedding."
"I
saw
it
in
a
paper,"
explained
the
American.
"It
gave
the
name
and
the
church
but
not
where
the
lady
lived."
"Then
we
had
a
talk
as
to
what
we
should
do,
and
Frank
was
all
for
openness,
but
I
was
so
ashamed
of
it
all
that
I
felt
as
if
I
should
like
to
vanish
away
and
never
see
any
of
them
again--just
sending
a
line
to
pa,
perhaps,
to
show
him
that
I
was
alive.
It
was
awful
to
me
to
think
of
all
those
lords
and
ladies
sitting
round
that
breakfast-table
and
waiting
for
me
to
come
back.
So
Frank
took
my
wedding-clothes
and
things
and
made
a
bundle
of
them,
so
that
I
should
not
be
traced,
and
dropped
them
away
somewhere
where
no
one
could
find
them.
It
is
likely
that
we
should
have
gone
on
to
Paris
to-morrow,
only
that
this
good
gentleman,
Mr.
Holmes,
came
round
to
us
this
evening,
though
how
he
found
us
is
more
than
I
can
think,
and
he
showed
us
very
clearly
and
kindly
that
I
was
wrong
and
that
Frank
was
right,
and
that
we
should
be
putting
ourselves
in
the
wrong
if
we
were
so
secret.
Then
he
offered
to
give
us
a
chance
of
talking
to
Lord
St.
Simon
alone,
and
so
we
came
right
away
round
to
his
rooms
at
once.
Now,
Robert,
you
have
heard
it
all,
and
I
am
very
sorry
if
I
have
given
you
pain,
and
I
hope
that
you
do
not
think
very
meanly
of
me."
Lord
St.
Simon
had
by
no
means
relaxed
his
rigid
attitude,
but
had
listened
with
a
frowning
brow
and
a
compressed
lip
to
this
long
narrative.
"Excuse
me,"
he
said,
"but
it
is
not
my
custom
to
discuss
my
most
intimate
personal
affairs
in
this
public
manner."
"Then
you
won't
forgive
me?
You
won't
shake
hands
before
I
go?"
"Oh,
certainly,
if
it
would
give
you
any
pleasure."
He
put
out
his
hand
and
coldly
grasped
that
which
she
extended
to
him.
"I
had
hoped,"
suggested
Holmes,
"that
you
would
have
joined
us
in
a
friendly
supper."
"I
think
that
there
you
ask
a
little
too
much,"
responded
his
Lordship.
"I
may
be
forced
to
acquiesce
in
these
recent
developments,
but
I
can
hardly
be
expected
to
make
merry
over
them.
I
think
that
with
your
permission
I
will
now
wish
you
all
a
very
good-night."
He
included
us
all
in
a
sweeping
bow
and
stalked
out
of
the
room.
"Then
I
trust
that
you
at
least
will
honour
me
with
your
company,"
said
Sherlock
Holmes.
"It
is
always
a
joy
to
meet
an
American,
Mr.
Moulton,
for
I
am
one
of
those
who
believe
that
the
folly
of
a
monarch
and
the
blundering
of
a
minister
in
far-gone
years
will
not
prevent
our
children
from
being
some
day
citizens
of
the
same
world-wide
country
under
a
flag
which
shall
be
a
quartering
of
the
Union
Jack
with
the
Stars
and
Stripes."
"The
case
has
been
an
interesting
one,"
remarked
Holmes
when
our
visitors
had
left
us,
"because
it
serves
to
show
very
clearly
how
simple
the
explanation
may
be
of
an
affair
which
at
first
sight
seems
to
be
almost
inexplicable.
Nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
the
sequence
of
events
as
narrated
by
this
lady,
and
nothing
stranger
than
the
result
when
viewed,
for
instance,
by
Mr.
Lestrade
of
Scotland
Yard."
"You
were
not
yourself
at
fault
at
all,
then?"
"From
the
first,
two
facts
were
very
obvious
to
me,
the
one
that
the
lady
had
been
quite
willing
to
undergo
the
wedding
ceremony,
the
other
that
she
had
repented
of
it
within
a
few
minutes
of
returning
home.
Obviously
something
had
occurred
during
the
morning,
then,
to
cause
her
to
change
her
mind.
What
could
that
something
be?
She
could
not
have
spoken
to
anyone
when
she
was
out,
for
she
had
been
in
the
company
of
the
bridegroom.
Had
she
seen
someone,
then?
If
she
had,
it
must
be
someone
from
America
because
she
had
spent
so
short
a
time
in
this
country
that
she
could
hardly
have
allowed
anyone
to
acquire
so
deep
an
influence
over
her
that
the
mere
sight
of
him
would
induce
her
to
change
her
plans
so
completely.
You
see
we
have
already
arrived,
by
a
process
of
exclusion,
at
the
idea
that
she
might
have
seen
an
American.
Then
who
could
this
American
be,
and
why
should
he
possess
so
much
influence
over
her?
It
might
be
a
lover;
it
might
be
a
husband.
Her
young
womanhood
had,
I
knew,
been
spent
in
rough
scenes
and
under
strange
conditions.
So
far
I
had
got
before
I
ever
heard
Lord
St.
Simon's
narrative.
When
he
told
us
of
a
man
in
a
pew,
of
the
change
in
the
bride's
manner,
of
so
transparent
a
device
for
obtaining
a
note
as
the
dropping
of
a
bouquet,
of
her
resort
to
her
confidential
maid,
and
of
her
very
significant
allusion
to
claim-jumping--which
in
miners'
parlance
means
taking
possession
of
that
which
another
person
has
a
prior
claim
to--the
whole
situation
became
absolutely
clear.
She
had
gone
off
with
a
man,
and
the
man
was
either
a
lover
or
was
a
previous
husband--the
chances
being
in
favour
of
the
latter."
"And
how
in
the
world
did
you
find
them?"
"It
might
have
been
difficult,
but
friend
Lestrade
held
information
in
his
hands
the
value
of
which
he
did
not
himself
know.
The
initials
were,
of
course,
of
the
highest
importance,
but
more
valuable
still
was
it
to
know
that
within
a
week
he
had
settled
his
bill
at
one
of
the
most
select
London
hotels."
"How
did
you
deduce
the
select?"
"By
the
select
prices.
Eight
shillings
for
a
bed
and
eightpence
for
a
glass
of
sherry
pointed
to
one
of
the
most
expensive
hotels.
There
are
not
many
in
London
which
charge
at
that
rate.
In
the
second
one
which
I
visited
in
Northumberland
Avenue,
I
learned
by
an
inspection
of
the
book
that
Francis
H.
Moulton,
an
American
gentleman,
had
left
only
the
day
before,
and
on
looking
over
the
entries
against
him,
I
came
upon
the
very
items
which
I
had
seen
in
the
duplicate
bill.
His
letters
were
to
be
forwarded
to
226
Gordon
Square;
so
thither
I
travelled,
and
being
fortunate
enough
to
find
the
loving
couple
at
home,
I
ventured
to
give
them
some
paternal
advice
and
to
point
out
to
them
that
it
would
be
better
in
every
way
that
they
should
make
their
position
a
little
clearer
both
to
the
general
public
and
to
Lord
St.
Simon
in
particular.
I
invited
them
to
meet
him
here,
and,
as
you
see,
I
made
him
keep
the
appointment."
"But
with
no
very
good
result,"
I
remarked.
"His
conduct
was
certainly
not
very
gracious."
"Ah,
Watson,"
said
Holmes,
smiling,
"perhaps
you
would
not
be
very
gracious
either,
if,
after
all
the
trouble
of
wooing
and
wedding,
you
found
yourself
deprived
in
an
instant
of
wife
and
of
fortune.
I
think
that
we
may
judge
Lord
St.
Simon
very
mercifully
and
thank
our
stars
that
we
are
never
likely
to
find
ourselves
in
the
same
position.
Draw
your
chair
up
and
hand
me
my
violin,
for
the
only
problem
we
have
still
to
solve
is
how
to
while
away
these
bleak
autumnal
evenings."
XI.
THE
ADVENTURE
OF
THE
BERYL
CORONET
"Holmes,"
said
I
as
I
stood
one
morning
in
our
bow-window
looking
down
the
street,
"here
is
a
madman
coming
along.
It
seems
rather
sad
that
his
relatives
should
allow
him
to
come
out
alone."
My
friend
rose
lazily
from
his
armchair
and
stood
with
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
dressing-gown,
looking
over
my
shoulder.
It
was
a
bright,
crisp
February
morning,
and
the
snow
of
the
day
before
still
lay
deep
upon
the
ground,
shimmering
brightly
in
the
wintry
sun.
Down
the
centre
of
Baker
Street
it
had
been
ploughed
into
a
brown
crumbly
band
by
the
traffic,
but
at
either
side
and
on
the
heaped-up
edges
of
the
foot-paths
it
still
lay
as
white
as
when
it
fell.
The
grey
pavement
had
been
cleaned
and
scraped,
but
was
still
dangerously
slippery,
so
that
there
were
fewer
passengers
than
usual.
Indeed,
from
the
direction
of
the
Metropolitan
Station
no
one
was
coming
save
the
single
gentleman
whose
eccentric
conduct
had
drawn
my
attention.
He
was
a
man
of
about
fifty,
tall,
portly,
and
imposing,
with
a
massive,
strongly
marked
face
and
a
commanding
figure.
He
was
dressed
in
a
sombre
yet
rich
style,
in
black
frock-coat,
shining
hat,
neat
brown
gaiters,
and
well-cut
pearl-grey
trousers.
Yet
his
actions
were
in
absurd
contrast
to
the
dignity
of
his
dress
and
features,
for
he
was
running
hard,
with
occasional
little
springs,
such
as
a
weary
man
gives
who
is
little
accustomed
to
set
any
tax
upon
his
legs.
As
he
ran
he
jerked
his
hands
up
and
down,
waggled
his
head,
and
writhed
his
face
into
the
most
extraordinary
contortions.
"What
on
earth
can
be
the
matter
with
him?"
I
asked.
"He
is
looking
up
at
the
numbers
of
the
houses."
"I
believe
that
he
is
coming
here,"
said
Holmes,
rubbing
his
hands.
"Here?"
"Yes;
I
rather
think
he
is
coming
to
consult
me
professionally.
I
think
that
I
recognise
the
symptoms.
Ha!
did
I
not
tell
you?"
As
he
spoke,
the
man,
puffing
and
blowing,
rushed
at
our
door
and
pulled
at
our
bell
until
the
whole
house
resounded
with
the
clanging.
A
few
moments
later
he
was
in
our
room,
still
puffing,
still
gesticulating,
but
with
so
fixed
a
look
of
grief
and
despair
in
his
eyes
that
our
smiles
were
turned
in
an
instant
to
horror
and
pity.
For
a
while
he
could
not
get
his
words
out,
but
swayed
his
body
and
plucked
at
his
hair
like
one
who
has
been
driven
to
the
extreme
limits
of
his
reason.
Then,
suddenly
springing
to
his
feet,
he
beat
his
head
against
the
wall
with
such
force
that
we
both
rushed
upon
him
and
tore
him
away
to
the
centre
of
the
room.
Sherlock
Holmes
pushed
him
down
into
the
easy-chair
and,
sitting
beside
him,
patted
his
hand
and
chatted
with
him
in
the
easy,
soothing
tones
which
he
knew
so
well
how
to
employ.
"You
have
come
to
me
to
tell
your
story,
have
you
not?"
said
he.
"You
are
fatigued
with
your
haste.
Pray
wait
until
you
have
recovered
yourself,
and
then
I
shall
be
most
happy
to
look
into
any
little
problem
which
you
may
submit
to
me."
The
man
sat
for
a
minute
or
more
with
a
heaving
chest,
fighting
against
his
emotion.
Then
he
passed
his
handkerchief
over
his
brow,
set
his
lips
tight,
and
turned
his
face
towards
us.
"No
doubt
you
think
me
mad?"
said
he.
"I
see
that
you
have
had
some
great
trouble,"
responded
Holmes.
"God
knows
I
have!--a
trouble
which
is
enough
to
unseat
my
reason,
so
sudden
and
so
terrible
is
it.
Public
disgrace
I
might
have
faced,
although
I
am
a
man
whose
character
has
never
yet
borne
a
stain.
Private
affliction
also
is
the
lot
of
every
man;
but
the
two
coming
together,
and
in
so
frightful
a
form,
have
been
enough
to
shake
my
very
soul.
Besides,
it
is
not
I
alone.
The
very
noblest
in
the
land
may
suffer
unless
some
way
be
found
out
of
this
horrible
affair."
"Pray
compose
yourself,
sir,"
said
Holmes,
"and
let
me
have
a
clear
account
of
who
you
are
and
what
it
is
that
has
befallen
you."
"My
name,"
answered
our
visitor,
"is
probably
familiar
to
your
ears.
I
am
Alexander
Holder,
of
the
banking
firm
of
Holder
&
Stevenson,
of
Threadneedle
Street."
The
name
was
indeed
well
known
to
us
as
belonging
to
the
senior
partner
in
the
second
largest
private
banking
concern
in
the
City
of
London.
What
could
have
happened,
then,
to
bring
one
of
the
foremost
citizens
of
London
to
this
most
pitiable
pass?
We
waited,
all
curiosity,
until
with
another
effort
he
braced
himself
to
tell
his
story.
"I
feel
that
time
is
of
value,"
said
he;
"that
is
why
I
hastened
here
when
the
police
inspector
suggested
that
I
should
secure
your
co-operation.
I
came
to
Baker
Street
by
the
Underground
and
hurried
from
there
on
foot,
for
the
cabs
go
slowly
through
this
snow.
That
is
why
I
was
so
out
of
breath,
for
I
am
a
man
who
takes
very
little
exercise.
I
feel
better
now,
and
I
will
put
the
facts
before
you
as
shortly
and
yet
as
clearly
as
I
can.
"It
is,
of
course,
well
known
to
you
that
in
a
successful
banking
business
as
much
depends
upon
our
being
able
to
find
remunerative
investments
for
our
funds
as
upon
our
increasing
our
connection
and
the
number
of
our
depositors.
One
of
our
most
lucrative
means
of
laying
out
money
is
in
the
shape
of
loans,
where
the
security
is
unimpeachable.
We
have
done
a
good
deal
in
this
direction
during
the
last
few
years,
and
there
are
many
noble
families
to
whom
we
have
advanced
large
sums
upon
the
security
of
their
pictures,
libraries,
or
plate.
"Yesterday
morning
I
was
seated
in
my
office
at
the
bank
when
a
card
was
brought
in
to
me
by
one
of
the
clerks.
I
started
when
I
saw
the
name,
for
it
was
that
of
none
other
than--well,
perhaps
even
to
you
I
had
better
say
no
more
than
that
it
was
a
name
which
is
a
household
word
all
over
the
earth--one
of
the
highest,
noblest,
most
exalted
names
in
England.
I
was
overwhelmed
by
the
honour
and
attempted,
when
he
entered,
to
say
so,
but
he
plunged
at
once
into
business
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
wishes
to
hurry
quickly
through
a
disagreeable
task.
"'Mr.
Holder,'
said
he,
'I
have
been
informed
that
you
are
in
the
habit
of
advancing
money.'
"'The
firm
does
so
when
the
security
is
good.'
I
answered.
"'It
is
absolutely
essential
to
me,'
said
he,
'that
I
should
have
50,000
pounds
at
once.
I
could,
of
course,
borrow
so
trifling
a
sum
ten
times
over
from
my
friends,
but
I
much
prefer
to
make
it
a
matter
of
business
and
to
carry
out
that
business
myself.
In
my
position
you
can
readily
understand
that
it
is
unwise
to
place
one's
self
under
obligations.'
"'For
how
long,
may
I
ask,
do
you
want
this
sum?'
I
asked.
"'Next
Monday
I
have
a
large
sum
due
to
me,
and
I
shall
then
most
certainly
repay
what
you
advance,
with
whatever
interest
you
think
it
right
to
charge.
But
it
is
very
essential
to
me
that
the
money
should
be
paid
at
once.'
"'I
should
be
happy
to
advance
it
without
further
parley
from
my
own
private
purse,'
said
I,
'were
it
not
that
the
strain
would
be
rather
more
than
it
could
bear.
If,
on
the
other
hand,
I
am
to
do
it
in
the
name
of
the
firm,
then
in
justice
to
my
partner
I
must
insist
that,
even
in
your
case,
every
businesslike
precaution
should
be
taken.'
"'I
should
much
prefer
to
have
it
so,'
said
he,
raising
up
a
square,
black
morocco
case
which
he
had
laid
beside
his
chair.
'You
have
doubtless
heard
of
the
Beryl
Coronet?'
"'One
of
the
most
precious
public
possessions
of
the
empire,'
said
I.
"'Precisely.'
He
opened
the
case,
and
there,
imbedded
in
soft,
flesh-coloured
velvet,
lay
the
magnificent
piece
of
jewellery
which
he
had
named.
'There
are
thirty-nine
enormous
beryls,'
said
he,
'and
the
price
of
the
gold
chasing
is
incalculable.
The
lowest
estimate
would
put
the
worth
of
the
coronet
at
double
the
sum
which
I
have
asked.
I
am
prepared
to
leave
it
with
you
as
my
security.'
"I
took
the
precious
case
into
my
hands
and
looked
in
some
perplexity
from
it
to
my
illustrious
client.
"'You
doubt
its
value?'
he
asked.
"'Not
at
all.
I
only
doubt--'
"'The
propriety
of
my
leaving
it.
You
may
set
your
mind
at
rest
about
that.
I
should
not
dream
of
doing
so
were
it
not
absolutely
certain
that
I
should
be
able
in
four
days
to
reclaim
it.
It
is
a
pure
matter
of
form.
Is
the
security
sufficient?'
"'Ample.'
"'You
understand,
Mr.
Holder,
that
I
am
giving
you
a
strong
proof
of
the
confidence
which
I
have
in
you,
founded
upon
all
that
I
have
heard
of
you.
I
rely
upon
you
not
only
to
be
discreet
and
to
refrain
from
all
gossip
upon
the
matter
but,
above
all,
to
preserve
this
coronet
with
every
possible
precaution
because
I
need
not
say
that
a
great
public
scandal
would
be
caused
if
any
harm
were
to
befall
it.
Any
injury
to
it
would
be
almost
as
serious
as
its
complete
loss,
for
there
are
no
beryls
in
the
world
to
match
these,
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
replace
them.
I
leave
it
with
you,
however,
with
every
confidence,
and
I
shall
call
for
it
in
person
on
Monday
morning.'
"Seeing
that
my
client
was
anxious
to
leave,
I
said
no
more
but,
calling
for
my
cashier,
I
ordered
him
to
pay
over
fifty
1000
pound
notes.
When
I
was
alone
once
more,
however,
with
the
precious
case
lying
upon
the
table
in
front
of
me,
I
could
not
but
think
with
some
misgivings
of
the
immense
responsibility
which
it
entailed
upon
me.
There
could
be
no
doubt
that,
as
it
was
a
national
possession,
a
horrible
scandal
would
ensue
if
any
misfortune
should
occur
to
it.
I
already
regretted
having
ever
consented
to
take
charge
of
it.
However,
it
was
too
late
to
alter
the
matter
now,
so
I
locked
it
up
in
my
private
safe
and
turned
once
more
to
my
work.
"When
evening
came
I
felt
that
it
would
be
an
imprudence
to
leave
so
precious
a
thing
in
the
office
behind
me.
Bankers'
safes
had
been
forced
before
now,
and
why
should
not
mine
be?
If
so,
how
terrible
would
be
the
position
in
which
I
should
find
myself!
I
determined,
therefore,
that
for
the
next
few
days
I
would
always
carry
the
case
backward
and
forward
with
me,
so
that
it
might
never
be
really
out
of
my
reach.
With
this
intention,
I
called
a
cab
and
drove
out
to
my
house
at
Streatham,
carrying
the
jewel
with
me.
I
did
not
breathe
freely
until
I
had
taken
it
upstairs
and
locked
it
in
the
bureau
of
my
dressing-room.
"And
now
a
word
as
to
my
household,
Mr.
Holmes,
for
I
wish
you
to
thoroughly
understand
the
situation.
My
groom
and
my
page
sleep
out
of
the
house,
and
may
be
set
aside
altogether.
I
have
three
maid-servants
who
have
been
with
me
a
number
of
years
and
whose
absolute
reliability
is
quite
above
suspicion.
Another,
Lucy
Parr,
the
second
waiting-maid,
has
only
been
in
my
service
a
few
months.
She
came
with
an
excellent
character,
however,
and
has
always
given
me
satisfaction.
She
is
a
very
pretty
girl
and
has
attracted
admirers
who
have
occasionally
hung
about
the
place.
That
is
the
only
drawback
which
we
have
found
to
her,
but
we
believe
her
to
be
a
thoroughly
good
girl
in
every
way.
"So
much
for
the
servants.
My
family
itself
is
so
small
that
it
will
not
take
me
long
to
describe
it.
I
am
a
widower
and
have
an
only
son,
Arthur.
He
has
been
a
disappointment
to
me,
Mr.
Holmes--a
grievous
disappointment.
I
have
no
doubt
that
I
am
myself
to
blame.
People
tell
me
that
I
have
spoiled
him.
Very
likely
I
have.
When
my
dear
wife
died
I
felt
that
he
was
all
I
had
to
love.
I
could
not
bear
to
see
the
smile
fade
even
for
a
moment
from
his
face.
I
have
never
denied
him
a
wish.
Perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
for
both
of
us
had
I
been
sterner,
but
I
meant
it
for
the
best.
"It
was
naturally
my
intention
that
he
should
succeed
me
in
my
business,
but
he
was
not
of
a
business
turn.
He
was
wild,
wayward,
and,
to
speak
the
truth,
I
could
not
trust
him
in
the
handling
of
large
sums
of
money.
When
he
was
young
he
became
a
member
of
an
aristocratic
club,
and
there,
having
charming
manners,
he
was
soon
the
intimate
of
a
number
of
men
with
long
purses
and
expensive
habits.
He
learned
to
play
heavily
at
cards
and
to
squander
money
on
the
turf,
until
he
had
again
and
again
to
come
to
me
and
implore
me
to
give
him
an
advance
upon
his
allowance,
that
he
might
settle
his
debts
of
honour.
He
tried
more
than
once
to
break
away
from
the
dangerous
company
which
he
was
keeping,
but
each
time
the
influence
of
his
friend,
Sir
George
Burnwell,
was
enough
to
draw
him
back
again.
"And,
indeed,
I
could
not
wonder
that
such
a
man
as
Sir
George
Burnwell
should
gain
an
influence
over
him,
for
he
has
frequently
brought
him
to
my
house,
and
I
have
found
myself
that
I
could
hardly
resist
the
fascination
of
his
manner.
He
is
older
than
Arthur,
a
man
of
the
world
to
his
finger-tips,
one
who
had
been
everywhere,
seen
everything,
a
brilliant
talker,
and
a
man
of
great
personal
beauty.
Yet
when
I
think
of
him
in
cold
blood,
far
away
from
the
glamour
of
his
presence,
I
am
convinced
from
his
cynical
speech
and
the
look
which
I
have
caught
in
his
eyes
that
he
is
one
who
should
be
deeply
distrusted.
So
I
think,
and
so,
too,
thinks
my
little
Mary,
who
has
a
woman's
quick
insight
into
character.
"And
now
there
is
only
she
to
be
described.
She
is
my
niece;
but
when
my
brother
died
five
years
ago
and
left
her
alone
in
the
world
I
adopted
her,
and
have
looked
upon
her
ever
since
as
my
daughter.
She
is
a
sunbeam
in
my
house--sweet,
loving,
beautiful,
a
wonderful
manager
and
housekeeper,
yet
as
tender
and
quiet
and
gentle
as
a
woman
could
be.
She
is
my
right
hand.
I
do
not
know
what
I
could
do
without
her.
In
only
one
matter
has
she
ever
gone
against
my
wishes.
Twice
my
boy
has
asked
her
to
marry
him,
for
he
loves
her
devotedly,
but
each
time
she
has
refused
him.
I
think
that
if
anyone
could
have
drawn
him
into
the
right
path
it
would
have
been
she,
and
that
his
marriage
might
have
changed
his
whole
life;
but
now,
alas!
it
is
too
late--forever
too
late!
"Now,
Mr.
Holmes,
you
know
the
people
who
live
under
my
roof,
and
I
shall
continue
with
my
miserable
story.
"When
we
were
taking
coffee
in
the
drawing-room
that
night
after
dinner,
I
told
Arthur
and
Mary
my
experience,
and
of
the
precious
treasure
which
we
had
under
our
roof,
suppressing
only
the
name
of
my
client.
Lucy
Parr,
who
had
brought
in
the
coffee,
had,
I
am
sure,
left
the
room;
but
I
cannot
swear
that
the
door
was
closed.
Mary
and
Arthur
were
much
interested
and
wished
to
see
the
famous
coronet,
but
I
thought
it
better
not
to
disturb
it.
"'Where
have
you
put
it?'
asked
Arthur.
"'In
my
own
bureau.'
"'Well,
I
hope
to
goodness
the
house
won't
be
burgled
during
the
night.'
said
he.
"'It
is
locked
up,'
I
answered.
"'Oh,
any
old
key
will
fit
that
bureau.
When
I
was
a
youngster
I
have
opened
it
myself
with
the
key
of
the
box-room
cupboard.'
"He
often
had
a
wild
way
of
talking,
so
that
I
thought
little
of
what
he
said.
He
followed
me
to
my
room,
however,
that
night
with
a
very
grave
face.
"'Look
here,
dad,'
said
he
with
his
eyes
cast
down,
'can
you
let
me
have
200
pounds?'
"'No,
I
cannot!'
I
answered
sharply.
'I
have
been
far
too
generous
with
you
in
money
matters.'
"'You
have
been
very
kind,'
said
he,
'but
I
must
have
this
money,
or
else
I
can
never
show
my
face
inside
the
club
again.'
"'And
a
very
good
thing,
too!'
I
cried.
"'Yes,
but
you
would
not
have
me
leave
it
a
dishonoured
man,'
said
he.
'I
could
not
bear
the
disgrace.
I
must
raise
the
money
in
some
way,
and
if
you
will
not
let
me
have
it,
then
I
must
try
other
means.'
"I
was
very
angry,
for
this
was
the
third
demand
during
the
month.
'You
shall
not
have
a
farthing
from
me,'
I
cried,
on
which
he
bowed
and
left
the
room
without
another
word.
"When
he
was
gone
I
unlocked
my
bureau,
made
sure
that
my
treasure
was
safe,
and
locked
it
again.
Then
I
started
to
go
round
the
house
to
see
that
all
was
secure--a
duty
which
I
usually
leave
to
Mary
but
which
I
thought
it
well
to
perform
myself
that
night.
As
I
came
down
the
stairs
I
saw
Mary
herself
at
the
side
window
of
the
hall,
which
she
closed
and
fastened
as
I
approached.
"'Tell
me,
dad,'
said
she,
looking,
I
thought,
a
little
disturbed,
'did
you
give
Lucy,
the
maid,
leave
to
go
out
to-night?'
"'Certainly
not.'
"'She
came
in
just
now
by
the
back
door.
I
have
no
doubt
that
she
has
only
been
to
the
side
gate
to
see
someone,
but
I
think
that
it
is
hardly
safe
and
should
be
stopped.'
"'You
must
speak
to
her
in
the
morning,
or
I
will
if
you
prefer
it.
Are
you
sure
that
everything
is
fastened?'
"'Quite
sure,
dad.'
"'Then,
good-night.'
I
kissed
her
and
went
up
to
my
bedroom
again,
where
I
was
soon
asleep.
"I
am
endeavouring
to
tell
you
everything,
Mr.
Holmes,
which
may
have
any
bearing
upon
the
case,
but
I
beg
that
you
will
question
me
upon
any
point
which
I
do
not
make
clear."
"On
the
contrary,
your
statement
is
singularly
lucid."
"I
come
to
a
part
of
my
story
now
in
which
I
should
wish
to
be
particularly
so.
I
am
not
a
very
heavy
sleeper,
and
the
anxiety
in
my
mind
tended,
no
doubt,
to
make
me
even
less
so
than
usual.
About
two
in
the
morning,
then,
I
was
awakened
by
some
sound
in
the
house.
It
had
ceased
ere
I
was
wide
awake,
but
it
had
left
an
impression
behind
it
as
though
a
window
had
gently
closed
somewhere.
I
lay
listening
with
all
my
ears.
Suddenly,
to
my
horror,
there
was
a
distinct
sound
of
footsteps
moving
softly
in
the
next
room.
I
slipped
out
of
bed,
all
palpitating
with
fear,
and
peeped
round
the
corner
of
my
dressing-room
door.
"'Arthur!'
I
screamed,
'you
villain!
you
thief!
How
dare
you
touch
that
coronet?'
"The
gas
was
half
up,
as
I
had
left
it,
and
my
unhappy
boy,
dressed
only
in
his
shirt
and
trousers,
was
standing
beside
the
light,
holding
the
coronet
in
his
hands.
He
appeared
to
be
wrenching
at
it,
or
bending
it
with
all
his
strength.
At
my
cry
he
dropped
it
from
his
grasp
and
turned
as
pale
as
death.
I
snatched
it
up
and
examined
it.
One
of
the
gold
corners,
with
three
of
the
beryls
in
it,
was
missing.
"'You
blackguard!'
I
shouted,
beside
myself
with
rage.
'You
have
destroyed
it!
You
have
dishonoured
me
forever!
Where
are
the
jewels
which
you
have
stolen?'
"'Stolen!'
he
cried.
"'Yes,
thief!'
I
roared,
shaking
him
by
the
shoulder.
"'There
are
none
missing.
There
cannot
be
any
missing,'
said
he.
"'There
are
three
missing.
And
you
know
where
they
are.
Must
I
call
you
a
liar
as
well
as
a
thief?
Did
I
not
see
you
trying
to
tear
off
another
piece?'
"'You
have
called
me
names
enough,'
said
he,
'I
will
not
stand
it
any
longer.
I
shall
not
say
another
word
about
this
business,
since
you
have
chosen
to
insult
me.
I
will
leave
your
house
in
the
morning
and
make
my
own
way
in
the
world.'
"'You
shall
leave
it
in
the
hands
of
the
police!'
I
cried
half-mad
with
grief
and
rage.
'I
shall
have
this
matter
probed
to
the
bottom.'
"'You
shall
learn
nothing
from
me,'
said
he
with
a
passion
such
as
I
should
not
have
thought
was
in
his
nature.
'If
you
choose
to
call
the
police,
let
the
police
find
what
they
can.'
"By
this
time
the
whole
house
was
astir,
for
I
had
raised
my
voice
in
my
anger.
Mary
was
the
first
to
rush
into
my
room,
and,
at
the
sight
of
the
coronet
and
of
Arthur's
face,
she
read
the
whole
story
and,
with
a
scream,
fell
down
senseless
on
the
ground.
I
sent
the
house-maid
for
the
police
and
put
the
investigation
into
their
hands
at
once.
When
the
inspector
and
a
constable
entered
the
house,
Arthur,
who
had
stood
sullenly
with
his
arms
folded,
asked
me
whether
it
was
my
intention
to
charge
him
with
theft.
I
answered
that
it
had
ceased
to
be
a
private
matter,
but
had
become
a
public
one,
since
the
ruined
coronet
was
national
property.
I
was
determined
that
the
law
should
have
its
way
in
everything.
"'At
least,'
said
he,
'you
will
not
have
me
arrested
at
once.
It
would
be
to
your
advantage
as
well
as
mine
if
I
might
leave
the
house
for
five
minutes.'
"'That
you
may
get
away,
or
perhaps
that
you
may
conceal
what
you
have
stolen,'
said
I.
And
then,
realising
the
dreadful
position
in
which
I
was
placed,
I
implored
him
to
remember
that
not
only
my
honour
but
that
of
one
who
was
far
greater
than
I
was
at
stake;
and
that
he
threatened
to
raise
a
scandal
which
would
convulse
the
nation.
He
might
avert
it
all
if
he
would
but
tell
me
what
he
had
done
with
the
three
missing
stones.
"'You
may
as
well
face
the
matter,'
said
I;
'you
have
been
caught
in
the
act,
and
no
confession
could
make
your
guilt
more
heinous.
If
you
but
make
such
reparation
as
is
in
your
power,
by
telling
us
where
the
beryls
are,
all
shall
be
forgiven
and
forgotten.'
"'Keep
your
forgiveness
for
those
who
ask
for
it,'
he
answered,
turning
away
from
me
with
a
sneer.
I
saw
that
he
was
too
hardened
for
any
words
of
mine
to
influence
him.
There
was
but
one
way
for
it.
I
called
in
the
inspector
and
gave
him
into
custody.
A
search
was
made
at
once
not
only
of
his
person
but
of
his
room
and
of
every
portion
of
the
house
where
he
could
possibly
have
concealed
the
gems;
but
no
trace
of
them
could
be
found,
nor
would
the
wretched
boy
open
his
mouth
for
all
our
persuasions
and
our
threats.
This
morning
he
was
removed
to
a
cell,
and
I,
after
going
through
all
the
police
formalities,
have
hurried
round
to
you
to
implore
you
to
use
your
skill
in
unravelling
the
matter.
The
police
have
openly
confessed
that
they
can
at
present
make
nothing
of
it.
You
may
go
to
any
expense
which
you
think
necessary.
I
have
already
offered
a
reward
of
1000
pounds.
My
God,
what
shall
I
do!
I
have
lost
my
honour,
my
gems,
and
my
son
in
one
night.
Oh,
what
shall
I
do!"
He
put
a
hand
on
either
side
of
his
head
and
rocked
himself
to
and
fro,
droning
to
himself
like
a
child
whose
grief
has
got
beyond
words.
Sherlock
Holmes
sat
silent
for
some
few
minutes,
with
his
brows
knitted
and
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
fire.
"Do
you
receive
much
company?"
he
asked.
"None
save
my
partner
with
his
family
and
an
occasional
friend
of
Arthur's.
Sir
George
Burnwell
has
been
several
times
lately.
No
one
else,
I
think."
"Do
you
go
out
much
in
society?"
"Arthur
does.
Mary
and
I
stay
at
home.
We
neither
of
us
care
for
it."
"That
is
unusual
in
a
young
girl."
"She
is
of
a
quiet
nature.
Besides,
she
is
not
so
very
young.
She
is
four-and-twenty."
"This
matter,
from
what
you
say,
seems
to
have
been
a
shock
to
her
also."
"Terrible!
She
is
even
more
affected
than
I."
"You
have
neither
of
you
any
doubt
as
to
your
son's
guilt?"
"How
can
we
have
when
I
saw
him
with
my
own
eyes
with
the
coronet
in
his
hands."
"I
hardly
consider
that
a
conclusive
proof.
Was
the
remainder
of
the
coronet
at
all
injured?"
"Yes,
it
was
twisted."
"Do
you
not
think,
then,
that
he
might
have
been
trying
to
straighten
it?"
"God
bless
you!
You
are
doing
what
you
can
for
him
and
for
me.
But
it
is
too
heavy
a
task.
What
was
he
doing
there
at
all?
If
his
purpose
were
innocent,
why
did
he
not
say
so?"
"Precisely.
And
if
it
were
guilty,
why
did
he
not
invent
a
lie?
His
silence
appears
to
me
to
cut
both
ways.
There
are
several
singular
points
about
the
case.
What
did
the
police
think
of
the
noise
which
awoke
you
from
your
sleep?"
"They
considered
that
it
might
be
caused
by
Arthur's
closing
his
bedroom
door."
"A
likely
story!
As
if
a
man
bent
on
felony
would
slam
his
door
so
as
to
wake
a
household.
What
did
they
say,
then,
of
the
disappearance
of
these
gems?"
"They
are
still
sounding
the
planking
and
probing
the
furniture
in
the
hope
of
finding
them."
"Have
they
thought
of
looking
outside
the
house?"
"Yes,
they
have
shown
extraordinary
energy.
The
whole
garden
has
already
been
minutely
examined."
"Now,
my
dear
sir,"
said
Holmes,
"is
it
not
obvious
to
you
now
that
this
matter
really
strikes
very
much
deeper
than
either
you
or
the
police
were
at
first
inclined
to
think?
It
appeared
to
you
to
be
a
simple
case;
to
me
it
seems
exceedingly
complex.
Consider
what
is
involved
by
your
theory.
You
suppose
that
your
son
came
down
from
his
bed,
went,
at
great
risk,
to
your
dressing-room,
opened
your
bureau,
took
out
your
coronet,
broke
off
by
main
force
a
small
portion
of
it,
went
off
to
some
other
place,
concealed
three
gems
out
of
the
thirty-nine,
with
such
skill
that
nobody
can
find
them,
and
then
returned
with
the
other
thirty-six
into
the
room
in
which
he
exposed
himself
to
the
greatest
danger
of
being
discovered.
I
ask
you
now,
is
such
a
theory
tenable?"
"But
what
other
is
there?"
cried
the
banker
with
a
gesture
of
despair.
"If
his
motives
were
innocent,
why
does
he
not
explain
them?"
"It
is
our
task
to
find
that
out,"
replied
Holmes;
"so
now,
if
you
please,
Mr.
Holder,
we
will
set
off
for
Streatham
together,
and
devote
an
hour
to
glancing
a
little
more
closely
into
details."
My
friend
insisted
upon
my
accompanying
them
in
their
expedition,
which
I
was
eager
enough
to
do,
for
my
curiosity
and
sympathy
were
deeply
stirred
by
the
story
to
which
we
had
listened.
I
confess
that
the
guilt
of
the
banker's
son
appeared
to
me
to
be
as
obvious
as
it
did
to
his
unhappy
father,
but
still
I
had
such
faith
in
Holmes'
judgment
that
I
felt
that
there
must
be
some
grounds
for
hope
as
long
as
he
was
dissatisfied
with
the
accepted
explanation.
He
hardly
spoke
a
word
the
whole
way
out
to
the
southern
suburb,
but
sat
with
his
chin
upon
his
breast
and
his
hat
drawn
over
his
eyes,
sunk
in
the
deepest
thought.
Our
client
appeared
to
have
taken
fresh
heart
at
the
little
glimpse
of
hope
which
had
been
presented
to
him,
and
he
even
broke
into
a
desultory
chat
with
me
over
his
business
affairs.
A
short
railway
journey
and
a
shorter
walk
brought
us
to
Fairbank,
the
modest
residence
of
the
great
financier.
Fairbank
was
a
good-sized
square
house
of
white
stone,
standing
back
a
little
from
the
road.
A
double
carriage-sweep,
with
a
snow-clad
lawn,
stretched
down
in
front
to
two
large
iron
gates
which
closed
the
entrance.
On
the
right
side
was
a
small
wooden
thicket,
which
led
into
a
narrow
path
between
two
neat
hedges
stretching
from
the
road
to
the
kitchen
door,
and
forming
the
tradesmen's
entrance.
On
the
left
ran
a
lane
which
led
to
the
stables,
and
was
not
itself
within
the
grounds
at
all,
being
a
public,
though
little
used,
thoroughfare.
Holmes
left
us
standing
at
the
door
and
walked
slowly
all
round
the
house,
across
the
front,
down
the
tradesmen's
path,
and
so
round
by
the
garden
behind
into
the
stable
lane.
So
long
was
he
that
Mr.
Holder
and
I
went
into
the
dining-room
and
waited
by
the
fire
until
he
should
return.
We
were
sitting
there
in
silence
when
the
door
opened
and
a
young
lady
came
in.
She
was
rather
above
the
middle
height,
slim,
with
dark
hair
and
eyes,
which
seemed
the
darker
against
the
absolute
pallor
of
her
skin.
I
do
not
think
that
I
have
ever
seen
such
deadly
paleness
in
a
woman's
face.
Her
lips,
too,
were
bloodless,
but
her
eyes
were
flushed
with
crying.
As
she
swept
silently
into
the
room
she
impressed
me
with
a
greater
sense
of
grief
than
the
banker
had
done
in
the
morning,
and
it
was
the
more
striking
in
her
as
she
was
evidently
a
woman
of
strong
character,
with
immense
capacity
for
self-restraint.
Disregarding
my
presence,
she
went
straight
to
her
uncle
and
passed
her
hand
over
his
head
with
a
sweet
womanly
caress.
"You
have
given
orders
that
Arthur
should
be
liberated,
have
you
not,
dad?"
she
asked.
"No,
no,
my
girl,
the
matter
must
be
probed
to
the
bottom."
"But
I
am
so
sure
that
he
is
innocent.
You
know
what
woman's
instincts
are.
I
know
that
he
has
done
no
harm
and
that
you
will
be
sorry
for
having
acted
so
harshly."
"Why
is
he
silent,
then,
if
he
is
innocent?"
"Who
knows?
Perhaps
because
he
was
so
angry
that
you
should
suspect
him."
"How
could
I
help
suspecting
him,
when
I
actually
saw
him
with
the
coronet
in
his
hand?"
"Oh,
but
he
had
only
picked
it
up
to
look
at
it.
Oh,
do,
do
take
my
word
for
it
that
he
is
innocent.
Let
the
matter
drop
and
say
no
more.
It
is
so
dreadful
to
think
of
our
dear
Arthur
in
prison!"
"I
shall
never
let
it
drop
until
the
gems
are
found--never,
Mary!
Your
affection
for
Arthur
blinds
you
as
to
the
awful
consequences
to
me.
Far
from
hushing
the
thing
up,
I
have
brought
a
gentleman
down
from
London
to
inquire
more
deeply
into
it."
"This
gentleman?"
she
asked,
facing
round
to
me.
"No,
his
friend.
He
wished
us
to
leave
him
alone.
He
is
round
in
the
stable
lane
now."
"The
stable
lane?"
She
raised
her
dark
eyebrows.
"What
can
he
hope
to
find
there?
Ah!
this,
I
suppose,
is
he.
I
trust,
sir,
that
you
will
succeed
in
proving,
what
I
feel
sure
is
the
truth,
that
my
cousin
Arthur
is
innocent
of
this
crime."
"I
fully
share
your
opinion,
and
I
trust,
with
you,
that
we
may
prove
it,"
returned
Holmes,
going
back
to
the
mat
to
knock
the
snow
from
his
shoes.
"I
believe
I
have
the
honour
of
addressing
Miss
Mary
Holder.
Might
I
ask
you
a
question
or
two?"
"Pray
do,
sir,
if
it
may
help
to
clear
this
horrible
affair
up."
"You
heard
nothing
yourself
last
night?"
"Nothing,
until
my
uncle
here
began
to
speak
loudly.
I
heard
that,
and
I
came
down."
"You
shut
up
the
windows
and
doors
the
night
before.
Did
you
fasten
all
the
windows?"
"Yes."
"Were
they
all
fastened
this
morning?"
"Yes."
"You
have
a
maid
who
has
a
sweetheart?
I
think
that
you
remarked
to
your
uncle
last
night
that
she
had
been
out
to
see
him?"
"Yes,
and
she
was
the
girl
who
waited
in
the
drawing-room,
and
who
may
have
heard
uncle's
remarks
about
the
coronet."
"I
see.
You
infer
that
she
may
have
gone
out
to
tell
her
sweetheart,
and
that
the
two
may
have
planned
the
robbery."
"But
what
is
the
good
of
all
these
vague
theories,"
cried
the
banker
impatiently,
"when
I
have
told
you
that
I
saw
Arthur
with
the
coronet
in
his
hands?"
"Wait
a
little,
Mr.
Holder.
We
must
come
back
to
that.
About
this
girl,
Miss
Holder.
You
saw
her
return
by
the
kitchen
door,
I
presume?"
"Yes;
when
I
went
to
see
if
the
door
was
fastened
for
the
night
I
met
her
slipping
in.
I
saw
the
man,
too,
in
the
gloom."
"Do
you
know
him?"
"Oh,
yes!
he
is
the
green-grocer
who
brings
our
vegetables
round.
His
name
is
Francis
Prosper."
"He
stood,"
said
Holmes,
"to
the
left
of
the
door--that
is
to
say,
farther
up
the
path
than
is
necessary
to
reach
the
door?"
"Yes,
he
did."
"And
he
is
a
man
with
a
wooden
leg?"
Something
like
fear
sprang
up
in
the
young
lady's
expressive
black
eyes.
"Why,
you
are
like
a
magician,"
said
she.
"How
do
you
know
that?"
She
smiled,
but
there
was
no
answering
smile
in
Holmes'
thin,
eager
face.
"I
should
be
very
glad
now
to
go
upstairs,"
said
he.
"I
shall
probably
wish
to
go
over
the
outside
of
the
house
again.
Perhaps
I
had
better
take
a
look
at
the
lower
windows
before
I
go
up."
He
walked
swiftly
round
from
one
to
the
other,
pausing
only
at
the
large
one
which
looked
from
the
hall
onto
the
stable
lane.
This
he
opened
and
made
a
very
careful
examination
of
the
sill
with
his
powerful
magnifying
lens.
"Now
we
shall
go
upstairs,"
said
he
at
last.
The
banker's
dressing-room
was
a
plainly
furnished
little
chamber,
with
a
grey
carpet,
a
large
bureau,
and
a
long
mirror.
Holmes
went
to
the
bureau
first
and
looked
hard
at
the
lock.
"Which
key
was
used
to
open
it?"
he
asked.
"That
which
my
son
himself
indicated--that
of
the
cupboard
of
the
lumber-room."
"Have
you
it
here?"
"That
is
it
on
the
dressing-table."
Sherlock
Holmes
took
it
up
and
opened
the
bureau.
"It
is
a
noiseless
lock,"
said
he.
"It
is
no
wonder
that
it
did
not
wake
you.
This
case,
I
presume,
contains
the
coronet.
We
must
have
a
look
at
it."
He
opened
the
case,
and
taking
out
the
diadem
he
laid
it
upon
the
table.
It
was
a
magnificent
specimen
of
the
jeweller's
art,
and
the
thirty-six
stones
were
the
finest
that
I
have
ever
seen.
At
one
side
of
the
coronet
was
a
cracked
edge,
where
a
corner
holding
three
gems
had
been
torn
away.
"Now,
Mr.
Holder,"
said
Holmes,
"here
is
the
corner
which
corresponds
to
that
which
has
been
so
unfortunately
lost.
Might
I
beg
that
you
will
break
it
off."
The
banker
recoiled
in
horror.
"I
should
not
dream
of
trying,"
said
he.
"Then
I
will."
Holmes
suddenly
bent
his
strength
upon
it,
but
without
result.
"I
feel
it
give
a
little,"
said
he;
"but,
though
I
am
exceptionally
strong
in
the
fingers,
it
would
take
me
all
my
time
to
break
it.
An
ordinary
man
could
not
do
it.
Now,
what
do
you
think
would
happen
if
I
did
break
it,
Mr.
Holder?
There
would
be
a
noise
like
a
pistol
shot.
Do
you
tell
me
that
all
this
happened
within
a
few
yards
of
your
bed
and
that
you
heard
nothing
of
it?"
"I
do
not
know
what
to
think.
It
is
all
dark
to
me."
"But
perhaps
it
may
grow
lighter
as
we
go.
What
do
you
think,
Miss
Holder?"
"I
confess
that
I
still
share
my
uncle's
perplexity."
"Your
son
had
no
shoes
or
slippers
on
when
you
saw
him?"
"He
had
nothing
on
save
only
his
trousers
and
shirt."
"Thank
you.
We
have
certainly
been
favoured
with
extraordinary
luck
during
this
inquiry,
and
it
will
be
entirely
our
own
fault
if
we
do
not
succeed
in
clearing
the
matter
up.
With
your
permission,
Mr.
Holder,
I
shall
now
continue
my
investigations
outside."
He
went
alone,
at
his
own
request,
for
he
explained
that
any
unnecessary
footmarks
might
make
his
task
more
difficult.
For
an
hour
or
more
he
was
at
work,
returning
at
last
with
his
feet
heavy
with
snow
and
his
features
as
inscrutable
as
ever.
"I
think
that
I
have
seen
now
all
that
there
is
to
see,
Mr.
Holder,"
said
he;
"I
can
serve
you
best
by
returning
to
my
rooms."
"But
the
gems,
Mr.
Holmes.
Where
are
they?"
"I
cannot
tell."
The
banker
wrung
his
hands.
"I
shall
never
see
them
again!"
he
cried.
"And
my
son?
You
give
me
hopes?"
"My
opinion
is
in
no
way
altered."
"Then,
for
God's
sake,
what
was
this
dark
business
which
was
acted
in
my
house
last
night?"
"If
you
can
call
upon
me
at
my
Baker
Street
rooms
to-morrow
morning
between
nine
and
ten
I
shall
be
happy
to
do
what
I
can
to
make
it
clearer.
I
understand
that
you
give
me
carte
blanche
to
act
for
you,
provided
only
that
I
get
back
the
gems,
and
that
you
place
no
limit
on
the
sum
I
may
draw."
"I
would
give
my
fortune
to
have
them
back."
"Very
good.
I
shall
look
into
the
matter
between
this
and
then.
Good-bye;
it
is
just
possible
that
I
may
have
to
come
over
here
again
before
evening."
It
was
obvious
to
me
that
my
companion's
mind
was
now
made
up
about
the
case,
although
what
his
conclusions
were
was
more
than
I
could
even
dimly
imagine.
Several
times
during
our
homeward
journey
I
endeavoured
to
sound
him
upon
the
point,
but
he
always
glided
away
to
some
other
topic,
until
at
last
I
gave
it
over
in
despair.
It
was
not
yet
three
when
we
found
ourselves
in
our
rooms
once
more.
He
hurried
to
his
chamber
and
was
down
again
in
a
few
minutes
dressed
as
a
common
loafer.
With
his
collar
turned
up,
his
shiny,
seedy
coat,
his
red
cravat,
and
his
worn
boots,
he
was
a
perfect
sample
of
the
class.
"I
think
that
this
should
do,"
said
he,
glancing
into
the
glass
above
the
fireplace.
"I
only
wish
that
you
could
come
with
me,
Watson,
but
I
fear
that
it
won't
do.
I
may
be
on
the
trail
in
this
matter,
or
I
may
be
following
a
will-o'-the-wisp,
but
I
shall
soon
know
which
it
is.
I
hope
that
I
may
be
back
in
a
few
hours."
He
cut
a
slice
of
beef
from
the
joint
upon
the
sideboard,
sandwiched
it
between
two
rounds
of
bread,
and
thrusting
this
rude
meal
into
his
pocket
he
started
off
upon
his
expedition.
I
had
just
finished
my
tea
when
he
returned,
evidently
in
excellent
spirits,
swinging
an
old
elastic-sided
boot
in
his
hand.
He
chucked
it
down
into
a
corner
and
helped
himself
to
a
cup
of
tea.
"I
only
looked
in
as
I
passed,"
said
he.
"I
am
going
right
on."
"Where
to?"
"Oh,
to
the
other
side
of
the
West
End.
It
may
be
some
time
before
I
get
back.
Don't
wait
up
for
me
in
case
I
should
be
late."
"How
are
you
getting
on?"
"Oh,
so
so.
Nothing
to
complain
of.
I
have
been
out
to
Streatham
since
I
saw
you
last,
but
I
did
not
call
at
the
house.
It
is
a
very
sweet
little
problem,
and
I
would
not
have
missed
it
for
a
good
deal.
However,
I
must
not
sit
gossiping
here,
but
must
get
these
disreputable
clothes
off
and
return
to
my
highly
respectable
self."
I
could
see
by
his
manner
that
he
had
stronger
reasons
for
satisfaction
than
his
words
alone
would
imply.
His
eyes
twinkled,
and
there
was
even
a
touch
of
colour
upon
his
sallow
cheeks.
He
hastened
upstairs,
and
a
few
minutes
later
I
heard
the
slam
of
the
hall
door,
which
told
me
that
he
was
off
once
more
upon
his
congenial
hunt.
I
waited
until
midnight,
but
there
was
no
sign
of
his
return,
so
I
retired
to
my
room.
It
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
him
to
be
away
for
days
and
nights
on
end
when
he
was
hot
upon
a
scent,
so
that
his
lateness
caused
me
no
surprise.
I
do
not
know
at
what
hour
he
came
in,
but
when
I
came
down
to
breakfast
in
the
morning
there
he
was
with
a
cup
of
coffee
in
one
hand
and
the
paper
in
the
other,
as
fresh
and
trim
as
possible.
"You
will
excuse
my
beginning
without
you,
Watson,"
said
he,
"but
you
remember
that
our
client
has
rather
an
early
appointment
this
morning."
"Why,
it
is
after
nine
now,"
I
answered.
"I
should
not
be
surprised
if
that
were
he.
I
thought
I
heard
a
ring."
It
was,
indeed,
our
friend
the
financier.
I
was
shocked
by
the
change
which
had
come
over
him,
for
his
face
which
was
naturally
of
a
broad
and
massive
mould,
was
now
pinched
and
fallen
in,
while
his
hair
seemed
to
me
at
least
a
shade
whiter.
He
entered
with
a
weariness
and
lethargy
which
was
even
more
painful
than
his
violence
of
the
morning
before,
and
he
dropped
heavily
into
the
armchair
which
I
pushed
forward
for
him.
"I
do
not
know
what
I
have
done
to
be
so
severely
tried,"
said
he.
"Only
two
days
ago
I
was
a
happy
and
prosperous
man,
without
a
care
in
the
world.
Now
I
am
left
to
a
lonely
and
dishonoured
age.
One
sorrow
comes
close
upon
the
heels
of
another.
My
niece,
Mary,
has
deserted
me."
"Deserted
you?"
"Yes.
Her
bed
this
morning
had
not
been
slept
in,
her
room
was
empty,
and
a
note
for
me
lay
upon
the
hall
table.
I
had
said
to
her
last
night,
in
sorrow
and
not
in
anger,
that
if
she
had
married
my
boy
all
might
have
been
well
with
him.
Perhaps
it
was
thoughtless
of
me
to
say
so.
It
is
to
that
remark
that
she
refers
in
this
note:
"'MY
DEAREST
UNCLE:--I
feel
that
I
have
brought
trouble
upon
you,
and
that
if
I
had
acted
differently
this
terrible
misfortune
might
never
have
occurred.
I
cannot,
with
this
thought
in
my
mind,
ever
again
be
happy
under
your
roof,
and
I
feel
that
I
must
leave
you
forever.
Do
not
worry
about
my
future,
for
that
is
provided
for;
and,
above
all,
do
not
search
for
me,
for
it
will
be
fruitless
labour
and
an
ill-service
to
me.
In
life
or
in
death,
I
am
ever
your
loving,--MARY.'
"What
could
she
mean
by
that
note,
Mr.
Holmes?
Do
you
think
it
points
to
suicide?"
"No,
no,
nothing
of
the
kind.
It
is
perhaps
the
best
possible
solution.
I
trust,
Mr.
Holder,
that
you
are
nearing
the
end
of
your
troubles."
"Ha!
You
say
so!
You
have
heard
something,
Mr.
Holmes;
you
have
learned
something!
Where
are
the
gems?"
"You
would
not
think
1000
pounds
apiece
an
excessive
sum
for
them?"
"I
would
pay
ten."
"That
would
be
unnecessary.
Three
thousand
will
cover
the
matter.
And
there
is
a
little
reward,
I
fancy.
Have
you
your
check-book?
Here
is
a
pen.
Better
make
it
out
for
4000
pounds."
With
a
dazed
face
the
banker
made
out
the
required
check.
Holmes
walked
over
to
his
desk,
took
out
a
little
triangular
piece
of
gold
with
three
gems
in
it,
and
threw
it
down
upon
the
table.
With
a
shriek
of
joy
our
client
clutched
it
up.
"You
have
it!"
he
gasped.
"I
am
saved!
I
am
saved!"
The
reaction
of
joy
was
as
passionate
as
his
grief
had
been,
and
he
hugged
his
recovered
gems
to
his
bosom.
"There
is
one
other
thing
you
owe,
Mr.
Holder,"
said
Sherlock
Holmes
rather
sternly.
"Owe!"
He
caught
up
a
pen.
"Name
the
sum,
and
I
will
pay
it."
"No,
the
debt
is
not
to
me.
You
owe
a
very
humble
apology
to
that
noble
lad,
your
son,
who
has
carried
himself
in
this
matter
as
I
should
be
proud
to
see
my
own
son
do,
should
I
ever
chance
to
have
one."
"Then
it
was
not
Arthur
who
took
them?"
"I
told
you
yesterday,
and
I
repeat
to-day,
that
it
was
not."
"You
are
sure
of
it!
Then
let
us
hurry
to
him
at
once
to
let
him
know
that
the
truth
is
known."
"He
knows
it
already.
When
I
had
cleared
it
all
up
I
had
an
interview
with
him,
and
finding
that
he
would
not
tell
me
the
story,
I
told
it
to
him,
on
which
he
had
to
confess
that
I
was
right
and
to
add
the
very
few
details
which
were
not
yet
quite
clear
to
me.
Your
news
of
this
morning,
however,
may
open
his
lips."
"For
heaven's
sake,
tell
me,
then,
what
is
this
extraordinary
mystery!"
"I
will
do
so,
and
I
will
show
you
the
steps
by
which
I
reached
it.
And
let
me
say
to
you,
first,
that
which
it
is
hardest
for
me
to
say
and
for
you
to
hear:
there
has
been
an
understanding
between
Sir
George
Burnwell
and
your
niece
Mary.
They
have
now
fled
together."
"My
Mary?
Impossible!"
"It
is
unfortunately
more
than
possible;
it
is
certain.
Neither
you
nor
your
son
knew
the
true
character
of
this
man
when
you
admitted
him
into
your
family
circle.
He
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
men
in
England--a
ruined
gambler,
an
absolutely
desperate
villain,
a
man
without
heart
or
conscience.
Your
niece
knew
nothing
of
such
men.
When
he
breathed
his
vows
to
her,
as
he
had
done
to
a
hundred
before
her,
she
flattered
herself
that
she
alone
had
touched
his
heart.
The
devil
knows
best
what
he
said,
but
at
least
she
became
his
tool
and
was
in
the
habit
of
seeing
him
nearly
every
evening."
"I
cannot,
and
I
will
not,
believe
it!"
cried
the
banker
with
an
ashen
face.
"I
will
tell
you,
then,
what
occurred
in
your
house
last
night.
Your
niece,
when
you
had,
as
she
thought,
gone
to
your
room,
slipped
down
and
talked
to
her
lover
through
the
window
which
leads
into
the
stable
lane.
His
footmarks
had
pressed
right
through
the
snow,
so
long
had
he
stood
there.
She
told
him
of
the
coronet.
His
wicked
lust
for
gold
kindled
at
the
news,
and
he
bent
her
to
his
will.
I
have
no
doubt
that
she
loved
you,
but
there
are
women
in
whom
the
love
of
a
lover
extinguishes
all
other
loves,
and
I
think
that
she
must
have
been
one.
She
had
hardly
listened
to
his
instructions
when
she
saw
you
coming
downstairs,
on
which
she
closed
the
window
rapidly
and
told
you
about
one
of
the
servants'
escapade
with
her
wooden-legged
lover,
which
was
all
perfectly
true.
"Your
boy,
Arthur,
went
to
bed
after
his
interview
with
you
but
he
slept
badly
on
account
of
his
uneasiness
about
his
club
debts.
In
the
middle
of
the
night
he
heard
a
soft
tread
pass
his
door,
so
he
rose
and,
looking
out,
was
surprised
to
see
his
cousin
walking
very
stealthily
along
the
passage
until
she
disappeared
into
your
dressing-room.
Petrified
with
astonishment,
the
lad
slipped
on
some
clothes
and
waited
there
in
the
dark
to
see
what
would
come
of
this
strange
affair.
Presently
she
emerged
from
the
room
again,
and
in
the
light
of
the
passage-lamp
your
son
saw
that
she
carried
the
precious
coronet
in
her
hands.
She
passed
down
the
stairs,
and
he,
thrilling
with
horror,
ran
along
and
slipped
behind
the
curtain
near
your
door,
whence
he
could
see
what
passed
in
the
hall
beneath.
He
saw
her
stealthily
open
the
window,
hand
out
the
coronet
to
someone
in
the
gloom,
and
then
closing
it
once
more
hurry
back
to
her
room,
passing
quite
close
to
where
he
stood
hid
behind
the
curtain.
"As
long
as
she
was
on
the
scene
he
could
not
take
any
action
without
a
horrible
exposure
of
the
woman
whom
he
loved.
But
the
instant
that
she
was
gone
he
realised
how
crushing
a
misfortune
this
would
be
for
you,
and
how
all-important
it
was
to
set
it
right.
He
rushed
down,
just
as
he
was,
in
his
bare
feet,
opened
the
window,
sprang
out
into
the
snow,
and
ran
down
the
lane,
where
he
could
see
a
dark
figure
in
the
moonlight.
Sir
George
Burnwell
tried
to
get
away,
but
Arthur
caught
him,
and
there
was
a
struggle
between
them,
your
lad
tugging
at
one
side
of
the
coronet,
and
his
opponent
at
the
other.
In
the
scuffle,
your
son
struck
Sir
George
and
cut
him
over
the
eye.
Then
something
suddenly
snapped,
and
your
son,
finding
that
he
had
the
coronet
in
his
hands,
rushed
back,
closed
the
window,
ascended
to
your
room,
and
had
just
observed
that
the
coronet
had
been
twisted
in
the
struggle
and
was
endeavouring
to
straighten
it
when
you
appeared
upon
the
scene."
"Is
it
possible?"
gasped
the
banker.
"You
then
roused
his
anger
by
calling
him
names
at
a
moment
when
he
felt
that
he
had
deserved
your
warmest
thanks.
He
could
not
explain
the
true
state
of
affairs
without
betraying
one
who
certainly
deserved
little
enough
consideration
at
his
hands.
He
took
the
more
chivalrous
view,
however,
and
preserved
her
secret."
"And
that
was
why
she
shrieked
and
fainted
when
she
saw
the
coronet,"
cried
Mr.
Holder.
"Oh,
my
God!
what
a
blind
fool
I
have
been!
And
his
asking
to
be
allowed
to
go
out
for
five
minutes!
The
dear
fellow
wanted
to
see
if
the
missing
piece
were
at
the
scene
of
the
struggle.
How
cruelly
I
have
misjudged
him!"
"When
I
arrived
at
the
house,"
continued
Holmes,
"I
at
once
went
very
carefully
round
it
to
observe
if
there
were
any
traces
in
the
snow
which
might
help
me.
I
knew
that
none
had
fallen
since
the
evening
before,
and
also
that
there
had
been
a
strong
frost
to
preserve
impressions.
I
passed
along
the
tradesmen's
path,
but
found
it
all
trampled
down
and
indistinguishable.
Just
beyond
it,
however,
at
the
far
side
of
the
kitchen
door,
a
woman
had
stood
and
talked
with
a
man,
whose
round
impressions
on
one
side
showed
that
he
had
a
wooden
leg.
I
could
even
tell
that
they
had
been
disturbed,
for
the
woman
had
run
back
swiftly
to
the
door,
as
was
shown
by
the
deep
toe
and
light
heel
marks,
while
Wooden-leg
had
waited
a
little,
and
then
had
gone
away.
I
thought
at
the
time
that
this
might
be
the
maid
and
her
sweetheart,
of
whom
you
had
already
spoken
to
me,
and
inquiry
showed
it
was
so.
I
passed
round
the
garden
without
seeing
anything
more
than
random
tracks,
which
I
took
to
be
the
police;
but
when
I
got
into
the
stable
lane
a
very
long
and
complex
story
was
written
in
the
snow
in
front
of
me.
"There
was
a
double
line
of
tracks
of
a
booted
man,
and
a
second
double
line
which
I
saw
with
delight
belonged
to
a
man
with
naked
feet.
I
was
at
once
convinced
from
what
you
had
told
me
that
the
latter
was
your
son.
The
first
had
walked
both
ways,
but
the
other
had
run
swiftly,
and
as
his
tread
was
marked
in
places
over
the
depression
of
the
boot,
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
passed
after
the
other.
I
followed
them
up
and
found
they
led
to
the
hall
window,
where
Boots
had
worn
all
the
snow
away
while
waiting.
Then
I
walked
to
the
other
end,
which
was
a
hundred
yards
or
more
down
the
lane.
I
saw
where
Boots
had
faced
round,
where
the
snow
was
cut
up
as
though
there
had
been
a
struggle,
and,
finally,
where
a
few
drops
of
blood
had
fallen,
to
show
me
that
I
was
not
mistaken.
Boots
had
then
run
down
the
lane,
and
another
little
smudge
of
blood
showed
that
it
was
he
who
had
been
hurt.
When
he
came
to
the
highroad
at
the
other
end,
I
found
that
the
pavement
had
been
cleared,
so
there
was
an
end
to
that
clue.
"On
entering
the
house,
however,
I
examined,
as
you
remember,
the
sill
and
framework
of
the
hall
window
with
my
lens,
and
I
could
at
once
see
that
someone
had
passed
out.
I
could
distinguish
the
outline
of
an
instep
where
the
wet
foot
had
been
placed
in
coming
in.
I
was
then
beginning
to
be
able
to
form
an
opinion
as
to
what
had
occurred.
A
man
had
waited
outside
the
window;
someone
had
brought
the
gems;
the
deed
had
been
overseen
by
your
son;
he
had
pursued
the
thief;
had
struggled
with
him;
they
had
each
tugged
at
the
coronet,
their
united
strength
causing
injuries
which
neither
alone
could
have
effected.
He
had
returned
with
the
prize,
but
had
left
a
fragment
in
the
grasp
of
his
opponent.
So
far
I
was
clear.
The
question
now
was,
who
was
the
man
and
who
was
it
brought
him
the
coronet?
"It
is
an
old
maxim
of
mine
that
when
you
have
excluded
the
impossible,
whatever
remains,
however
improbable,
must
be
the
truth.
Now,
I
knew
that
it
was
not
you
who
had
brought
it
down,
so
there
only
remained
your
niece
and
the
maids.
But
if
it
were
the
maids,
why
should
your
son
allow
himself
to
be
accused
in
their
place?
There
could
be
no
possible
reason.
As
he
loved
his
cousin,
however,
there
was
an
excellent
explanation
why
he
should
retain
her
secret--the
more
so
as
the
secret
was
a
disgraceful
one.
When
I
remembered
that
you
had
seen
her
at
that
window,
and
how
she
had
fainted
on
seeing
the
coronet
again,
my
conjecture
became
a
certainty.
"And
who
could
it
be
who
was
her
confederate?
A
lover
evidently,
for
who
else
could
outweigh
the
love
and
gratitude
which
she
must
feel
to
you?
I
knew
that
you
went
out
little,
and
that
your
circle
of
friends
was
a
very
limited
one.
But
among
them
was
Sir
George
Burnwell.
I
had
heard
of
him
before
as
being
a
man
of
evil
reputation
among
women.
It
must
have
been
he
who
wore
those
boots
and
retained
the
missing
gems.
Even
though
he
knew
that
Arthur
had
discovered
him,
he
might
still
flatter
himself
that
he
was
safe,
for
the
lad
could
not
say
a
word
without
compromising
his
own
family.
"Well,
your
own
good
sense
will
suggest
what
measures
I
took
next.
I
went
in
the
shape
of
a
loafer
to
Sir
George's
house,
managed
to
pick
up
an
acquaintance
with
his
valet,
learned
that
his
master
had
cut
his
head
the
night
before,
and,
finally,
at
the
expense
of
six
shillings,
made
all
sure
by
buying
a
pair
of
his
cast-off
shoes.
With
these
I
journeyed
down
to
Streatham
and
saw
that
they
exactly
fitted
the
tracks."
"I
saw
an
ill-dressed
vagabond
in
the
lane
yesterday
evening,"
said
Mr.
Holder.
"Precisely.
It
was
I.
I
found
that
I
had
my
man,
so
I
came
home
and
changed
my
clothes.
It
was
a
delicate
part
which
I
had
to
play
then,
for
I
saw
that
a
prosecution
must
be
avoided
to
avert
scandal,
and
I
knew
that
so
astute
a
villain
would
see
that
our
hands
were
tied
in
the
matter.
I
went
and
saw
him.
At
first,
of
course,
he
denied
everything.
But
when
I
gave
him
every
particular
that
had
occurred,
he
tried
to
bluster
and
took
down
a
life-preserver
from
the
wall.
I
knew
my
man,
however,
and
I
clapped
a
pistol
to
his
head
before
he
could
strike.
Then
he
became
a
little
more
reasonable.
I
told
him
that
we
would
give
him
a
price
for
the
stones
he
held--1000
pounds
apiece.
That
brought
out
the
first
signs
of
grief
that
he
had
shown.
'Why,
dash
it
all!'
said
he,
'I've
let
them
go
at
six
hundred
for
the
three!'
I
soon
managed
to
get
the
address
of
the
receiver
who
had
them,
on
promising
him
that
there
would
be
no
prosecution.
Off
I
set
to
him,
and
after
much
chaffering
I
got
our
stones
at
1000
pounds
apiece.
Then
I
looked
in
upon
your
son,
told
him
that
all
was
right,
and
eventually
got
to
my
bed
about
two
o'clock,
after
what
I
may
call
a
really
hard
day's
work."
"A
day
which
has
saved
England
from
a
great
public
scandal,"
said
the
banker,
rising.
"Sir,
I
cannot
find
words
to
thank
you,
but
you
shall
not
find
me
ungrateful
for
what
you
have
done.
Your
skill
has
indeed
exceeded
all
that
I
have
heard
of
it.
And
now
I
must
fly
to
my
dear
boy
to
apologise
to
him
for
the
wrong
which
I
have
done
him.
As
to
what
you
tell
me
of
poor
Mary,
it
goes
to
my
very
heart.
Not
even
your
skill
can
inform
me
where
she
is
now."
"I
think
that
we
may
safely
say,"
returned
Holmes,
"that
she
is
wherever
Sir
George
Burnwell
is.
It
is
equally
certain,
too,
that
whatever
her
sins
are,
they
will
soon
receive
a
more
than
sufficient
punishment."
XII.
THE
ADVENTURE
OF
THE
COPPER
BEECHES
"To
the
man
who
loves
art
for
its
own
sake,"
remarked
Sherlock
Holmes,
tossing
aside
the
advertisement
sheet
of
the
Daily
Telegraph,
"it
is
frequently
in
its
least
important
and
lowliest
manifestations
that
the
keenest
pleasure
is
to
be
derived.
It
is
pleasant
to
me
to
observe,
Watson,
that
you
have
so
far
grasped
this
truth
that
in
these
little
records
of
our
cases
which
you
have
been
good
enough
to
draw
up,
and,
I
am
bound
to
say,
occasionally
to
embellish,
you
have
given
prominence
not
so
much
to
the
many
causes
célèbres
and
sensational
trials
in
which
I
have
figured
but
rather
to
those
incidents
which
may
have
been
trivial
in
themselves,
but
which
have
given
room
for
those
faculties
of
deduction
and
of
logical
synthesis
which
I
have
made
my
special
province."
"And
yet,"
said
I,
smiling,
"I
cannot
quite
hold
myself
absolved
from
the
charge
of
sensationalism
which
has
been
urged
against
my
records."
"You
have
erred,
perhaps,"
he
observed,
taking
up
a
glowing
cinder
with
the
tongs
and
lighting
with
it
the
long
cherry-wood
pipe
which
was
wont
to
replace
his
clay
when
he
was
in
a
disputatious
rather
than
a
meditative
mood--"you
have
erred
perhaps
in
attempting
to
put
colour
and
life
into
each
of
your
statements
instead
of
confining
yourself
to
the
task
of
placing
upon
record
that
severe
reasoning
from
cause
to
effect
which
is
really
the
only
notable
feature
about
the
thing."
"It
seems
to
me
that
I
have
done
you
full
justice
in
the
matter,"
I
remarked
with
some
coldness,
for
I
was
repelled
by
the
egotism
which
I
had
more
than
once
observed
to
be
a
strong
factor
in
my
friend's
singular
character.
"No,
it
is
not
selfishness
or
conceit,"
said
he,
answering,
as
was
his
wont,
my
thoughts
rather
than
my
words.
"If
I
claim
full
justice
for
my
art,
it
is
because
it
is
an
impersonal
thing--a
thing
beyond
myself.
Crime
is
common.
Logic
is
rare.
Therefore
it
is
upon
the
logic
rather
than
upon
the
crime
that
you
should
dwell.
You
have
degraded
what
should
have
been
a
course
of
lectures
into
a
series
of
tales."
It
was
a
cold
morning
of
the
early
spring,
and
we
sat
after
breakfast
on
either
side
of
a
cheery
fire
in
the
old
room
at
Baker
Street.
A
thick
fog
rolled
down
between
the
lines
of
dun-coloured
houses,
and
the
opposing
windows
loomed
like
dark,
shapeless
blurs
through
the
heavy
yellow
wreaths.
Our
gas
was
lit
and
shone
on
the
white
cloth
and
glimmer
of
china
and
metal,
for
the
table
had
not
been
cleared
yet.
Sherlock
Holmes
had
been
silent
all
the
morning,
dipping
continuously
into
the
advertisement
columns
of
a
succession
of
papers
until
at
last,
having
apparently
given
up
his
search,
he
had
emerged
in
no
very
sweet
temper
to
lecture
me
upon
my
literary
shortcomings.
"At
the
same
time,"
he
remarked
after
a
pause,
during
which
he
had
sat
puffing
at
his
long
pipe
and
gazing
down
into
the
fire,
"you
can
hardly
be
open
to
a
charge
of
sensationalism,
for
out
of
these
cases
which
you
have
been
so
kind
as
to
interest
yourself
in,
a
fair
proportion
do
not
treat
of
crime,
in
its
legal
sense,
at
all.
The
small
matter
in
which
I
endeavoured
to
help
the
King
of
Bohemia,
the
singular
experience
of
Miss
Mary
Sutherland,
the
problem
connected
with
the
man
with
the
twisted
lip,
and
the
incident
of
the
noble
bachelor,
were
all
matters
which
are
outside
the
pale
of
the
law.
But
in
avoiding
the
sensational,
I
fear
that
you
may
have
bordered
on
the
trivial."
"The
end
may
have
been
so,"
I
answered,
"but
the
methods
I
hold
to
have
been
novel
and
of
interest."
"Pshaw,
my
dear
fellow,
what
do
the
public,
the
great
unobservant
public,
who
could
hardly
tell
a
weaver
by
his
tooth
or
a
compositor
by
his
left
thumb,
care
about
the
finer
shades
of
analysis
and
deduction!
But,
indeed,
if
you
are
trivial,
I
cannot
blame
you,
for
the
days
of
the
great
cases
are
past.
Man,
or
at
least
criminal
man,
has
lost
all
enterprise
and
originality.
As
to
my
own
little
practice,
it
seems
to
be
degenerating
into
an
agency
for
recovering
lost
lead
pencils
and
giving
advice
to
young
ladies
from
boarding-schools.
I
think
that
I
have
touched
bottom
at
last,
however.
This
note
I
had
this
morning
marks
my
zero-point,
I
fancy.
Read
it!"
He
tossed
a
crumpled
letter
across
to
me.
It
was
dated
from
Montague
Place
upon
the
preceding
evening,
and
ran
thus:
"DEAR
MR.
HOLMES:--I
am
very
anxious
to
consult
you
as
to
whether
I
should
or
should
not
accept
a
situation
which
has
been
offered
to
me
as
governess.
I
shall
call
at
half-past
ten
to-morrow
if
I
do
not
inconvenience
you.
Yours
faithfully,
"VIOLET
HUNTER."
"Do
you
know
the
young
lady?"
I
asked.
"Not
I."
"It
is
half-past
ten
now."
"Yes,
and
I
have
no
doubt
that
is
her
ring."
"It
may
turn
out
to
be
of
more
interest
than
you
think.
You
remember
that
the
affair
of
the
blue
carbuncle,
which
appeared
to
be
a
mere
whim
at
first,
developed
into
a
serious
investigation.
It
may
be
so
in
this
case,
also."
"Well,
let
us
hope
so.
But
our
doubts
will
very
soon
be
solved,
for
here,
unless
I
am
much
mistaken,
is
the
person
in
question."
As
he
spoke
the
door
opened
and
a
young
lady
entered
the
room.
She
was
plainly
but
neatly
dressed,
with
a
bright,
quick
face,
freckled
like
a
plover's
egg,
and
with
the
brisk
manner
of
a
woman
who
has
had
her
own
way
to
make
in
the
world.
"You
will
excuse
my
troubling
you,
I
am
sure,"
said
she,
as
my
companion
rose
to
greet
her,
"but
I
have
had
a
very
strange
experience,
and
as
I
have
no
parents
or
relations
of
any
sort
from
whom
I
could
ask
advice,
I
thought
that
perhaps
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
what
I
should
do."
"Pray
take
a
seat,
Miss
Hunter.
I
shall
be
happy
to
do
anything
that
I
can
to
serve
you."
I
could
see
that
Holmes
was
favourably
impressed
by
the
manner
and
speech
of
his
new
client.
He
looked
her
over
in
his
searching
fashion,
and
then
composed
himself,
with
his
lids
drooping
and
his
finger-tips
together,
to
listen
to
her
story.
"I
have
been
a
governess
for
five
years,"
said
she,
"in
the
family
of
Colonel
Spence
Munro,
but
two
months
ago
the
colonel
received
an
appointment
at
Halifax,
in
Nova
Scotia,
and
took
his
children
over
to
America
with
him,
so
that
I
found
myself
without
a
situation.
I
advertised,
and
I
answered
advertisements,
but
without
success.
At
last
the
little
money
which
I
had
saved
began
to
run
short,
and
I
was
at
my
wit's
end
as
to
what
I
should
do.
"There
is
a
well-known
agency
for
governesses
in
the
West
End
called
Westaway's,
and
there
I
used
to
call
about
once
a
week
in
order
to
see
whether
anything
had
turned
up
which
might
suit
me.
Westaway
was
the
name
of
the
founder
of
the
business,
but
it
is
really
managed
by
Miss
Stoper.
She
sits
in
her
own
little
office,
and
the
ladies
who
are
seeking
employment
wait
in
an
anteroom,
and
are
then
shown
in
one
by
one,
when
she
consults
her
ledgers
and
sees
whether
she
has
anything
which
would
suit
them.
"Well,
when
I
called
last
week
I
was
shown
into
the
little
office
as
usual,
but
I
found
that
Miss
Stoper
was
not
alone.
A
prodigiously
stout
man
with
a
very
smiling
face
and
a
great
heavy
chin
which
rolled
down
in
fold
upon
fold
over
his
throat
sat
at
her
elbow
with
a
pair
of
glasses
on
his
nose,
looking
very
earnestly
at
the
ladies
who
entered.
As
I
came
in
he
gave
quite
a
jump
in
his
chair
and
turned
quickly
to
Miss
Stoper.
"'That
will
do,'
said
he;
'I
could
not
ask
for
anything
better.
Capital!
capital!'
He
seemed
quite
enthusiastic
and
rubbed
his
hands
together
in
the
most
genial
fashion.
He
was
such
a
comfortable-looking
man
that
it
was
quite
a
pleasure
to
look
at
him.
"'You
are
looking
for
a
situation,
miss?'
he
asked.
"'Yes,
sir.'
"'As
governess?'
"'Yes,
sir.'
"'And
what
salary
do
you
ask?'
"'I
had
4
pounds
a
month
in
my
last
place
with
Colonel
Spence
Munro.'
"'Oh,
tut,
tut!
sweating--rank
sweating!'
he
cried,
throwing
his
fat
hands
out
into
the
air
like
a
man
who
is
in
a
boiling
passion.
'How
could
anyone
offer
so
pitiful
a
sum
to
a
lady
with
such
attractions
and
accomplishments?'
"'My
accomplishments,
sir,
may
be
less
than
you
imagine,'
said
I.
'A
little
French,
a
little
German,
music,
and
drawing--'
"'Tut,
tut!'
he
cried.
'This
is
all
quite
beside
the
question.
The
point
is,
have
you
or
have
you
not
the
bearing
and
deportment
of
a
lady?
There
it
is
in
a
nutshell.
If
you
have
not,
you
are
not
fitted
for
the
rearing
of
a
child
who
may
some
day
play
a
considerable
part
in
the
history
of
the
country.
But
if
you
have
why,
then,
how
could
any
gentleman
ask
you
to
condescend
to
accept
anything
under
the
three
figures?
Your
salary
with
me,
madam,
would
commence
at
100
pounds
a
year.'
"You
may
imagine,
Mr.
Holmes,
that
to
me,
destitute
as
I
was,
such
an
offer
seemed
almost
too
good
to
be
true.
The
gentleman,
however,
seeing
perhaps
the
look
of
incredulity
upon
my
face,
opened
a
pocket-book
and
took
out
a
note.
"'It
is
also
my
custom,'
said
he,
smiling
in
the
most
pleasant
fashion
until
his
eyes
were
just
two
little
shining
slits
amid
the
white
creases
of
his
face,
'to
advance
to
my
young
ladies
half
their
salary
beforehand,
so
that
they
may
meet
any
little
expenses
of
their
journey
and
their
wardrobe.'
"It
seemed
to
me
that
I
had
never
met
so
fascinating
and
so
thoughtful
a
man.
As
I
was
already
in
debt
to
my
tradesmen,
the
advance
was
a
great
convenience,
and
yet
there
was
something
unnatural
about
the
whole
transaction
which
made
me
wish
to
know
a
little
more
before
I
quite
committed
myself.
"'May
I
ask
where
you
live,
sir?'
said
I.
"'Hampshire.
Charming
rural
place.
The
Copper
Beeches,
five
miles
on
the
far
side
of
Winchester.
It
is
the
most
lovely
country,
my
dear
young
lady,
and
the
dearest
old
country-house.'
"'And
my
duties,
sir?
I
should
be
glad
to
know
what
they
would
be.'
"'One
child--one
dear
little
romper
just
six
years
old.
Oh,
if
you
could
see
him
killing
cockroaches
with
a
slipper!
Smack!
smack!
smack!
Three
gone
before
you
could
wink!'
He
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
his
eyes
into
his
head
again.
"I
was
a
little
startled
at
the
nature
of
the
child's
amusement,
but
the
father's
laughter
made
me
think
that
perhaps
he
was
joking.
"'My
sole
duties,
then,'
I
asked,
'are
to
take
charge
of
a
single
child?'
"'No,
no,
not
the
sole,
not
the
sole,
my
dear
young
lady,'
he
cried.
'Your
duty
would
be,
as
I
am
sure
your
good
sense
would
suggest,
to
obey
any
little
commands
my
wife
might
give,
provided
always
that
they
were
such
commands
as
a
lady
might
with
propriety
obey.
You
see
no
difficulty,
heh?'
"'I
should
be
happy
to
make
myself
useful.'
"'Quite
so.
In
dress
now,
for
example.
We
are
faddy
people,
you
know--faddy
but
kind-hearted.
If
you
were
asked
to
wear
any
dress
which
we
might
give
you,
you
would
not
object
to
our
little
whim.
Heh?'
"'No,'
said
I,
considerably
astonished
at
his
words.
"'Or
to
sit
here,
or
sit
there,
that
would
not
be
offensive
to
you?'
"'Oh,
no.'
"'Or
to
cut
your
hair
quite
short
before
you
come
to
us?'
"I
could
hardly
believe
my
ears.
As
you
may
observe,
Mr.
Holmes,
my
hair
is
somewhat
luxuriant,
and
of
a
rather
peculiar
tint
of
chestnut.
It
has
been
considered
artistic.
I
could
not
dream
of
sacrificing
it
in
this
offhand
fashion.
"'I
am
afraid
that
that
is
quite
impossible,'
said
I.
He
had
been
watching
me
eagerly
out
of
his
small
eyes,
and
I
could
see
a
shadow
pass
over
his
face
as
I
spoke.
"'I
am
afraid
that
it
is
quite
essential,'
said
he.
'It
is
a
little
fancy
of
my
wife's,
and
ladies'
fancies,
you
know,
madam,
ladies'
fancies
must
be
consulted.
And
so
you
won't
cut
your
hair?'
"'No,
sir,
I
really
could
not,'
I
answered
firmly.
"'Ah,
very
well;
then
that
quite
settles
the
matter.
It
is
a
pity,
because
in
other
respects
you
would
really
have
done
very
nicely.
In
that
case,
Miss
Stoper,
I
had
best
inspect
a
few
more
of
your
young
ladies.'
"The
manageress
had
sat
all
this
while
busy
with
her
papers
without
a
word
to
either
of
us,
but
she
glanced
at
me
now
with
so
much
annoyance
upon
her
face
that
I
could
not
help
suspecting
that
she
had
lost
a
handsome
commission
through
my
refusal.
"'Do
you
desire
your
name
to
be
kept
upon
the
books?'
she
asked.
"'If
you
please,
Miss
Stoper.'
"'Well,
really,
it
seems
rather
useless,
since
you
refuse
the
most
excellent
offers
in
this
fashion,'
said
she
sharply.
'You
can
hardly
expect
us
to
exert
ourselves
to
find
another
such
opening
for
you.
Good-day
to
you,
Miss
Hunter.'
She
struck
a
gong
upon
the
table,
and
I
was
shown
out
by
the
page.
"Well,
Mr.
Holmes,
when
I
got
back
to
my
lodgings
and
found
little
enough
in
the
cupboard,
and
two
or
three
bills
upon
the
table,
I
began
to
ask
myself
whether
I
had
not
done
a
very
foolish
thing.
After
all,
if
these
people
had
strange
fads
and
expected
obedience
on
the
most
extraordinary
matters,
they
were
at
least
ready
to
pay
for
their
eccentricity.
Very
few
governesses
in
England
are
getting
100
pounds
a
year.
Besides,
what
use
was
my
hair
to
me?
Many
people
are
improved
by
wearing
it
short
and
perhaps
I
should
be
among
the
number.
Next
day
I
was
inclined
to
think
that
I
had
made
a
mistake,
and
by
the
day
after
I
was
sure
of
it.
I
had
almost
overcome
my
pride
so
far
as
to
go
back
to
the
agency
and
inquire
whether
the
place
was
still
open
when
I
received
this
letter
from
the
gentleman
himself.
I
have
it
here
and
I
will
read
it
to
you:
"'The
Copper
Beeches,
near
Winchester.
"'DEAR
MISS
HUNTER:--Miss
Stoper
has
very
kindly
given
me
your
address,
and
I
write
from
here
to
ask
you
whether
you
have
reconsidered
your
decision.
My
wife
is
very
anxious
that
you
should
come,
for
she
has
been
much
attracted
by
my
description
of
you.
We
are
willing
to
give
30
pounds
a
quarter,
or
120
pounds
a
year,
so
as
to
recompense
you
for
any
little
inconvenience
which
our
fads
may
cause
you.
They
are
not
very
exacting,
after
all.
My
wife
is
fond
of
a
particular
shade
of
electric
blue
and
would
like
you
to
wear
such
a
dress
indoors
in
the
morning.
You
need
not,
however,
go
to
the
expense
of
purchasing
one,
as
we
have
one
belonging
to
my
dear
daughter
Alice
(now
in
Philadelphia),
which
would,
I
should
think,
fit
you
very
well.
Then,
as
to
sitting
here
or
there,
or
amusing
yourself
in
any
manner
indicated,
that
need
cause
you
no
inconvenience.
As
regards
your
hair,
it
is
no
doubt
a
pity,
especially
as
I
could
not
help
remarking
its
beauty
during
our
short
interview,
but
I
am
afraid
that
I
must
remain
firm
upon
this
point,
and
I
only
hope
that
the
increased
salary
may
recompense
you
for
the
loss.
Your
duties,
as
far
as
the
child
is
concerned,
are
very
light.
Now
do
try
to
come,
and
I
shall
meet
you
with
the
dog-cart
at
Winchester.
Let
me
know
your
train.
Yours
faithfully,
JEPHRO
RUCASTLE.'
"That
is
the
letter
which
I
have
just
received,
Mr.
Holmes,
and
my
mind
is
made
up
that
I
will
accept
it.
I
thought,
however,
that
before
taking
the
final
step
I
should
like
to
submit
the
whole
matter
to
your
consideration."
"Well,
Miss
Hunter,
if
your
mind
is
made
up,
that
settles
the
question,"
said
Holmes,
smiling.
"But
you
would
not
advise
me
to
refuse?"
"I
confess
that
it
is
not
the
situation
which
I
should
like
to
see
a
sister
of
mine
apply
for."
"What
is
the
meaning
of
it
all,
Mr.
Holmes?"
"Ah,
I
have
no
data.
I
cannot
tell.
Perhaps
you
have
yourself
formed
some
opinion?"
"Well,
there
seems
to
me
to
be
only
one
possible
solution.
Mr.
Rucastle
seemed
to
be
a
very
kind,
good-natured
man.
Is
it
not
possible
that
his
wife
is
a
lunatic,
that
he
desires
to
keep
the
matter
quiet
for
fear
she
should
be
taken
to
an
asylum,
and
that
he
humours
her
fancies
in
every
way
in
order
to
prevent
an
outbreak?"
"That
is
a
possible
solution--in
fact,
as
matters
stand,
it
is
the
most
probable
one.
But
in
any
case
it
does
not
seem
to
be
a
nice
household
for
a
young
lady."
"But
the
money,
Mr.
Holmes,
the
money!"
"Well,
yes,
of
course
the
pay
is
good--too
good.
That
is
what
makes
me
uneasy.
Why
should
they
give
you
120
pounds
a
year,
when
they
could
have
their
pick
for
40
pounds?
There
must
be
some
strong
reason
behind."
"I
thought
that
if
I
told
you
the
circumstances
you
would
understand
afterwards
if
I
wanted
your
help.
I
should
feel
so
much
stronger
if
I
felt
that
you
were
at
the
back
of
me."
"Oh,
you
may
carry
that
feeling
away
with
you.
I
assure
you
that
your
little
problem
promises
to
be
the
most
interesting
which
has
come
my
way
for
some
months.
There
is
something
distinctly
novel
about
some
of
the
features.
If
you
should
find
yourself
in
doubt
or
in
danger--"
"Danger!
What
danger
do
you
foresee?"
Holmes
shook
his
head
gravely.
"It
would
cease
to
be
a
danger
if
we
could
define
it,"
said
he.
"But
at
any
time,
day
or
night,
a
telegram
would
bring
me
down
to
your
help."
"That
is
enough."
She
rose
briskly
from
her
chair
with
the
anxiety
all
swept
from
her
face.
"I
shall
go
down
to
Hampshire
quite
easy
in
my
mind
now.
I
shall
write
to
Mr.
Rucastle
at
once,
sacrifice
my
poor
hair
to-night,
and
start
for
Winchester
to-morrow."
With
a
few
grateful
words
to
Holmes
she
bade
us
both
good-night
and
bustled
off
upon
her
way.
"At
least,"
said
I
as
we
heard
her
quick,
firm
steps
descending
the
stairs,
"she
seems
to
be
a
young
lady
who
is
very
well
able
to
take
care
of
herself."
"And
she
would
need
to
be,"
said
Holmes
gravely.
"I
am
much
mistaken
if
we
do
not
hear
from
her
before
many
days
are
past."
It
was
not
very
long
before
my
friend's
prediction
was
fulfilled.
A
fortnight
went
by,
during
which
I
frequently
found
my
thoughts
turning
in
her
direction
and
wondering
what
strange
side-alley
of
human
experience
this
lonely
woman
had
strayed
into.
The
unusual
salary,
the
curious
conditions,
the
light
duties,
all
pointed
to
something
abnormal,
though
whether
a
fad
or
a
plot,
or
whether
the
man
were
a
philanthropist
or
a
villain,
it
was
quite
beyond
my
powers
to
determine.
As
to
Holmes,
I
observed
that
he
sat
frequently
for
half
an
hour
on
end,
with
knitted
brows
and
an
abstracted
air,
but
he
swept
the
matter
away
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
when
I
mentioned
it.
"Data!
data!
data!"
he
cried
impatiently.
"I
can't
make
bricks
without
clay."
And
yet
he
would
always
wind
up
by
muttering
that
no
sister
of
his
should
ever
have
accepted
such
a
situation.
The
telegram
which
we
eventually
received
came
late
one
night
just
as
I
was
thinking
of
turning
in
and
Holmes
was
settling
down
to
one
of
those
all-night
chemical
researches
which
he
frequently
indulged
in,
when
I
would
leave
him
stooping
over
a
retort
and
a
test-tube
at
night
and
find
him
in
the
same
position
when
I
came
down
to
breakfast
in
the
morning.
He
opened
the
yellow
envelope,
and
then,
glancing
at
the
message,
threw
it
across
to
me.
"Just
look
up
the
trains
in
Bradshaw,"
said
he,
and
turned
back
to
his
chemical
studies.
The
summons
was
a
brief
and
urgent
one.
"Please
be
at
the
Black
Swan
Hotel
at
Winchester
at
midday
to-morrow,"
it
said.
"Do
come!
I
am
at
my
wit's
end.
HUNTER."
"Will
you
come
with
me?"
asked
Holmes,
glancing
up.
"I
should
wish
to."
"Just
look
it
up,
then."
"There
is
a
train
at
half-past
nine,"
said
I,
glancing
over
my
Bradshaw.
"It
is
due
at
Winchester
at
11:30."
"That
will
do
very
nicely.
Then
perhaps
I
had
better
postpone
my
analysis
of
the
acetones,
as
we
may
need
to
be
at
our
best
in
the
morning."
By
eleven
o'clock
the
next
day
we
were
well
upon
our
way
to
the
old
English
capital.
Holmes
had
been
buried
in
the
morning
papers
all
the
way
down,
but
after
we
had
passed
the
Hampshire
border
he
threw
them
down
and
began
to
admire
the
scenery.
It
was
an
ideal
spring
day,
a
light
blue
sky,
flecked
with
little
fleecy
white
clouds
drifting
across
from
west
to
east.
The
sun
was
shining
very
brightly,
and
yet
there
was
an
exhilarating
nip
in
the
air,
which
set
an
edge
to
a
man's
energy.
All
over
the
countryside,
away
to
the
rolling
hills
around
Aldershot,
the
little
red
and
grey
roofs
of
the
farm-steadings
peeped
out
from
amid
the
light
green
of
the
new
foliage.
"Are
they
not
fresh
and
beautiful?"
I
cried
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
a
man
fresh
from
the
fogs
of
Baker
Street.
But
Holmes
shook
his
head
gravely.
"Do
you
know,
Watson,"
said
he,
"that
it
is
one
of
the
curses
of
a
mind
with
a
turn
like
mine
that
I
must
look
at
everything
with
reference
to
my
own
special
subject.
You
look
at
these
scattered
houses,
and
you
are
impressed
by
their
beauty.
I
look
at
them,
and
the
only
thought
which
comes
to
me
is
a
feeling
of
their
isolation
and
of
the
impunity
with
which
crime
may
be
committed
there."
"Good
heavens!"
I
cried.
"Who
would
associate
crime
with
these
dear
old
homesteads?"
"They
always
fill
me
with
a
certain
horror.
It
is
my
belief,
Watson,
founded
upon
my
experience,
that
the
lowest
and
vilest
alleys
in
London
do
not
present
a
more
dreadful
record
of
sin
than
does
the
smiling
and
beautiful
countryside."
"You
horrify
me!"
"But
the
reason
is
very
obvious.
The
pressure
of
public
opinion
can
do
in
the
town
what
the
law
cannot
accomplish.
There
is
no
lane
so
vile
that
the
scream
of
a
tortured
child,
or
the
thud
of
a
drunkard's
blow,
does
not
beget
sympathy
and
indignation
among
the
neighbours,
and
then
the
whole
machinery
of
justice
is
ever
so
close
that
a
word
of
complaint
can
set
it
going,
and
there
is
but
a
step
between
the
crime
and
the
dock.
But
look
at
these
lonely
houses,
each
in
its
own
fields,
filled
for
the
most
part
with
poor
ignorant
folk
who
know
little
of
the
law.
Think
of
the
deeds
of
hellish
cruelty,
the
hidden
wickedness
which
may
go
on,
year
in,
year
out,
in
such
places,
and
none
the
wiser.
Had
this
lady
who
appeals
to
us
for
help
gone
to
live
in
Winchester,
I
should
never
have
had
a
fear
for
her.
It
is
the
five
miles
of
country
which
makes
the
danger.
Still,
it
is
clear
that
she
is
not
personally
threatened."
"No.
If
she
can
come
to
Winchester
to
meet
us
she
can
get
away."
"Quite
so.
She
has
her
freedom."
"What
CAN
be
the
matter,
then?
Can
you
suggest
no
explanation?"
"I
have
devised
seven
separate
explanations,
each
of
which
would
cover
the
facts
as
far
as
we
know
them.
But
which
of
these
is
correct
can
only
be
determined
by
the
fresh
information
which
we
shall
no
doubt
find
waiting
for
us.
Well,
there
is
the
tower
of
the
cathedral,
and
we
shall
soon
learn
all
that
Miss
Hunter
has
to
tell."
The
Black
Swan
is
an
inn
of
repute
in
the
High
Street,
at
no
distance
from
the
station,
and
there
we
found
the
young
lady
waiting
for
us.
She
had
engaged
a
sitting-room,
and
our
lunch
awaited
us
upon
the
table.
"I
am
so
delighted
that
you
have
come,"
she
said
earnestly.
"It
is
so
very
kind
of
you
both;
but
indeed
I
do
not
know
what
I
should
do.
Your
advice
will
be
altogether
invaluable
to
me."
"Pray
tell
us
what
has
happened
to
you."
"I
will
do
so,
and
I
must
be
quick,
for
I
have
promised
Mr.
Rucastle
to
be
back
before
three.
I
got
his
leave
to
come
into
town
this
morning,
though
he
little
knew
for
what
purpose."
"Let
us
have
everything
in
its
due
order."
Holmes
thrust
his
long
thin
legs
out
towards
the
fire
and
composed
himself
to
listen.
"In
the
first
place,
I
may
say
that
I
have
met,
on
the
whole,
with
no
actual
ill-treatment
from
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Rucastle.
It
is
only
fair
to
them
to
say
that.
But
I
cannot
understand
them,
and
I
am
not
easy
in
my
mind
about
them."
"What
can
you
not
understand?"
"Their
reasons
for
their
conduct.
But
you
shall
have
it
all
just
as
it
occurred.
When
I
came
down,
Mr.
Rucastle
met
me
here
and
drove
me
in
his
dog-cart
to
the
Copper
Beeches.
It
is,
as
he
said,
beautifully
situated,
but
it
is
not
beautiful
in
itself,
for
it
is
a
large
square
block
of
a
house,
whitewashed,
but
all
stained
and
streaked
with
damp
and
bad
weather.
There
are
grounds
round
it,
woods
on
three
sides,
and
on
the
fourth
a
field
which
slopes
down
to
the
Southampton
highroad,
which
curves
past
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
front
door.
This
ground
in
front
belongs
to
the
house,
but
the
woods
all
round
are
part
of
Lord
Southerton's
preserves.
A
clump
of
copper
beeches
immediately
in
front
of
the
hall
door
has
given
its
name
to
the
place.
"I
was
driven
over
by
my
employer,
who
was
as
amiable
as
ever,
and
was
introduced
by
him
that
evening
to
his
wife
and
the
child.
There
was
no
truth,
Mr.
Holmes,
in
the
conjecture
which
seemed
to
us
to
be
probable
in
your
rooms
at
Baker
Street.
Mrs.
Rucastle
is
not
mad.
I
found
her
to
be
a
silent,
pale-faced
woman,
much
younger
than
her
husband,
not
more
than
thirty,
I
should
think,
while
he
can
hardly
be
less
than
forty-five.
From
their
conversation
I
have
gathered
that
they
have
been
married
about
seven
years,
that
he
was
a
widower,
and
that
his
only
child
by
the
first
wife
was
the
daughter
who
has
gone
to
Philadelphia.
Mr.
Rucastle
told
me
in
private
that
the
reason
why
she
had
left
them
was
that
she
had
an
unreasoning
aversion
to
her
stepmother.
As
the
daughter
could
not
have
been
less
than
twenty,
I
can
quite
imagine
that
her
position
must
have
been
uncomfortable
with
her
father's
young
wife.
"Mrs.
Rucastle
seemed
to
me
to
be
colourless
in
mind
as
well
as
in
feature.
She
impressed
me
neither
favourably
nor
the
reverse.
She
was
a
nonentity.
It
was
easy
to
see
that
she
was
passionately
devoted
both
to
her
husband
and
to
her
little
son.
Her
light
grey
eyes
wandered
continually
from
one
to
the
other,
noting
every
little
want
and
forestalling
it
if
possible.
He
was
kind
to
her
also
in
his
bluff,
boisterous
fashion,
and
on
the
whole
they
seemed
to
be
a
happy
couple.
And
yet
she
had
some
secret
sorrow,
this
woman.
She
would
often
be
lost
in
deep
thought,
with
the
saddest
look
upon
her
face.
More
than
once
I
have
surprised
her
in
tears.
I
have
thought
sometimes
that
it
was
the
disposition
of
her
child
which
weighed
upon
her
mind,
for
I
have
never
met
so
utterly
spoiled
and
so
ill-natured
a
little
creature.
He
is
small
for
his
age,
with
a
head
which
is
quite
disproportionately
large.
His
whole
life
appears
to
be
spent
in
an
alternation
between
savage
fits
of
passion
and
gloomy
intervals
of
sulking.
Giving
pain
to
any
creature
weaker
than
himself
seems
to
be
his
one
idea
of
amusement,
and
he
shows
quite
remarkable
talent
in
planning
the
capture
of
mice,
little
birds,
and
insects.
But
I
would
rather
not
talk
about
the
creature,
Mr.
Holmes,
and,
indeed,
he
has
little
to
do
with
my
story."
"I
am
glad
of
all
details,"
remarked
my
friend,
"whether
they
seem
to
you
to
be
relevant
or
not."
"I
shall
try
not
to
miss
anything
of
importance.
The
one
unpleasant
thing
about
the
house,
which
struck
me
at
once,
was
the
appearance
and
conduct
of
the
servants.
There
are
only
two,
a
man
and
his
wife.
Toller,
for
that
is
his
name,
is
a
rough,
uncouth
man,
with
grizzled
hair
and
whiskers,
and
a
perpetual
smell
of
drink.
Twice
since
I
have
been
with
them
he
has
been
quite
drunk,
and
yet
Mr.
Rucastle
seemed
to
take
no
notice
of
it.
His
wife
is
a
very
tall
and
strong
woman
with
a
sour
face,
as
silent
as
Mrs.
Rucastle
and
much
less
amiable.
They
are
a
most
unpleasant
couple,
but
fortunately
I
spend
most
of
my
time
in
the
nursery
and
my
own
room,
which
are
next
to
each
other
in
one
corner
of
the
building.
"For
two
days
after
my
arrival
at
the
Copper
Beeches
my
life
was
very
quiet;
on
the
third,
Mrs.
Rucastle
came
down
just
after
breakfast
and
whispered
something
to
her
husband.
"'Oh,
yes,'
said
he,
turning
to
me,
'we
are
very
much
obliged
to
you,
Miss
Hunter,
for
falling
in
with
our
whims
so
far
as
to
cut
your
hair.
I
assure
you
that
it
has
not
detracted
in
the
tiniest
iota
from
your
appearance.
We
shall
now
see
how
the
electric-blue
dress
will
become
you.
You
will
find
it
laid
out
upon
the
bed
in
your
room,
and
if
you
would
be
so
good
as
to
put
it
on
we
should
both
be
extremely
obliged.'
"The
dress
which
I
found
waiting
for
me
was
of
a
peculiar
shade
of
blue.
It
was
of
excellent
material,
a
sort
of
beige,
but
it
bore
unmistakable
signs
of
having
been
worn
before.
It
could
not
have
been
a
better
fit
if
I
had
been
measured
for
it.
Both
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Rucastle
expressed
a
delight
at
the
look
of
it,
which
seemed
quite
exaggerated
in
its
vehemence.
They
were
waiting
for
me
in
the
drawing-room,
which
is
a
very
large
room,
stretching
along
the
entire
front
of
the
house,
with
three
long
windows
reaching
down
to
the
floor.
A
chair
had
been
placed
close
to
the
central
window,
with
its
back
turned
towards
it.
In
this
I
was
asked
to
sit,
and
then
Mr.
Rucastle,
walking
up
and
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
room,
began
to
tell
me
a
series
of
the
funniest
stories
that
I
have
ever
listened
to.
You
cannot
imagine
how
comical
he
was,
and
I
laughed
until
I
was
quite
weary.
Mrs.
Rucastle,
however,
who
has
evidently
no
sense
of
humour,
never
so
much
as
smiled,
but
sat
with
her
hands
in
her
lap,
and
a
sad,
anxious
look
upon
her
face.
After
an
hour
or
so,
Mr.
Rucastle
suddenly
remarked
that
it
was
time
to
commence
the
duties
of
the
day,
and
that
I
might
change
my
dress
and
go
to
little
Edward
in
the
nursery.
"Two
days
later
this
same
performance
was
gone
through
under
exactly
similar
circumstances.
Again
I
changed
my
dress,
again
I
sat
in
the
window,
and
again
I
laughed
very
heartily
at
the
funny
stories
of
which
my
employer
had
an
immense
répertoire,
and
which
he
told
inimitably.
Then
he
handed
me
a
yellow-backed
novel,
and
moving
my
chair
a
little
sideways,
that
my
own
shadow
might
not
fall
upon
the
page,
he
begged
me
to
read
aloud
to
him.
I
read
for
about
ten
minutes,
beginning
in
the
heart
of
a
chapter,
and
then
suddenly,
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence,
he
ordered
me
to
cease
and
to
change
my
dress.
"You
can
easily
imagine,
Mr.
Holmes,
how
curious
I
became
as
to
what
the
meaning
of
this
extraordinary
performance
could
possibly
be.
They
were
always
very
careful,
I
observed,
to
turn
my
face
away
from
the
window,
so
that
I
became
consumed
with
the
desire
to
see
what
was
going
on
behind
my
back.
At
first
it
seemed
to
be
impossible,
but
I
soon
devised
a
means.
My
hand-mirror
had
been
broken,
so
a
happy
thought
seized
me,
and
I
concealed
a
piece
of
the
glass
in
my
handkerchief.
On
the
next
occasion,
in
the
midst
of
my
laughter,
I
put
my
handkerchief
up
to
my
eyes,
and
was
able
with
a
little
management
to
see
all
that
there
was
behind
me.
I
confess
that
I
was
disappointed.
There
was
nothing.
At
least
that
was
my
first
impression.
At
the
second
glance,
however,
I
perceived
that
there
was
a
man
standing
in
the
Southampton
Road,
a
small
bearded
man
in
a
grey
suit,
who
seemed
to
be
looking
in
my
direction.
The
road
is
an
important
highway,
and
there
are
usually
people
there.
This
man,
however,
was
leaning
against
the
railings
which
bordered
our
field
and
was
looking
earnestly
up.
I
lowered
my
handkerchief
and
glanced
at
Mrs.
Rucastle
to
find
her
eyes
fixed
upon
me
with
a
most
searching
gaze.
She
said
nothing,
but
I
am
convinced
that
she
had
divined
that
I
had
a
mirror
in
my
hand
and
had
seen
what
was
behind
me.
She
rose
at
once.
"'Jephro,'
said
she,
'there
is
an
impertinent
fellow
upon
the
road
there
who
stares
up
at
Miss
Hunter.'
"'No
friend
of
yours,
Miss
Hunter?'
he
asked.
"'No,
I
know
no
one
in
these
parts.'
"'Dear
me!
How
very
impertinent!
Kindly
turn
round
and
motion
to
him
to
go
away.'
"'Surely
it
would
be
better
to
take
no
notice.'
"'No,
no,
we
should
have
him
loitering
here
always.
Kindly
turn
round
and
wave
him
away
like
that.'
"I
did
as
I
was
told,
and
at
the
same
instant
Mrs.
Rucastle
drew
down
the
blind.
That
was
a
week
ago,
and
from
that
time
I
have
not
sat
again
in
the
window,
nor
have
I
worn
the
blue
dress,
nor
seen
the
man
in
the
road."
"Pray
continue,"
said
Holmes.
"Your
narrative
promises
to
be
a
most
interesting
one."
"You
will
find
it
rather
disconnected,
I
fear,
and
there
may
prove
to
be
little
relation
between
the
different
incidents
of
which
I
speak.
On
the
very
first
day
that
I
was
at
the
Copper
Beeches,
Mr.
Rucastle
took
me
to
a
small
outhouse
which
stands
near
the
kitchen
door.
As
we
approached
it
I
heard
the
sharp
rattling
of
a
chain,
and
the
sound
as
of
a
large
animal
moving
about.
"'Look
in
here!'
said
Mr.
Rucastle,
showing
me
a
slit
between
two
planks.
'Is
he
not
a
beauty?'
"I
looked
through
and
was
conscious
of
two
glowing
eyes,
and
of
a
vague
figure
huddled
up
in
the
darkness.
"'Don't
be
frightened,'
said
my
employer,
laughing
at
the
start
which
I
had
given.
'It's
only
Carlo,
my
mastiff.
I
call
him
mine,
but
really
old
Toller,
my
groom,
is
the
only
man
who
can
do
anything
with
him.
We
feed
him
once
a
day,
and
not
too
much
then,
so
that
he
is
always
as
keen
as
mustard.
Toller
lets
him
loose
every
night,
and
God
help
the
trespasser
whom
he
lays
his
fangs
upon.
For
goodness'
sake
don't
you
ever
on
any
pretext
set
your
foot
over
the
threshold
at
night,
for
it's
as
much
as
your
life
is
worth.'
"The
warning
was
no
idle
one,
for
two
nights
later
I
happened
to
look
out
of
my
bedroom
window
about
two
o'clock
in
the
morning.
It
was
a
beautiful
moonlight
night,
and
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
house
was
silvered
over
and
almost
as
bright
as
day.
I
was
standing,
rapt
in
the
peaceful
beauty
of
the
scene,
when
I
was
aware
that
something
was
moving
under
the
shadow
of
the
copper
beeches.
As
it
emerged
into
the
moonshine
I
saw
what
it
was.
It
was
a
giant
dog,
as
large
as
a
calf,
tawny
tinted,
with
hanging
jowl,
black
muzzle,
and
huge
projecting
bones.
It
walked
slowly
across
the
lawn
and
vanished
into
the
shadow
upon
the
other
side.
That
dreadful
sentinel
sent
a
chill
to
my
heart
which
I
do
not
think
that
any
burglar
could
have
done.
"And
now
I
have
a
very
strange
experience
to
tell
you.
I
had,
as
you
know,
cut
off
my
hair
in
London,
and
I
had
placed
it
in
a
great
coil
at
the
bottom
of
my
trunk.
One
evening,
after
the
child
was
in
bed,
I
began
to
amuse
myself
by
examining
the
furniture
of
my
room
and
by
rearranging
my
own
little
things.
There
was
an
old
chest
of
drawers
in
the
room,
the
two
upper
ones
empty
and
open,
the
lower
one
locked.
I
had
filled
the
first
two
with
my
linen,
and
as
I
had
still
much
to
pack
away
I
was
naturally
annoyed
at
not
having
the
use
of
the
third
drawer.
It
struck
me
that
it
might
have
been
fastened
by
a
mere
oversight,
so
I
took
out
my
bunch
of
keys
and
tried
to
open
it.
The
very
first
key
fitted
to
perfection,
and
I
drew
the
drawer
open.
There
was
only
one
thing
in
it,
but
I
am
sure
that
you
would
never
guess
what
it
was.
It
was
my
coil
of
hair.
"I
took
it
up
and
examined
it.
It
was
of
the
same
peculiar
tint,
and
the
same
thickness.
But
then
the
impossibility
of
the
thing
obtruded
itself
upon
me.
How
could
my
hair
have
been
locked
in
the
drawer?
With
trembling
hands
I
undid
my
trunk,
turned
out
the
contents,
and
drew
from
the
bottom
my
own
hair.
I
laid
the
two
tresses
together,
and
I
assure
you
that
they
were
identical.
Was
it
not
extraordinary?
Puzzle
as
I
would,
I
could
make
nothing
at
all
of
what
it
meant.
I
returned
the
strange
hair
to
the
drawer,
and
I
said
nothing
of
the
matter
to
the
Rucastles
as
I
felt
that
I
had
put
myself
in
the
wrong
by
opening
a
drawer
which
they
had
locked.
"I
am
naturally
observant,
as
you
may
have
remarked,
Mr.
Holmes,
and
I
soon
had
a
pretty
good
plan
of
the
whole
house
in
my
head.
There
was
one
wing,
however,
which
appeared
not
to
be
inhabited
at
all.
A
door
which
faced
that
which
led
into
the
quarters
of
the
Tollers
opened
into
this
suite,
but
it
was
invariably
locked.
One
day,
however,
as
I
ascended
the
stair,
I
met
Mr.
Rucastle
coming
out
through
this
door,
his
keys
in
his
hand,
and
a
look
on
his
face
which
made
him
a
very
different
person
to
the
round,
jovial
man
to
whom
I
was
accustomed.
His
cheeks
were
red,
his
brow
was
all
crinkled
with
anger,
and
the
veins
stood
out
at
his
temples
with
passion.
He
locked
the
door
and
hurried
past
me
without
a
word
or
a
look.
"This
aroused
my
curiosity,
so
when
I
went
out
for
a
walk
in
the
grounds
with
my
charge,
I
strolled
round
to
the
side
from
which
I
could
see
the
windows
of
this
part
of
the
house.
There
were
four
of
them
in
a
row,
three
of
which
were
simply
dirty,
while
the
fourth
was
shuttered
up.
They
were
evidently
all
deserted.
As
I
strolled
up
and
down,
glancing
at
them
occasionally,
Mr.
Rucastle
came
out
to
me,
looking
as
merry
and
jovial
as
ever.
"'Ah!'
said
he,
'you
must
not
think
me
rude
if
I
passed
you
without
a
word,
my
dear
young
lady.
I
was
preoccupied
with
business
matters.'
"I
assured
him
that
I
was
not
offended.
'By
the
way,'
said
I,
'you
seem
to
have
quite
a
suite
of
spare
rooms
up
there,
and
one
of
them
has
the
shutters
up.'
"He
looked
surprised
and,
as
it
seemed
to
me,
a
little
startled
at
my
remark.
"'Photography
is
one
of
my
hobbies,'
said
he.
'I
have
made
my
dark
room
up
there.
But,
dear
me!
what
an
observant
young
lady
we
have
come
upon.
Who
would
have
believed
it?
Who
would
have
ever
believed
it?'
He
spoke
in
a
jesting
tone,
but
there
was
no
jest
in
his
eyes
as
he
looked
at
me.
I
read
suspicion
there
and
annoyance,
but
no
jest.
"Well,
Mr.
Holmes,
from
the
moment
that
I
understood
that
there
was
something
about
that
suite
of
rooms
which
I
was
not
to
know,
I
was
all
on
fire
to
go
over
them.
It
was
not
mere
curiosity,
though
I
have
my
share
of
that.
It
was
more
a
feeling
of
duty--a
feeling
that
some
good
might
come
from
my
penetrating
to
this
place.
They
talk
of
woman's
instinct;
perhaps
it
was
woman's
instinct
which
gave
me
that
feeling.
At
any
rate,
it
was
there,
and
I
was
keenly
on
the
lookout
for
any
chance
to
pass
the
forbidden
door.
"It
was
only
yesterday
that
the
chance
came.
I
may
tell
you
that,
besides
Mr.
Rucastle,
both
Toller
and
his
wife
find
something
to
do
in
these
deserted
rooms,
and
I
once
saw
him
carrying
a
large
black
linen
bag
with
him
through
the
door.
Recently
he
has
been
drinking
hard,
and
yesterday
evening
he
was
very
drunk;
and
when
I
came
upstairs
there
was
the
key
in
the
door.
I
have
no
doubt
at
all
that
he
had
left
it
there.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Rucastle
were
both
downstairs,
and
the
child
was
with
them,
so
that
I
had
an
admirable
opportunity.
I
turned
the
key
gently
in
the
lock,
opened
the
door,
and
slipped
through.
"There
was
a
little
passage
in
front
of
me,
unpapered
and
uncarpeted,
which
turned
at
a
right
angle
at
the
farther
end.
Round
this
corner
were
three
doors
in
a
line,
the
first
and
third
of
which
were
open.
They
each
led
into
an
empty
room,
dusty
and
cheerless,
with
two
windows
in
the
one
and
one
in
the
other,
so
thick
with
dirt
that
the
evening
light
glimmered
dimly
through
them.
The
centre
door
was
closed,
and
across
the
outside
of
it
had
been
fastened
one
of
the
broad
bars
of
an
iron
bed,
padlocked
at
one
end
to
a
ring
in
the
wall,
and
fastened
at
the
other
with
stout
cord.
The
door
itself
was
locked
as
well,
and
the
key
was
not
there.
This
barricaded
door
corresponded
clearly
with
the
shuttered
window
outside,
and
yet
I
could
see
by
the
glimmer
from
beneath
it
that
the
room
was
not
in
darkness.
Evidently
there
was
a
skylight
which
let
in
light
from
above.
As
I
stood
in
the
passage
gazing
at
the
sinister
door
and
wondering
what
secret
it
might
veil,
I
suddenly
heard
the
sound
of
steps
within
the
room
and
saw
a
shadow
pass
backward
and
forward
against
the
little
slit
of
dim
light
which
shone
out
from
under
the
door.
A
mad,
unreasoning
terror
rose
up
in
me
at
the
sight,
Mr.
Holmes.
My
overstrung
nerves
failed
me
suddenly,
and
I
turned
and
ran--ran
as
though
some
dreadful
hand
were
behind
me
clutching
at
the
skirt
of
my
dress.
I
rushed
down
the
passage,
through
the
door,
and
straight
into
the
arms
of
Mr.
Rucastle,
who
was
waiting
outside.
"'So,'
said
he,
smiling,
'it
was
you,
then.
I
thought
that
it
must
be
when
I
saw
the
door
open.'
"'Oh,
I
am
so
frightened!'
I
panted.
"'My
dear
young
lady!
my
dear
young
lady!'--you
cannot
think
how
caressing
and
soothing
his
manner
was--'and
what
has
frightened
you,
my
dear
young
lady?'
"But
his
voice
was
just
a
little
too
coaxing.
He
overdid
it.
I
was
keenly
on
my
guard
against
him.
"'I
was
foolish
enough
to
go
into
the
empty
wing,'
I
answered.
'But
it
is
so
lonely
and
eerie
in
this
dim
light
that
I
was
frightened
and
ran
out
again.
Oh,
it
is
so
dreadfully
still
in
there!'
"'Only
that?'
said
he,
looking
at
me
keenly.
"'Why,
what
did
you
think?'
I
asked.
"'Why
do
you
think
that
I
lock
this
door?'
"'I
am
sure
that
I
do
not
know.'
"'It
is
to
keep
people
out
who
have
no
business
there.
Do
you
see?'
He
was
still
smiling
in
the
most
amiable
manner.
"'I
am
sure
if
I
had
known--'
"'Well,
then,
you
know
now.
And
if
you
ever
put
your
foot
over
that
threshold
again'--here
in
an
instant
the
smile
hardened
into
a
grin
of
rage,
and
he
glared
down
at
me
with
the
face
of
a
demon--'I'll
throw
you
to
the
mastiff.'
"I
was
so
terrified
that
I
do
not
know
what
I
did.
I
suppose
that
I
must
have
rushed
past
him
into
my
room.
I
remember
nothing
until
I
found
myself
lying
on
my
bed
trembling
all
over.
Then
I
thought
of
you,
Mr.
Holmes.
I
could
not
live
there
longer
without
some
advice.
I
was
frightened
of
the
house,
of
the
man,
of
the
woman,
of
the
servants,
even
of
the
child.
They
were
all
horrible
to
me.
If
I
could
only
bring
you
down
all
would
be
well.
Of
course
I
might
have
fled
from
the
house,
but
my
curiosity
was
almost
as
strong
as
my
fears.
My
mind
was
soon
made
up.
I
would
send
you
a
wire.
I
put
on
my
hat
and
cloak,
went
down
to
the
office,
which
is
about
half
a
mile
from
the
house,
and
then
returned,
feeling
very
much
easier.
A
horrible
doubt
came
into
my
mind
as
I
approached
the
door
lest
the
dog
might
be
loose,
but
I
remembered
that
Toller
had
drunk
himself
into
a
state
of
insensibility
that
evening,
and
I
knew
that
he
was
the
only
one
in
the
household
who
had
any
influence
with
the
savage
creature,
or
who
would
venture
to
set
him
free.
I
slipped
in
in
safety
and
lay
awake
half
the
night
in
my
joy
at
the
thought
of
seeing
you.
I
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
leave
to
come
into
Winchester
this
morning,
but
I
must
be
back
before
three
o'clock,
for
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Rucastle
are
going
on
a
visit,
and
will
be
away
all
the
evening,
so
that
I
must
look
after
the
child.
Now
I
have
told
you
all
my
adventures,
Mr.
Holmes,
and
I
should
be
very
glad
if
you
could
tell
me
what
it
all
means,
and,
above
all,
what
I
should
do."
Holmes
and
I
had
listened
spellbound
to
this
extraordinary
story.
My
friend
rose
now
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room,
his
hands
in
his
pockets,
and
an
expression
of
the
most
profound
gravity
upon
his
face.
"Is
Toller
still
drunk?"
he
asked.
"Yes.
I
heard
his
wife
tell
Mrs.
Rucastle
that
she
could
do
nothing
with
him."
"That
is
well.
And
the
Rucastles
go
out
to-night?"
"Yes."
"Is
there
a
cellar
with
a
good
strong
lock?"
"Yes,
the
wine-cellar."
"You
seem
to
me
to
have
acted
all
through
this
matter
like
a
very
brave
and
sensible
girl,
Miss
Hunter.
Do
you
think
that
you
could
perform
one
more
feat?
I
should
not
ask
it
of
you
if
I
did
not
think
you
a
quite
exceptional
woman."
"I
will
try.
What
is
it?"
"We
shall
be
at
the
Copper
Beeches
by
seven
o'clock,
my
friend
and
I.
The
Rucastles
will
be
gone
by
that
time,
and
Toller
will,
we
hope,
be
incapable.
There
only
remains
Mrs.
Toller,
who
might
give
the
alarm.
If
you
could
send
her
into
the
cellar
on
some
errand,
and
then
turn
the
key
upon
her,
you
would
facilitate
matters
immensely."
"I
will
do
it."
"Excellent!
We
shall
then
look
thoroughly
into
the
affair.
Of
course
there
is
only
one
feasible
explanation.
You
have
been
brought
there
to
personate
someone,
and
the
real
person
is
imprisoned
in
this
chamber.
That
is
obvious.
As
to
who
this
prisoner
is,
I
have
no
doubt
that
it
is
the
daughter,
Miss
Alice
Rucastle,
if
I
remember
right,
who
was
said
to
have
gone
to
America.
You
were
chosen,
doubtless,
as
resembling
her
in
height,
figure,
and
the
colour
of
your
hair.
Hers
had
been
cut
off,
very
possibly
in
some
illness
through
which
she
has
passed,
and
so,
of
course,
yours
had
to
be
sacrificed
also.
By
a
curious
chance
you
came
upon
her
tresses.
The
man
in
the
road
was
undoubtedly
some
friend
of
hers--possibly
her
fiancé--and
no
doubt,
as
you
wore
the
girl's
dress
and
were
so
like
her,
he
was
convinced
from
your
laughter,
whenever
he
saw
you,
and
afterwards
from
your
gesture,
that
Miss
Rucastle
was
perfectly
happy,
and
that
she
no
longer
desired
his
attentions.
The
dog
is
let
loose
at
night
to
prevent
him
from
endeavouring
to
communicate
with
her.
So
much
is
fairly
clear.
The
most
serious
point
in
the
case
is
the
disposition
of
the
child."
"What
on
earth
has
that
to
do
with
it?"
I
ejaculated.
"My
dear
Watson,
you
as
a
medical
man
are
continually
gaining
light
as
to
the
tendencies
of
a
child
by
the
study
of
the
parents.
Don't
you
see
that
the
converse
is
equally
valid.
I
have
frequently
gained
my
first
real
insight
into
the
character
of
parents
by
studying
their
children.
This
child's
disposition
is
abnormally
cruel,
merely
for
cruelty's
sake,
and
whether
he
derives
this
from
his
smiling
father,
as
I
should
suspect,
or
from
his
mother,
it
bodes
evil
for
the
poor
girl
who
is
in
their
power."
"I
am
sure
that
you
are
right,
Mr.
Holmes,"
cried
our
client.
"A
thousand
things
come
back
to
me
which
make
me
certain
that
you
have
hit
it.
Oh,
let
us
lose
not
an
instant
in
bringing
help
to
this
poor
creature."
"We
must
be
circumspect,
for
we
are
dealing
with
a
very
cunning
man.
We
can
do
nothing
until
seven
o'clock.
At
that
hour
we
shall
be
with
you,
and
it
will
not
be
long
before
we
solve
the
mystery."
We
were
as
good
as
our
word,
for
it
was
just
seven
when
we
reached
the
Copper
Beeches,
having
put
up
our
trap
at
a
wayside
public-house.
The
group
of
trees,
with
their
dark
leaves
shining
like
burnished
metal
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun,
were
sufficient
to
mark
the
house
even
had
Miss
Hunter
not
been
standing
smiling
on
the
door-step.
"Have
you
managed
it?"
asked
Holmes.
A
loud
thudding
noise
came
from
somewhere
downstairs.
"That
is
Mrs.
Toller
in
the
cellar,"
said
she.
"Her
husband
lies
snoring
on
the
kitchen
rug.
Here
are
his
keys,
which
are
the
duplicates
of
Mr.
Rucastle's."
"You
have
done
well
indeed!"
cried
Holmes
with
enthusiasm.
"Now
lead
the
way,
and
we
shall
soon
see
the
end
of
this
black
business."
We
passed
up
the
stair,
unlocked
the
door,
followed
on
down
a
passage,
and
found
ourselves
in
front
of
the
barricade
which
Miss
Hunter
had
described.
Holmes
cut
the
cord
and
removed
the
transverse
bar.
Then
he
tried
the
various
keys
in
the
lock,
but
without
success.
No
sound
came
from
within,
and
at
the
silence
Holmes'
face
clouded
over.
"I
trust
that
we
are
not
too
late,"
said
he.
"I
think,
Miss
Hunter,
that
we
had
better
go
in
without
you.
Now,
Watson,
put
your
shoulder
to
it,
and
we
shall
see
whether
we
cannot
make
our
way
in."
It
was
an
old
rickety
door
and
gave
at
once
before
our
united
strength.
Together
we
rushed
into
the
room.
It
was
empty.
There
was
no
furniture
save
a
little
pallet
bed,
a
small
table,
and
a
basketful
of
linen.
The
skylight
above
was
open,
and
the
prisoner
gone.
"There
has
been
some
villainy
here,"
said
Holmes;
"this
beauty
has
guessed
Miss
Hunter's
intentions
and
has
carried
his
victim
off."
"But
how?"
"Through
the
skylight.
We
shall
soon
see
how
he
managed
it."
He
swung
himself
up
onto
the
roof.
"Ah,
yes,"
he
cried,
"here's
the
end
of
a
long
light
ladder
against
the
eaves.
That
is
how
he
did
it."
"But
it
is
impossible,"
said
Miss
Hunter;
"the
ladder
was
not
there
when
the
Rucastles
went
away."
"He
has
come
back
and
done
it.
I
tell
you
that
he
is
a
clever
and
dangerous
man.
I
should
not
be
very
much
surprised
if
this
were
he
whose
step
I
hear
now
upon
the
stair.
I
think,
Watson,
that
it
would
be
as
well
for
you
to
have
your
pistol
ready."
The
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
before
a
man
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
room,
a
very
fat
and
burly
man,
with
a
heavy
stick
in
his
hand.
Miss
Hunter
screamed
and
shrunk
against
the
wall
at
the
sight
of
him,
but
Sherlock
Holmes
sprang
forward
and
confronted
him.
"You
villain!"
said
he,
"where's
your
daughter?"
The
fat
man
cast
his
eyes
round,
and
then
up
at
the
open
skylight.
"It
is
for
me
to
ask
you
that,"
he
shrieked,
"you
thieves!
Spies
and
thieves!
I
have
caught
you,
have
I?
You
are
in
my
power.
I'll
serve
you!"
He
turned
and
clattered
down
the
stairs
as
hard
as
he
could
go.
"He's
gone
for
the
dog!"
cried
Miss
Hunter.
"I
have
my
revolver,"
said
I.
"Better
close
the
front
door,"
cried
Holmes,
and
we
all
rushed
down
the
stairs
together.
We
had
hardly
reached
the
hall
when
we
heard
the
baying
of
a
hound,
and
then
a
scream
of
agony,
with
a
horrible
worrying
sound
which
it
was
dreadful
to
listen
to.
An
elderly
man
with
a
red
face
and
shaking
limbs
came
staggering
out
at
a
side
door.
"My
God!"
he
cried.
"Someone
has
loosed
the
dog.
It's
not
been
fed
for
two
days.
Quick,
quick,
or
it'll
be
too
late!"
Holmes
and
I
rushed
out
and
round
the
angle
of
the
house,
with
Toller
hurrying
behind
us.
There
was
the
huge
famished
brute,
its
black
muzzle
buried
in
Rucastle's
throat,
while
he
writhed
and
screamed
upon
the
ground.
Running
up,
I
blew
its
brains
out,
and
it
fell
over
with
its
keen
white
teeth
still
meeting
in
the
great
creases
of
his
neck.
With
much
labour
we
separated
them
and
carried
him,
living
but
horribly
mangled,
into
the
house.
We
laid
him
upon
the
drawing-room
sofa,
and
having
dispatched
the
sobered
Toller
to
bear
the
news
to
his
wife,
I
did
what
I
could
to
relieve
his
pain.
We
were
all
assembled
round
him
when
the
door
opened,
and
a
tall,
gaunt
woman
entered
the
room.
"Mrs.
Toller!"
cried
Miss
Hunter.
"Yes,
miss.
Mr.
Rucastle
let
me
out
when
he
came
back
before
he
went
up
to
you.
Ah,
miss,
it
is
a
pity
you
didn't
let
me
know
what
you
were
planning,
for
I
would
have
told
you
that
your
pains
were
wasted."
"Ha!"
said
Holmes,
looking
keenly
at
her.
"It
is
clear
that
Mrs.
Toller
knows
more
about
this
matter
than
anyone
else."
"Yes,
sir,
I
do,
and
I
am
ready
enough
to
tell
what
I
know."
"Then,
pray,
sit
down,
and
let
us
hear
it
for
there
are
several
points
on
which
I
must
confess
that
I
am
still
in
the
dark."
"I
will
soon
make
it
clear
to
you,"
said
she;
"and
I'd
have
done
so
before
now
if
I
could
ha'
got
out
from
the
cellar.
If
there's
police-court
business
over
this,
you'll
remember
that
I
was
the
one
that
stood
your
friend,
and
that
I
was
Miss
Alice's
friend
too.
"She
was
never
happy
at
home,
Miss
Alice
wasn't,
from
the
time
that
her
father
married
again.
She
was
slighted
like
and
had
no
say
in
anything,
but
it
never
really
became
bad
for
her
until
after
she
met
Mr.
Fowler
at
a
friend's
house.
As
well
as
I
could
learn,
Miss
Alice
had
rights
of
her
own
by
will,
but
she
was
so
quiet
and
patient,
she
was,
that
she
never
said
a
word
about
them
but
just
left
everything
in
Mr.
Rucastle's
hands.
He
knew
he
was
safe
with
her;
but
when
there
was
a
chance
of
a
husband
coming
forward,
who
would
ask
for
all
that
the
law
would
give
him,
then
her
father
thought
it
time
to
put
a
stop
on
it.
He
wanted
her
to
sign
a
paper,
so
that
whether
she
married
or
not,
he
could
use
her
money.
When
she
wouldn't
do
it,
he
kept
on
worrying
her
until
she
got
brain-fever,
and
for
six
weeks
was
at
death's
door.
Then
she
got
better
at
last,
all
worn
to
a
shadow,
and
with
her
beautiful
hair
cut
off;
but
that
didn't
make
no
change
in
her
young
man,
and
he
stuck
to
her
as
true
as
man
could
be."
"Ah,"
said
Holmes,
"I
think
that
what
you
have
been
good
enough
to
tell
us
makes
the
matter
fairly
clear,
and
that
I
can
deduce
all
that
remains.
Mr.
Rucastle
then,
I
presume,
took
to
this
system
of
imprisonment?"
"Yes,
sir."
"And
brought
Miss
Hunter
down
from
London
in
order
to
get
rid
of
the
disagreeable
persistence
of
Mr.
Fowler."
"That
was
it,
sir."
"But
Mr.
Fowler
being
a
persevering
man,
as
a
good
seaman
should
be,
blockaded
the
house,
and
having
met
you
succeeded
by
certain
arguments,
metallic
or
otherwise,
in
convincing
you
that
your
interests
were
the
same
as
his."
"Mr.
Fowler
was
a
very
kind-spoken,
free-handed
gentleman,"
said
Mrs.
Toller
serenely.
"And
in
this
way
he
managed
that
your
good
man
should
have
no
want
of
drink,
and
that
a
ladder
should
be
ready
at
the
moment
when
your
master
had
gone
out."
"You
have
it,
sir,
just
as
it
happened."
"I
am
sure
we
owe
you
an
apology,
Mrs.
Toller,"
said
Holmes,
"for
you
have
certainly
cleared
up
everything
which
puzzled
us.
And
here
comes
the
country
surgeon
and
Mrs.
Rucastle,
so
I
think,
Watson,
that
we
had
best
escort
Miss
Hunter
back
to
Winchester,
as
it
seems
to
me
that
our
locus
standi
now
is
rather
a
questionable
one."
And
thus
was
solved
the
mystery
of
the
sinister
house
with
the
copper
beeches
in
front
of
the
door.
Mr.
Rucastle
survived,
but
was
always
a
broken
man,
kept
alive
solely
through
the
care
of
his
devoted
wife.
They
still
live
with
their
old
servants,
who
probably
know
so
much
of
Rucastle's
past
life
that
he
finds
it
difficult
to
part
from
them.
Mr.
Fowler
and
Miss
Rucastle
were
married,
by
special
license,
in
Southampton
the
day
after
their
flight,
and
he
is
now
the
holder
of
a
government
appointment
in
the
island
of
Mauritius.
As
to
Miss
Violet
Hunter,
my
friend
Holmes,
rather
to
my
disappointment,
manifested
no
further
interest
in
her
when
once
she
had
ceased
to
be
the
centre
of
one
of
his
problems,
and
she
is
now
the
head
of
a
private
school
at
Walsall,
where
I
believe
that
she
has
met
with
considerable
success.

BOOK

THE
COMING
OF
THE
MARTIANS
CHAPTER
ONE
THE
EVE
OF
THE
WAR
No
one
would
have
believed
in
the
last
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
that
this
world
was
being
watched
keenly
and
closely
by
intelligences
greater
than
man's
and
yet
as
mortal
as
his
own;
that
as
men
busied
themselves
about
their
various
concerns
they
were
scrutinised
and
studied,
perhaps
almost
as
narrowly
as
a
man
with
a
microscope
might
scrutinise
the
transient
creatures
that
swarm
and
multiply
in
a
drop
of
water.
With
infinite
complacency
men
went
to
and
fro
over
this
globe
about
their
little
affairs,
serene
in
their
assurance
of
their
empire
over
matter.
It
is
possible
that
the
infusoria
under
the
microscope
do
the
same.
No
one
gave
a
thought
to
the
older
worlds
of
space
as
sources
of
human
danger,
or
thought
of
them
only
to
dismiss
the
idea
of
life
upon
them
as
impossible
or
improbable.
It
is
curious
to
recall
some
of
the
mental
habits
of
those
departed
days.
At
most
terrestrial
men
fancied
there
might
be
other
men
upon
Mars,
perhaps
inferior
to
themselves
and
ready
to
welcome
a
missionary
enterprise.
Yet
across
the
gulf
of
space,
minds
that
are
to
our
minds
as
ours
are
to
those
of
the
beasts
that
perish,
intellects
vast
and
cool
and
unsympathetic,
regarded
this
earth
with
envious
eyes,
and
slowly
and
surely
drew
their
plans
against
us.
And
early
in
the
twentieth
century
came
the
great
disillusionment.
The
planet
Mars,
I
scarcely
need
remind
the
reader,
revolves
about
the
sun
at
a
mean
distance
of
140,000,000
miles,
and
the
light
and
heat
it
receives
from
the
sun
is
barely
half
of
that
received
by
this
world.
It
must
be,
if
the
nebular
hypothesis
has
any
truth,
older
than
our
world;
and
long
before
this
earth
ceased
to
be
molten,
life
upon
its
surface
must
have
begun
its
course.
The
fact
that
it
is
scarcely
one
seventh
of
the
volume
of
the
earth
must
have
accelerated
its
cooling
to
the
temperature
at
which
life
could
begin.
It
has
air
and
water
and
all
that
is
necessary
for
the
support
of
animated
existence.
Yet
so
vain
is
man,
and
so
blinded
by
his
vanity,
that
no
writer,
up
to
the
very
end
of
the
nineteenth
century,
expressed
any
idea
that
intelligent
life
might
have
developed
there
far,
or
indeed
at
all,
beyond
its
earthly
level.
Nor
was
it
generally
understood
that
since
Mars
is
older
than
our
earth,
with
scarcely
a
quarter
of
the
superficial
area
and
remoter
from
the
sun,
it
necessarily
follows
that
it
is
not
only
more
distant
from
time's
beginning
but
nearer
its
end.
The
secular
cooling
that
must
someday
overtake
our
planet
has
already
gone
far
indeed
with
our
neighbour.
Its
physical
condition
is
still
largely
a
mystery,
but
we
know
now
that
even
in
its
equatorial
region
the
midday
temperature
barely
approaches
that
of
our
coldest
winter.
Its
air
is
much
more
attenuated
than
ours,
its
oceans
have
shrunk
until
they
cover
but
a
third
of
its
surface,
and
as
its
slow
seasons
change
huge
snowcaps
gather
and
melt
about
either
pole
and
periodically
inundate
its
temperate
zones.
That
last
stage
of
exhaustion,
which
to
us
is
still
incredibly
remote,
has
become
a
present-day
problem
for
the
inhabitants
of
Mars.
The
immediate
pressure
of
necessity
has
brightened
their
intellects,
enlarged
their
powers,
and
hardened
their
hearts.
And
looking
across
space
with
instruments,
and
intelligences
such
as
we
have
scarcely
dreamed
of,
they
see,
at
its
nearest
distance
only
35,000,000
of
miles
sunward
of
them,
a
morning
star
of
hope,
our
own
warmer
planet,
green
with
vegetation
and
grey
with
water,
with
a
cloudy
atmosphere
eloquent
of
fertility,
with
glimpses
through
its
drifting
cloud
wisps
of
broad
stretches
of
populous
country
and
narrow,
navy-crowded
seas.
And
we
men,
the
creatures
who
inhabit
this
earth,
must
be
to
them
at
least
as
alien
and
lowly
as
are
the
monkeys
and
lemurs
to
us.
The
intellectual
side
of
man
already
admits
that
life
is
an
incessant
struggle
for
existence,
and
it
would
seem
that
this
too
is
the
belief
of
the
minds
upon
Mars.
Their
world
is
far
gone
in
its
cooling
and
this
world
is
still
crowded
with
life,
but
crowded
only
with
what
they
regard
as
inferior
animals.
To
carry
warfare
sunward
is,
indeed,
their
only
escape
from
the
destruction
that,
generation
after
generation,
creeps
upon
them.
And
before
we
judge
of
them
too
harshly
we
must
remember
what
ruthless
and
utter
destruction
our
own
species
has
wrought,
not
only
upon
animals,
such
as
the
vanished
bison
and
the
dodo,
but
upon
its
inferior
races.
The
Tasmanians,
in
spite
of
their
human
likeness,
were
entirely
swept
out
of
existence
in
a
war
of
extermination
waged
by
European
immigrants,
in
the
space
of
fifty
years.
Are
we
such
apostles
of
mercy
as
to
complain
if
the
Martians
warred
in
the
same
spirit?
The
Martians
seem
to
have
calculated
their
descent
with
amazing
subtlety--their
mathematical
learning
is
evidently
far
in
excess
of
ours--and
to
have
carried
out
their
preparations
with
a
well-nigh
perfect
unanimity.
Had
our
instruments
permitted
it,
we
might
have
seen
the
gathering
trouble
far
back
in
the
nineteenth
century.
Men
like
Schiaparelli
watched
the
red
planet--it
is
odd,
by-the-bye,
that
for
countless
centuries
Mars
has
been
the
star
of
war--but
failed
to
interpret
the
fluctuating
appearances
of
the
markings
they
mapped
so
well.
All
that
time
the
Martians
must
have
been
getting
ready.
During
the
opposition
of
1894
a
great
light
was
seen
on
the
illuminated
part
of
the
disk,
first
at
the
Lick
Observatory,
then
by
Perrotin
of
Nice,
and
then
by
other
observers.
English
readers
heard
of
it
first
in
the
issue
of
_Nature_
dated
August
2.
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
this
blaze
may
have
been
the
casting
of
the
huge
gun,
in
the
vast
pit
sunk
into
their
planet,
from
which
their
shots
were
fired
at
us.
Peculiar
markings,
as
yet
unexplained,
were
seen
near
the
site
of
that
outbreak
during
the
next
two
oppositions.
The
storm
burst
upon
us
six
years
ago
now.
As
Mars
approached
opposition,
Lavelle
of
Java
set
the
wires
of
the
astronomical
exchange
palpitating
with
the
amazing
intelligence
of
a
huge
outbreak
of
incandescent
gas
upon
the
planet.
It
had
occurred
towards
midnight
of
the
twelfth;
and
the
spectroscope,
to
which
he
had
at
once
resorted,
indicated
a
mass
of
flaming
gas,
chiefly
hydrogen,
moving
with
an
enormous
velocity
towards
this
earth.
This
jet
of
fire
had
become
invisible
about
a
quarter
past
twelve.
He
compared
it
to
a
colossal
puff
of
flame
suddenly
and
violently
squirted
out
of
the
planet,
"as
flaming
gases
rushed
out
of
a
gun."
A
singularly
appropriate
phrase
it
proved.
Yet
the
next
day
there
was
nothing
of
this
in
the
papers
except
a
little
note
in
the
_Daily
Telegraph_,
and
the
world
went
in
ignorance
of
one
of
the
gravest
dangers
that
ever
threatened
the
human
race.
I
might
not
have
heard
of
the
eruption
at
all
had
I
not
met
Ogilvy,
the
well-known
astronomer,
at
Ottershaw.
He
was
immensely
excited
at
the
news,
and
in
the
excess
of
his
feelings
invited
me
up
to
take
a
turn
with
him
that
night
in
a
scrutiny
of
the
red
planet.
In
spite
of
all
that
has
happened
since,
I
still
remember
that
vigil
very
distinctly:
the
black
and
silent
observatory,
the
shadowed
lantern
throwing
a
feeble
glow
upon
the
floor
in
the
corner,
the
steady
ticking
of
the
clockwork
of
the
telescope,
the
little
slit
in
the
roof--an
oblong
profundity
with
the
stardust
streaked
across
it.
Ogilvy
moved
about,
invisible
but
audible.
Looking
through
the
telescope,
one
saw
a
circle
of
deep
blue
and
the
little
round
planet
swimming
in
the
field.
It
seemed
such
a
little
thing,
so
bright
and
small
and
still,
faintly
marked
with
transverse
stripes,
and
slightly
flattened
from
the
perfect
round.
But
so
little
it
was,
so
silvery
warm--a
pin's-head
of
light!
It
was
as
if
it
quivered,
but
really
this
was
the
telescope
vibrating
with
the
activity
of
the
clockwork
that
kept
the
planet
in
view.
As
I
watched,
the
planet
seemed
to
grow
larger
and
smaller
and
to
advance
and
recede,
but
that
was
simply
that
my
eye
was
tired.
Forty
millions
of
miles
it
was
from
us--more
than
forty
millions
of
miles
of
void.
Few
people
realise
the
immensity
of
vacancy
in
which
the
dust
of
the
material
universe
swims.
Near
it
in
the
field,
I
remember,
were
three
faint
points
of
light,
three
telescopic
stars
infinitely
remote,
and
all
around
it
was
the
unfathomable
darkness
of
empty
space.
You
know
how
that
blackness
looks
on
a
frosty
starlight
night.
In
a
telescope
it
seems
far
profounder.
And
invisible
to
me
because
it
was
so
remote
and
small,
flying
swiftly
and
steadily
towards
me
across
that
incredible
distance,
drawing
nearer
every
minute
by
so
many
thousands
of
miles,
came
the
Thing
they
were
sending
us,
the
Thing
that
was
to
bring
so
much
struggle
and
calamity
and
death
to
the
earth.
I
never
dreamed
of
it
then
as
I
watched;
no
one
on
earth
dreamed
of
that
unerring
missile.
That
night,
too,
there
was
another
jetting
out
of
gas
from
the
distant
planet.
I
saw
it.
A
reddish
flash
at
the
edge,
the
slightest
projection
of
the
outline
just
as
the
chronometer
struck
midnight;
and
at
that
I
told
Ogilvy
and
he
took
my
place.
The
night
was
warm
and
I
was
thirsty,
and
I
went
stretching
my
legs
clumsily
and
feeling
my
way
in
the
darkness,
to
the
little
table
where
the
siphon
stood,
while
Ogilvy
exclaimed
at
the
streamer
of
gas
that
came
out
towards
us.
That
night
another
invisible
missile
started
on
its
way
to
the
earth
from
Mars,
just
a
second
or
so
under
twenty-four
hours
after
the
first
one.
I
remember
how
I
sat
on
the
table
there
in
the
blackness,
with
patches
of
green
and
crimson
swimming
before
my
eyes.
I
wished
I
had
a
light
to
smoke
by,
little
suspecting
the
meaning
of
the
minute
gleam
I
had
seen
and
all
that
it
would
presently
bring
me.
Ogilvy
watched
till
one,
and
then
gave
it
up;
and
we
lit
the
lantern
and
walked
over
to
his
house.
Down
below
in
the
darkness
were
Ottershaw
and
Chertsey
and
all
their
hundreds
of
people,
sleeping
in
peace.
He
was
full
of
speculation
that
night
about
the
condition
of
Mars,
and
scoffed
at
the
vulgar
idea
of
its
having
inhabitants
who
were
signalling
us.
His
idea
was
that
meteorites
might
be
falling
in
a
heavy
shower
upon
the
planet,
or
that
a
huge
volcanic
explosion
was
in
progress.
He
pointed
out
to
me
how
unlikely
it
was
that
organic
evolution
had
taken
the
same
direction
in
the
two
adjacent
planets.
"The
chances
against
anything
manlike
on
Mars
are
a
million
to
one,"
he
said.
Hundreds
of
observers
saw
the
flame
that
night
and
the
night
after
about
midnight,
and
again
the
night
after;
and
so
for
ten
nights,
a
flame
each
night.
Why
the
shots
ceased
after
the
tenth
no
one
on
earth
has
attempted
to
explain.
It
may
be
the
gases
of
the
firing
caused
the
Martians
inconvenience.
Dense
clouds
of
smoke
or
dust,
visible
through
a
powerful
telescope
on
earth
as
little
grey,
fluctuating
patches,
spread
through
the
clearness
of
the
planet's
atmosphere
and
obscured
its
more
familiar
features.
Even
the
daily
papers
woke
up
to
the
disturbances
at
last,
and
popular
notes
appeared
here,
there,
and
everywhere
concerning
the
volcanoes
upon
Mars.
The
seriocomic
periodical
_Punch_,
I
remember,
made
a
happy
use
of
it
in
the
political
cartoon.
And,
all
unsuspected,
those
missiles
the
Martians
had
fired
at
us
drew
earthward,
rushing
now
at
a
pace
of
many
miles
a
second
through
the
empty
gulf
of
space,
hour
by
hour
and
day
by
day,
nearer
and
nearer.
It
seems
to
me
now
almost
incredibly
wonderful
that,
with
that
swift
fate
hanging
over
us,
men
could
go
about
their
petty
concerns
as
they
did.
I
remember
how
jubilant
Markham
was
at
securing
a
new
photograph
of
the
planet
for
the
illustrated
paper
he
edited
in
those
days.
People
in
these
latter
times
scarcely
realise
the
abundance
and
enterprise
of
our
nineteenth-century
papers.
For
my
own
part,
I
was
much
occupied
in
learning
to
ride
the
bicycle,
and
busy
upon
a
series
of
papers
discussing
the
probable
developments
of
moral
ideas
as
civilisation
progressed.
One
night
(the
first
missile
then
could
scarcely
have
been
10,000,000
miles
away)
I
went
for
a
walk
with
my
wife.
It
was
starlight
and
I
explained
the
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
to
her,
and
pointed
out
Mars,
a
bright
dot
of
light
creeping
zenithward,
towards
which
so
many
telescopes
were
pointed.
It
was
a
warm
night.
Coming
home,
a
party
of
excursionists
from
Chertsey
or
Isleworth
passed
us
singing
and
playing
music.
There
were
lights
in
the
upper
windows
of
the
houses
as
the
people
went
to
bed.
From
the
railway
station
in
the
distance
came
the
sound
of
shunting
trains,
ringing
and
rumbling,
softened
almost
into
melody
by
the
distance.
My
wife
pointed
out
to
me
the
brightness
of
the
red,
green,
and
yellow
signal
lights
hanging
in
a
framework
against
the
sky.
It
seemed
so
safe
and
tranquil.
CHAPTER
TWO
THE
FALLING
STAR
Then
came
the
night
of
the
first
falling
star.
It
was
seen
early
in
the
morning,
rushing
over
Winchester
eastward,
a
line
of
flame
high
in
the
atmosphere.
Hundreds
must
have
seen
it,
and
taken
it
for
an
ordinary
falling
star.
Albin
described
it
as
leaving
a
greenish
streak
behind
it
that
glowed
for
some
seconds.
Denning,
our
greatest
authority
on
meteorites,
stated
that
the
height
of
its
first
appearance
was
about
ninety
or
one
hundred
miles.
It
seemed
to
him
that
it
fell
to
earth
about
one
hundred
miles
east
of
him.
I
was
at
home
at
that
hour
and
writing
in
my
study;
and
although
my
French
windows
face
towards
Ottershaw
and
the
blind
was
up
(for
I
loved
in
those
days
to
look
up
at
the
night
sky),
I
saw
nothing
of
it.
Yet
this
strangest
of
all
things
that
ever
came
to
earth
from
outer
space
must
have
fallen
while
I
was
sitting
there,
visible
to
me
had
I
only
looked
up
as
it
passed.
Some
of
those
who
saw
its
flight
say
it
travelled
with
a
hissing
sound.
I
myself
heard
nothing
of
that.
Many
people
in
Berkshire,
Surrey,
and
Middlesex
must
have
seen
the
fall
of
it,
and,
at
most,
have
thought
that
another
meteorite
had
descended.
No
one
seems
to
have
troubled
to
look
for
the
fallen
mass
that
night.
But
very
early
in
the
morning
poor
Ogilvy,
who
had
seen
the
shooting
star
and
who
was
persuaded
that
a
meteorite
lay
somewhere
on
the
common
between
Horsell,
Ottershaw,
and
Woking,
rose
early
with
the
idea
of
finding
it.
Find
it
he
did,
soon
after
dawn,
and
not
far
from
the
sand
pits.
An
enormous
hole
had
been
made
by
the
impact
of
the
projectile,
and
the
sand
and
gravel
had
been
flung
violently
in
every
direction
over
the
heath,
forming
heaps
visible
a
mile
and
a
half
away.
The
heather
was
on
fire
eastward,
and
a
thin
blue
smoke
rose
against
the
dawn.
The
Thing
itself
lay
almost
entirely
buried
in
sand,
amidst
the
scattered
splinters
of
a
fir
tree
it
had
shivered
to
fragments
in
its
descent.
The
uncovered
part
had
the
appearance
of
a
huge
cylinder,
caked
over
and
its
outline
softened
by
a
thick
scaly
dun-coloured
incrustation.
It
had
a
diameter
of
about
thirty
yards.
He
approached
the
mass,
surprised
at
the
size
and
more
so
at
the
shape,
since
most
meteorites
are
rounded
more
or
less
completely.
It
was,
however,
still
so
hot
from
its
flight
through
the
air
as
to
forbid
his
near
approach.
A
stirring
noise
within
its
cylinder
he
ascribed
to
the
unequal
cooling
of
its
surface;
for
at
that
time
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
it
might
be
hollow.
He
remained
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
pit
that
the
Thing
had
made
for
itself,
staring
at
its
strange
appearance,
astonished
chiefly
at
its
unusual
shape
and
colour,
and
dimly
perceiving
even
then
some
evidence
of
design
in
its
arrival.
The
early
morning
was
wonderfully
still,
and
the
sun,
just
clearing
the
pine
trees
towards
Weybridge,
was
already
warm.
He
did
not
remember
hearing
any
birds
that
morning,
there
was
certainly
no
breeze
stirring,
and
the
only
sounds
were
the
faint
movements
from
within
the
cindery
cylinder.
He
was
all
alone
on
the
common.
Then
suddenly
he
noticed
with
a
start
that
some
of
the
grey
clinker,
the
ashy
incrustation
that
covered
the
meteorite,
was
falling
off
the
circular
edge
of
the
end.
It
was
dropping
off
in
flakes
and
raining
down
upon
the
sand.
A
large
piece
suddenly
came
off
and
fell
with
a
sharp
noise
that
brought
his
heart
into
his
mouth.
For
a
minute
he
scarcely
realised
what
this
meant,
and,
although
the
heat
was
excessive,
he
clambered
down
into
the
pit
close
to
the
bulk
to
see
the
Thing
more
clearly.
He
fancied
even
then
that
the
cooling
of
the
body
might
account
for
this,
but
what
disturbed
that
idea
was
the
fact
that
the
ash
was
falling
only
from
the
end
of
the
cylinder.
And
then
he
perceived
that,
very
slowly,
the
circular
top
of
the
cylinder
was
rotating
on
its
body.
It
was
such
a
gradual
movement
that
he
discovered
it
only
through
noticing
that
a
black
mark
that
had
been
near
him
five
minutes
ago
was
now
at
the
other
side
of
the
circumference.
Even
then
he
scarcely
understood
what
this
indicated,
until
he
heard
a
muffled
grating
sound
and
saw
the
black
mark
jerk
forward
an
inch
or
so.
Then
the
thing
came
upon
him
in
a
flash.
The
cylinder
was
artificial--hollow--with
an
end
that
screwed
out!
Something
within
the
cylinder
was
unscrewing
the
top!
"Good
heavens!"
said
Ogilvy.
"There's
a
man
in
it--men
in
it!
Half
roasted
to
death!
Trying
to
escape!"
At
once,
with
a
quick
mental
leap,
he
linked
the
Thing
with
the
flash
upon
Mars.
The
thought
of
the
confined
creature
was
so
dreadful
to
him
that
he
forgot
the
heat
and
went
forward
to
the
cylinder
to
help
turn.
But
luckily
the
dull
radiation
arrested
him
before
he
could
burn
his
hands
on
the
still-glowing
metal.
At
that
he
stood
irresolute
for
a
moment,
then
turned,
scrambled
out
of
the
pit,
and
set
off
running
wildly
into
Woking.
The
time
then
must
have
been
somewhere
about
six
o'clock.
He
met
a
waggoner
and
tried
to
make
him
understand,
but
the
tale
he
told
and
his
appearance
were
so
wild--his
hat
had
fallen
off
in
the
pit--that
the
man
simply
drove
on.
He
was
equally
unsuccessful
with
the
potman
who
was
just
unlocking
the
doors
of
the
public-house
by
Horsell
Bridge.
The
fellow
thought
he
was
a
lunatic
at
large
and
made
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
shut
him
into
the
taproom.
That
sobered
him
a
little;
and
when
he
saw
Henderson,
the
London
journalist,
in
his
garden,
he
called
over
the
palings
and
made
himself
understood.
"Henderson,"
he
called,
"you
saw
that
shooting
star
last
night?"
"Well?"
said
Henderson.
"It's
out
on
Horsell
Common
now."
"Good
Lord!"
said
Henderson.
"Fallen
meteorite!
That's
good."
"But
it's
something
more
than
a
meteorite.
It's
a
cylinder--an
artificial
cylinder,
man!
And
there's
something
inside."
Henderson
stood
up
with
his
spade
in
his
hand.
"What's
that?"
he
said.
He
was
deaf
in
one
ear.
Ogilvy
told
him
all
that
he
had
seen.
Henderson
was
a
minute
or
so
taking
it
in.
Then
he
dropped
his
spade,
snatched
up
his
jacket,
and
came
out
into
the
road.
The
two
men
hurried
back
at
once
to
the
common,
and
found
the
cylinder
still
lying
in
the
same
position.
But
now
the
sounds
inside
had
ceased,
and
a
thin
circle
of
bright
metal
showed
between
the
top
and
the
body
of
the
cylinder.
Air
was
either
entering
or
escaping
at
the
rim
with
a
thin,
sizzling
sound.
They
listened,
rapped
on
the
scaly
burnt
metal
with
a
stick,
and,
meeting
with
no
response,
they
both
concluded
the
man
or
men
inside
must
be
insensible
or
dead.
Of
course
the
two
were
quite
unable
to
do
anything.
They
shouted
consolation
and
promises,
and
went
off
back
to
the
town
again
to
get
help.
One
can
imagine
them,
covered
with
sand,
excited
and
disordered,
running
up
the
little
street
in
the
bright
sunlight
just
as
the
shop
folks
were
taking
down
their
shutters
and
people
were
opening
their
bedroom
windows.
Henderson
went
into
the
railway
station
at
once,
in
order
to
telegraph
the
news
to
London.
The
newspaper
articles
had
prepared
men's
minds
for
the
reception
of
the
idea.
By
eight
o'clock
a
number
of
boys
and
unemployed
men
had
already
started
for
the
common
to
see
the
"dead
men
from
Mars."
That
was
the
form
the
story
took.
I
heard
of
it
first
from
my
newspaper
boy
about
a
quarter
to
nine
when
I
went
out
to
get
my
_Daily
Chronicle_.
I
was
naturally
startled,
and
lost
no
time
in
going
out
and
across
the
Ottershaw
bridge
to
the
sand
pits.
CHAPTER
THREE
ON
HORSELL
COMMON
I
found
a
little
crowd
of
perhaps
twenty
people
surrounding
the
huge
hole
in
which
the
cylinder
lay.
I
have
already
described
the
appearance
of
that
colossal
bulk,
embedded
in
the
ground.
The
turf
and
gravel
about
it
seemed
charred
as
if
by
a
sudden
explosion.
No
doubt
its
impact
had
caused
a
flash
of
fire.
Henderson
and
Ogilvy
were
not
there.
I
think
they
perceived
that
nothing
was
to
be
done
for
the
present,
and
had
gone
away
to
breakfast
at
Henderson's
house.
There
were
four
or
five
boys
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
Pit,
with
their
feet
dangling,
and
amusing
themselves--until
I
stopped
them--by
throwing
stones
at
the
giant
mass.
After
I
had
spoken
to
them
about
it,
they
began
playing
at
"touch"
in
and
out
of
the
group
of
bystanders.
Among
these
were
a
couple
of
cyclists,
a
jobbing
gardener
I
employed
sometimes,
a
girl
carrying
a
baby,
Gregg
the
butcher
and
his
little
boy,
and
two
or
three
loafers
and
golf
caddies
who
were
accustomed
to
hang
about
the
railway
station.
There
was
very
little
talking.
Few
of
the
common
people
in
England
had
anything
but
the
vaguest
astronomical
ideas
in
those
days.
Most
of
them
were
staring
quietly
at
the
big
table
like
end
of
the
cylinder,
which
was
still
as
Ogilvy
and
Henderson
had
left
it.
I
fancy
the
popular
expectation
of
a
heap
of
charred
corpses
was
disappointed
at
this
inanimate
bulk.
Some
went
away
while
I
was
there,
and
other
people
came.
I
clambered
into
the
pit
and
fancied
I
heard
a
faint
movement
under
my
feet.
The
top
had
certainly
ceased
to
rotate.
It
was
only
when
I
got
thus
close
to
it
that
the
strangeness
of
this
object
was
at
all
evident
to
me.
At
the
first
glance
it
was
really
no
more
exciting
than
an
overturned
carriage
or
a
tree
blown
across
the
road.
Not
so
much
so,
indeed.
It
looked
like
a
rusty
gas
float.
It
required
a
certain
amount
of
scientific
education
to
perceive
that
the
grey
scale
of
the
Thing
was
no
common
oxide,
that
the
yellowish-white
metal
that
gleamed
in
the
crack
between
the
lid
and
the
cylinder
had
an
unfamiliar
hue.
"Extra-terrestrial"
had
no
meaning
for
most
of
the
onlookers.
At
that
time
it
was
quite
clear
in
my
own
mind
that
the
Thing
had
come
from
the
planet
Mars,
but
I
judged
it
improbable
that
it
contained
any
living
creature.
I
thought
the
unscrewing
might
be
automatic.
In
spite
of
Ogilvy,
I
still
believed
that
there
were
men
in
Mars.
My
mind
ran
fancifully
on
the
possibilities
of
its
containing
manuscript,
on
the
difficulties
in
translation
that
might
arise,
whether
we
should
find
coins
and
models
in
it,
and
so
forth.
Yet
it
was
a
little
too
large
for
assurance
on
this
idea.
I
felt
an
impatience
to
see
it
opened.
About
eleven,
as
nothing
seemed
happening,
I
walked
back,
full
of
such
thought,
to
my
home
in
Maybury.
But
I
found
it
difficult
to
get
to
work
upon
my
abstract
investigations.
In
the
afternoon
the
appearance
of
the
common
had
altered
very
much.
The
early
editions
of
the
evening
papers
had
startled
London
with
enormous
headlines:
"A
MESSAGE
RECEIVED
FROM
MARS."
"REMARKABLE
STORY
FROM
WOKING,"
and
so
forth.
In
addition,
Ogilvy's
wire
to
the
Astronomical
Exchange
had
roused
every
observatory
in
the
three
kingdoms.
There
were
half
a
dozen
flies
or
more
from
the
Woking
station
standing
in
the
road
by
the
sand
pits,
a
basket-chaise
from
Chobham,
and
a
rather
lordly
carriage.
Besides
that,
there
was
quite
a
heap
of
bicycles.
In
addition,
a
large
number
of
people
must
have
walked,
in
spite
of
the
heat
of
the
day,
from
Woking
and
Chertsey,
so
that
there
was
altogether
quite
a
considerable
crowd--one
or
two
gaily
dressed
ladies
among
the
others.
It
was
glaringly
hot,
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
nor
a
breath
of
wind,
and
the
only
shadow
was
that
of
the
few
scattered
pine
trees.
The
burning
heather
had
been
extinguished,
but
the
level
ground
towards
Ottershaw
was
blackened
as
far
as
one
could
see,
and
still
giving
off
vertical
streamers
of
smoke.
An
enterprising
sweet-stuff
dealer
in
the
Chobham
Road
had
sent
up
his
son
with
a
barrow-load
of
green
apples
and
ginger
beer.
Going
to
the
edge
of
the
pit,
I
found
it
occupied
by
a
group
of
about
half
a
dozen
men--Henderson,
Ogilvy,
and
a
tall,
fair-haired
man
that
I
afterwards
learned
was
Stent,
the
Astronomer
Royal,
with
several
workmen
wielding
spades
and
pickaxes.
Stent
was
giving
directions
in
a
clear,
high-pitched
voice.
He
was
standing
on
the
cylinder,
which
was
now
evidently
much
cooler;
his
face
was
crimson
and
streaming
with
perspiration,
and
something
seemed
to
have
irritated
him.
A
large
portion
of
the
cylinder
had
been
uncovered,
though
its
lower
end
was
still
embedded.
As
soon
as
Ogilvy
saw
me
among
the
staring
crowd
on
the
edge
of
the
pit
he
called
to
me
to
come
down,
and
asked
me
if
I
would
mind
going
over
to
see
Lord
Hilton,
the
lord
of
the
manor.
The
growing
crowd,
he
said,
was
becoming
a
serious
impediment
to
their
excavations,
especially
the
boys.
They
wanted
a
light
railing
put
up,
and
help
to
keep
the
people
back.
He
told
me
that
a
faint
stirring
was
occasionally
still
audible
within
the
case,
but
that
the
workmen
had
failed
to
unscrew
the
top,
as
it
afforded
no
grip
to
them.
The
case
appeared
to
be
enormously
thick,
and
it
was
possible
that
the
faint
sounds
we
heard
represented
a
noisy
tumult
in
the
interior.
I
was
very
glad
to
do
as
he
asked,
and
so
become
one
of
the
privileged
spectators
within
the
contemplated
enclosure.
I
failed
to
find
Lord
Hilton
at
his
house,
but
I
was
told
he
was
expected
from
London
by
the
six
o'clock
train
from
Waterloo;
and
as
it
was
then
about
a
quarter
past
five,
I
went
home,
had
some
tea,
and
walked
up
to
the
station
to
waylay
him.
CHAPTER
FOUR
THE
CYLINDER
OPENS
When
I
returned
to
the
common
the
sun
was
setting.
Scattered
groups
were
hurrying
from
the
direction
of
Woking,
and
one
or
two
persons
were
returning.
The
crowd
about
the
pit
had
increased,
and
stood
out
black
against
the
lemon
yellow
of
the
sky--a
couple
of
hundred
people,
perhaps.
There
were
raised
voices,
and
some
sort
of
struggle
appeared
to
be
going
on
about
the
pit.
Strange
imaginings
passed
through
my
mind.
As
I
drew
nearer
I
heard
Stent's
voice:
"Keep
back!
Keep
back!"
A
boy
came
running
towards
me.
"It's
a-movin',"
he
said
to
me
as
he
passed;
"a-screwin'
and
a-screwin'
out.
I
don't
like
it.
I'm
a-goin'
'ome,
I
am."
I
went
on
to
the
crowd.
There
were
really,
I
should
think,
two
or
three
hundred
people
elbowing
and
jostling
one
another,
the
one
or
two
ladies
there
being
by
no
means
the
least
active.
"He's
fallen
in
the
pit!"
cried
some
one.
"Keep
back!"
said
several.
The
crowd
swayed
a
little,
and
I
elbowed
my
way
through.
Every
one
seemed
greatly
excited.
I
heard
a
peculiar
humming
sound
from
the
pit.
"I
say!"
said
Ogilvy;
"help
keep
these
idiots
back.
We
don't
know
what's
in
the
confounded
thing,
you
know!"
I
saw
a
young
man,
a
shop
assistant
in
Woking
I
believe
he
was,
standing
on
the
cylinder
and
trying
to
scramble
out
of
the
hole
again.
The
crowd
had
pushed
him
in.
The
end
of
the
cylinder
was
being
screwed
out
from
within.
Nearly
two
feet
of
shining
screw
projected.
Somebody
blundered
against
me,
and
I
narrowly
missed
being
pitched
onto
the
top
of
the
screw.
I
turned,
and
as
I
did
so
the
screw
must
have
come
out,
for
the
lid
of
the
cylinder
fell
upon
the
gravel
with
a
ringing
concussion.
I
stuck
my
elbow
into
the
person
behind
me,
and
turned
my
head
towards
the
Thing
again.
For
a
moment
that
circular
cavity
seemed
perfectly
black.
I
had
the
sunset
in
my
eyes.
I
think
everyone
expected
to
see
a
man
emerge--possibly
something
a
little
unlike
us
terrestrial
men,
but
in
all
essentials
a
man.
I
know
I
did.
But,
looking,
I
presently
saw
something
stirring
within
the
shadow:
greyish
billowy
movements,
one
above
another,
and
then
two
luminous
disks--like
eyes.
Then
something
resembling
a
little
grey
snake,
about
the
thickness
of
a
walking
stick,
coiled
up
out
of
the
writhing
middle,
and
wriggled
in
the
air
towards
me--and
then
another.
A
sudden
chill
came
over
me.
There
was
a
loud
shriek
from
a
woman
behind.
I
half
turned,
keeping
my
eyes
fixed
upon
the
cylinder
still,
from
which
other
tentacles
were
now
projecting,
and
began
pushing
my
way
back
from
the
edge
of
the
pit.
I
saw
astonishment
giving
place
to
horror
on
the
faces
of
the
people
about
me.
I
heard
inarticulate
exclamations
on
all
sides.
There
was
a
general
movement
backwards.
I
saw
the
shopman
struggling
still
on
the
edge
of
the
pit.
I
found
myself
alone,
and
saw
the
people
on
the
other
side
of
the
pit
running
off,
Stent
among
them.
I
looked
again
at
the
cylinder,
and
ungovernable
terror
gripped
me.
I
stood
petrified
and
staring.
A
big
greyish
rounded
bulk,
the
size,
perhaps,
of
a
bear,
was
rising
slowly
and
painfully
out
of
the
cylinder.
As
it
bulged
up
and
caught
the
light,
it
glistened
like
wet
leather.
Two
large
dark-coloured
eyes
were
regarding
me
steadfastly.
The
mass
that
framed
them,
the
head
of
the
thing,
was
rounded,
and
had,
one
might
say,
a
face.
There
was
a
mouth
under
the
eyes,
the
lipless
brim
of
which
quivered
and
panted,
and
dropped
saliva.
The
whole
creature
heaved
and
pulsated
convulsively.
A
lank
tentacular
appendage
gripped
the
edge
of
the
cylinder,
another
swayed
in
the
air.
Those
who
have
never
seen
a
living
Martian
can
scarcely
imagine
the
strange
horror
of
its
appearance.
The
peculiar
V-shaped
mouth
with
its
pointed
upper
lip,
the
absence
of
brow
ridges,
the
absence
of
a
chin
beneath
the
wedgelike
lower
lip,
the
incessant
quivering
of
this
mouth,
the
Gorgon
groups
of
tentacles,
the
tumultuous
breathing
of
the
lungs
in
a
strange
atmosphere,
the
evident
heaviness
and
painfulness
of
movement
due
to
the
greater
gravitational
energy
of
the
earth--above
all,
the
extraordinary
intensity
of
the
immense
eyes--were
at
once
vital,
intense,
inhuman,
crippled
and
monstrous.
There
was
something
fungoid
in
the
oily
brown
skin,
something
in
the
clumsy
deliberation
of
the
tedious
movements
unspeakably
nasty.
Even
at
this
first
encounter,
this
first
glimpse,
I
was
overcome
with
disgust
and
dread.
Suddenly
the
monster
vanished.
It
had
toppled
over
the
brim
of
the
cylinder
and
fallen
into
the
pit,
with
a
thud
like
the
fall
of
a
great
mass
of
leather.
I
heard
it
give
a
peculiar
thick
cry,
and
forthwith
another
of
these
creatures
appeared
darkly
in
the
deep
shadow
of
the
aperture.
I
turned
and,
running
madly,
made
for
the
first
group
of
trees,
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
away;
but
I
ran
slantingly
and
stumbling,
for
I
could
not
avert
my
face
from
these
things.
There,
among
some
young
pine
trees
and
furze
bushes,
I
stopped,
panting,
and
waited
further
developments.
The
common
round
the
sand
pits
was
dotted
with
people,
standing
like
myself
in
a
half-fascinated
terror,
staring
at
these
creatures,
or
rather
at
the
heaped
gravel
at
the
edge
of
the
pit
in
which
they
lay.
And
then,
with
a
renewed
horror,
I
saw
a
round,
black
object
bobbing
up
and
down
on
the
edge
of
the
pit.
It
was
the
head
of
the
shopman
who
had
fallen
in,
but
showing
as
a
little
black
object
against
the
hot
western
sun.
Now
he
got
his
shoulder
and
knee
up,
and
again
he
seemed
to
slip
back
until
only
his
head
was
visible.
Suddenly
he
vanished,
and
I
could
have
fancied
a
faint
shriek
had
reached
me.
I
had
a
momentary
impulse
to
go
back
and
help
him
that
my
fears
overruled.
Everything
was
then
quite
invisible,
hidden
by
the
deep
pit
and
the
heap
of
sand
that
the
fall
of
the
cylinder
had
made.
Anyone
coming
along
the
road
from
Chobham
or
Woking
would
have
been
amazed
at
the
sight--a
dwindling
multitude
of
perhaps
a
hundred
people
or
more
standing
in
a
great
irregular
circle,
in
ditches,
behind
bushes,
behind
gates
and
hedges,
saying
little
to
one
another
and
that
in
short,
excited
shouts,
and
staring,
staring
hard
at
a
few
heaps
of
sand.
The
barrow
of
ginger
beer
stood,
a
queer
derelict,
black
against
the
burning
sky,
and
in
the
sand
pits
was
a
row
of
deserted
vehicles
with
their
horses
feeding
out
of
nosebags
or
pawing
the
ground.
CHAPTER
FIVE
THE
HEAT-RAY
After
the
glimpse
I
had
had
of
the
Martians
emerging
from
the
cylinder
in
which
they
had
come
to
the
earth
from
their
planet,
a
kind
of
fascination
paralysed
my
actions.
I
remained
standing
knee-deep
in
the
heather,
staring
at
the
mound
that
hid
them.
I
was
a
battleground
of
fear
and
curiosity.
I
did
not
dare
to
go
back
towards
the
pit,
but
I
felt
a
passionate
longing
to
peer
into
it.
I
began
walking,
therefore,
in
a
big
curve,
seeking
some
point
of
vantage
and
continually
looking
at
the
sand
heaps
that
hid
these
new-comers
to
our
earth.
Once
a
leash
of
thin
black
whips,
like
the
arms
of
an
octopus,
flashed
across
the
sunset
and
was
immediately
withdrawn,
and
afterwards
a
thin
rod
rose
up,
joint
by
joint,
bearing
at
its
apex
a
circular
disk
that
spun
with
a
wobbling
motion.
What
could
be
going
on
there?
Most
of
the
spectators
had
gathered
in
one
or
two
groups--one
a
little
crowd
towards
Woking,
the
other
a
knot
of
people
in
the
direction
of
Chobham.
Evidently
they
shared
my
mental
conflict.
There
were
few
near
me.
One
man
I
approached--he
was,
I
perceived,
a
neighbour
of
mine,
though
I
did
not
know
his
name--and
accosted.
But
it
was
scarcely
a
time
for
articulate
conversation.
"What
ugly
_brutes_!"
he
said.
"Good
God!
What
ugly
brutes!"
He
repeated
this
over
and
over
again.
"Did
you
see
a
man
in
the
pit?"
I
said;
but
he
made
no
answer
to
that.
We
became
silent,
and
stood
watching
for
a
time
side
by
side,
deriving,
I
fancy,
a
certain
comfort
in
one
another's
company.
Then
I
shifted
my
position
to
a
little
knoll
that
gave
me
the
advantage
of
a
yard
or
more
of
elevation
and
when
I
looked
for
him
presently
he
was
walking
towards
Woking.
The
sunset
faded
to
twilight
before
anything
further
happened.
The
crowd
far
away
on
the
left,
towards
Woking,
seemed
to
grow,
and
I
heard
now
a
faint
murmur
from
it.
The
little
knot
of
people
towards
Chobham
dispersed.
There
was
scarcely
an
intimation
of
movement
from
the
pit.
It
was
this,
as
much
as
anything,
that
gave
people
courage,
and
I
suppose
the
new
arrivals
from
Woking
also
helped
to
restore
confidence.
At
any
rate,
as
the
dusk
came
on
a
slow,
intermittent
movement
upon
the
sand
pits
began,
a
movement
that
seemed
to
gather
force
as
the
stillness
of
the
evening
about
the
cylinder
remained
unbroken.
Vertical
black
figures
in
twos
and
threes
would
advance,
stop,
watch,
and
advance
again,
spreading
out
as
they
did
so
in
a
thin
irregular
crescent
that
promised
to
enclose
the
pit
in
its
attenuated
horns.
I,
too,
on
my
side
began
to
move
towards
the
pit.
Then
I
saw
some
cabmen
and
others
had
walked
boldly
into
the
sand
pits,
and
heard
the
clatter
of
hoofs
and
the
gride
of
wheels.
I
saw
a
lad
trundling
off
the
barrow
of
apples.
And
then,
within
thirty
yards
of
the
pit,
advancing
from
the
direction
of
Horsell,
I
noted
a
little
black
knot
of
men,
the
foremost
of
whom
was
waving
a
white
flag.
This
was
the
Deputation.
There
had
been
a
hasty
consultation,
and
since
the
Martians
were
evidently,
in
spite
of
their
repulsive
forms,
intelligent
creatures,
it
had
been
resolved
to
show
them,
by
approaching
them
with
signals,
that
we
too
were
intelligent.
Flutter,
flutter,
went
the
flag,
first
to
the
right,
then
to
the
left.
It
was
too
far
for
me
to
recognise
anyone
there,
but
afterwards
I
learned
that
Ogilvy,
Stent,
and
Henderson
were
with
others
in
this
attempt
at
communication.
This
little
group
had
in
its
advance
dragged
inward,
so
to
speak,
the
circumference
of
the
now
almost
complete
circle
of
people,
and
a
number
of
dim
black
figures
followed
it
at
discreet
distances.
Suddenly
there
was
a
flash
of
light,
and
a
quantity
of
luminous
greenish
smoke
came
out
of
the
pit
in
three
distinct
puffs,
which
drove
up,
one
after
the
other,
straight
into
the
still
air.
This
smoke
(or
flame,
perhaps,
would
be
the
better
word
for
it)
was
so
bright
that
the
deep
blue
sky
overhead
and
the
hazy
stretches
of
brown
common
towards
Chertsey,
set
with
black
pine
trees,
seemed
to
darken
abruptly
as
these
puffs
arose,
and
to
remain
the
darker
after
their
dispersal.
At
the
same
time
a
faint
hissing
sound
became
audible.
Beyond
the
pit
stood
the
little
wedge
of
people
with
the
white
flag
at
its
apex,
arrested
by
these
phenomena,
a
little
knot
of
small
vertical
black
shapes
upon
the
black
ground.
As
the
green
smoke
arose,
their
faces
flashed
out
pallid
green,
and
faded
again
as
it
vanished.
Then
slowly
the
hissing
passed
into
a
humming,
into
a
long,
loud,
droning
noise.
Slowly
a
humped
shape
rose
out
of
the
pit,
and
the
ghost
of
a
beam
of
light
seemed
to
flicker
out
from
it.
Forthwith
flashes
of
actual
flame,
a
bright
glare
leaping
from
one
to
another,
sprang
from
the
scattered
group
of
men.
It
was
as
if
some
invisible
jet
impinged
upon
them
and
flashed
into
white
flame.
It
was
as
if
each
man
were
suddenly
and
momentarily
turned
to
fire.
Then,
by
the
light
of
their
own
destruction,
I
saw
them
staggering
and
falling,
and
their
supporters
turning
to
run.
I
stood
staring,
not
as
yet
realising
that
this
was
death
leaping
from
man
to
man
in
that
little
distant
crowd.
All
I
felt
was
that
it
was
something
very
strange.
An
almost
noiseless
and
blinding
flash
of
light,
and
a
man
fell
headlong
and
lay
still;
and
as
the
unseen
shaft
of
heat
passed
over
them,
pine
trees
burst
into
fire,
and
every
dry
furze
bush
became
with
one
dull
thud
a
mass
of
flames.
And
far
away
towards
Knaphill
I
saw
the
flashes
of
trees
and
hedges
and
wooden
buildings
suddenly
set
alight.
It
was
sweeping
round
swiftly
and
steadily,
this
flaming
death,
this
invisible,
inevitable
sword
of
heat.
I
perceived
it
coming
towards
me
by
the
flashing
bushes
it
touched,
and
was
too
astounded
and
stupefied
to
stir.
I
heard
the
crackle
of
fire
in
the
sand
pits
and
the
sudden
squeal
of
a
horse
that
was
as
suddenly
stilled.
Then
it
was
as
if
an
invisible
yet
intensely
heated
finger
were
drawn
through
the
heather
between
me
and
the
Martians,
and
all
along
a
curving
line
beyond
the
sand
pits
the
dark
ground
smoked
and
crackled.
Something
fell
with
a
crash
far
away
to
the
left
where
the
road
from
Woking
station
opens
out
on
the
common.
Forth-with
the
hissing
and
humming
ceased,
and
the
black,
dome-like
object
sank
slowly
out
of
sight
into
the
pit.
All
this
had
happened
with
such
swiftness
that
I
had
stood
motionless,
dumbfounded
and
dazzled
by
the
flashes
of
light.
Had
that
death
swept
through
a
full
circle,
it
must
inevitably
have
slain
me
in
my
surprise.
But
it
passed
and
spared
me,
and
left
the
night
about
me
suddenly
dark
and
unfamiliar.
The
undulating
common
seemed
now
dark
almost
to
blackness,
except
where
its
roadways
lay
grey
and
pale
under
the
deep
blue
sky
of
the
early
night.
It
was
dark,
and
suddenly
void
of
men.
Overhead
the
stars
were
mustering,
and
in
the
west
the
sky
was
still
a
pale,
bright,
almost
greenish
blue.
The
tops
of
the
pine
trees
and
the
roofs
of
Horsell
came
out
sharp
and
black
against
the
western
afterglow.
The
Martians
and
their
appliances
were
altogether
invisible,
save
for
that
thin
mast
upon
which
their
restless
mirror
wobbled.
Patches
of
bush
and
isolated
trees
here
and
there
smoked
and
glowed
still,
and
the
houses
towards
Woking
station
were
sending
up
spires
of
flame
into
the
stillness
of
the
evening
air.
Nothing
was
changed
save
for
that
and
a
terrible
astonishment.
The
little
group
of
black
specks
with
the
flag
of
white
had
been
swept
out
of
existence,
and
the
stillness
of
the
evening,
so
it
seemed
to
me,
had
scarcely
been
broken.
It
came
to
me
that
I
was
upon
this
dark
common,
helpless,
unprotected,
and
alone.
Suddenly,
like
a
thing
falling
upon
me
from
without,
came--fear.
With
an
effort
I
turned
and
began
a
stumbling
run
through
the
heather.
The
fear
I
felt
was
no
rational
fear,
but
a
panic
terror
not
only
of
the
Martians,
but
of
the
dusk
and
stillness
all
about
me.
Such
an
extraordinary
effect
in
unmanning
me
it
had
that
I
ran
weeping
silently
as
a
child
might
do.
Once
I
had
turned,
I
did
not
dare
to
look
back.
I
remember
I
felt
an
extraordinary
persuasion
that
I
was
being
played
with,
that
presently,
when
I
was
upon
the
very
verge
of
safety,
this
mysterious
death--as
swift
as
the
passage
of
light--would
leap
after
me
from
the
pit
about
the
cylinder
and
strike
me
down.
CHAPTER
SIX
THE
HEAT-RAY
IN
THE
CHOBHAM
ROAD
It
is
still
a
matter
of
wonder
how
the
Martians
are
able
to
slay
men
so
swiftly
and
so
silently.
Many
think
that
in
some
way
they
are
able
to
generate
an
intense
heat
in
a
chamber
of
practically
absolute
non-conductivity.
This
intense
heat
they
project
in
a
parallel
beam
against
any
object
they
choose,
by
means
of
a
polished
parabolic
mirror
of
unknown
composition,
much
as
the
parabolic
mirror
of
a
lighthouse
projects
a
beam
of
light.
But
no
one
has
absolutely
proved
these
details.
However
it
is
done,
it
is
certain
that
a
beam
of
heat
is
the
essence
of
the
matter.
Heat,
and
invisible,
instead
of
visible,
light.
Whatever
is
combustible
flashes
into
flame
at
its
touch,
lead
runs
like
water,
it
softens
iron,
cracks
and
melts
glass,
and
when
it
falls
upon
water,
incontinently
that
explodes
into
steam.
That
night
nearly
forty
people
lay
under
the
starlight
about
the
pit,
charred
and
distorted
beyond
recognition,
and
all
night
long
the
common
from
Horsell
to
Maybury
was
deserted
and
brightly
ablaze.
The
news
of
the
massacre
probably
reached
Chobham,
Woking,
and
Ottershaw
about
the
same
time.
In
Woking
the
shops
had
closed
when
the
tragedy
happened,
and
a
number
of
people,
shop
people
and
so
forth,
attracted
by
the
stories
they
had
heard,
were
walking
over
the
Horsell
Bridge
and
along
the
road
between
the
hedges
that
runs
out
at
last
upon
the
common.
You
may
imagine
the
young
people
brushed
up
after
the
labours
of
the
day,
and
making
this
novelty,
as
they
would
make
any
novelty,
the
excuse
for
walking
together
and
enjoying
a
trivial
flirtation.
You
may
figure
to
yourself
the
hum
of
voices
along
the
road
in
the
gloaming.
.
.
.
As
yet,
of
course,
few
people
in
Woking
even
knew
that
the
cylinder
had
opened,
though
poor
Henderson
had
sent
a
messenger
on
a
bicycle
to
the
post
office
with
a
special
wire
to
an
evening
paper.
As
these
folks
came
out
by
twos
and
threes
upon
the
open,
they
found
little
knots
of
people
talking
excitedly
and
peering
at
the
spinning
mirror
over
the
sand
pits,
and
the
newcomers
were,
no
doubt,
soon
infected
by
the
excitement
of
the
occasion.
By
half
past
eight,
when
the
Deputation
was
destroyed,
there
may
have
been
a
crowd
of
three
hundred
people
or
more
at
this
place,
besides
those
who
had
left
the
road
to
approach
the
Martians
nearer.
There
were
three
policemen
too,
one
of
whom
was
mounted,
doing
their
best,
under
instructions
from
Stent,
to
keep
the
people
back
and
deter
them
from
approaching
the
cylinder.
There
was
some
booing
from
those
more
thoughtless
and
excitable
souls
to
whom
a
crowd
is
always
an
occasion
for
noise
and
horse-play.
Stent
and
Ogilvy,
anticipating
some
possibilities
of
a
collision,
had
telegraphed
from
Horsell
to
the
barracks
as
soon
as
the
Martians
emerged,
for
the
help
of
a
company
of
soldiers
to
protect
these
strange
creatures
from
violence.
After
that
they
returned
to
lead
that
ill-fated
advance.
The
description
of
their
death,
as
it
was
seen
by
the
crowd,
tallies
very
closely
with
my
own
impressions:
the
three
puffs
of
green
smoke,
the
deep
humming
note,
and
the
flashes
of
flame.
But
that
crowd
of
people
had
a
far
narrower
escape
than
mine.
Only
the
fact
that
a
hummock
of
heathery
sand
intercepted
the
lower
part
of
the
Heat-Ray
saved
them.
Had
the
elevation
of
the
parabolic
mirror
been
a
few
yards
higher,
none
could
have
lived
to
tell
the
tale.
They
saw
the
flashes
and
the
men
falling
and
an
invisible
hand,
as
it
were,
lit
the
bushes
as
it
hurried
towards
them
through
the
twilight.
Then,
with
a
whistling
note
that
rose
above
the
droning
of
the
pit,
the
beam
swung
close
over
their
heads,
lighting
the
tops
of
the
beech
trees
that
line
the
road,
and
splitting
the
bricks,
smashing
the
windows,
firing
the
window
frames,
and
bringing
down
in
crumbling
ruin
a
portion
of
the
gable
of
the
house
nearest
the
corner.
In
the
sudden
thud,
hiss,
and
glare
of
the
igniting
trees,
the
panic-stricken
crowd
seems
to
have
swayed
hesitatingly
for
some
moments.
Sparks
and
burning
twigs
began
to
fall
into
the
road,
and
single
leaves
like
puffs
of
flame.
Hats
and
dresses
caught
fire.
Then
came
a
crying
from
the
common.
There
were
shrieks
and
shouts,
and
suddenly
a
mounted
policeman
came
galloping
through
the
confusion
with
his
hands
clasped
over
his
head,
screaming.
"They're
coming!"
a
woman
shrieked,
and
incontinently
everyone
was
turning
and
pushing
at
those
behind,
in
order
to
clear
their
way
to
Woking
again.
They
must
have
bolted
as
blindly
as
a
flock
of
sheep.
Where
the
road
grows
narrow
and
black
between
the
high
banks
the
crowd
jammed,
and
a
desperate
struggle
occurred.
All
that
crowd
did
not
escape;
three
persons
at
least,
two
women
and
a
little
boy,
were
crushed
and
trampled
there,
and
left
to
die
amid
the
terror
and
the
darkness.
CHAPTER
SEVEN
HOW
I
REACHED
HOME
For
my
own
part,
I
remember
nothing
of
my
flight
except
the
stress
of
blundering
against
trees
and
stumbling
through
the
heather.
All
about
me
gathered
the
invisible
terrors
of
the
Martians;
that
pitiless
sword
of
heat
seemed
whirling
to
and
fro,
flourishing
overhead
before
it
descended
and
smote
me
out
of
life.
I
came
into
the
road
between
the
crossroads
and
Horsell,
and
ran
along
this
to
the
crossroads.
At
last
I
could
go
no
further;
I
was
exhausted
with
the
violence
of
my
emotion
and
of
my
flight,
and
I
staggered
and
fell
by
the
wayside.
That
was
near
the
bridge
that
crosses
the
canal
by
the
gasworks.
I
fell
and
lay
still.
I
must
have
remained
there
some
time.
I
sat
up,
strangely
perplexed.
For
a
moment,
perhaps,
I
could
not
clearly
understand
how
I
came
there.
My
terror
had
fallen
from
me
like
a
garment.
My
hat
had
gone,
and
my
collar
had
burst
away
from
its
fastener.
A
few
minutes
before,
there
had
only
been
three
real
things
before
me--the
immensity
of
the
night
and
space
and
nature,
my
own
feebleness
and
anguish,
and
the
near
approach
of
death.
Now
it
was
as
if
something
turned
over,
and
the
point
of
view
altered
abruptly.
There
was
no
sensible
transition
from
one
state
of
mind
to
the
other.
I
was
immediately
the
self
of
every
day
again--a
decent,
ordinary
citizen.
The
silent
common,
the
impulse
of
my
flight,
the
starting
flames,
were
as
if
they
had
been
in
a
dream.
I
asked
myself
had
these
latter
things
indeed
happened?
I
could
not
credit
it.
I
rose
and
walked
unsteadily
up
the
steep
incline
of
the
bridge.
My
mind
was
blank
wonder.
My
muscles
and
nerves
seemed
drained
of
their
strength.
I
dare
say
I
staggered
drunkenly.
A
head
rose
over
the
arch,
and
the
figure
of
a
workman
carrying
a
basket
appeared.
Beside
him
ran
a
little
boy.
He
passed
me,
wishing
me
good
night.
I
was
minded
to
speak
to
him,
but
did
not.
I
answered
his
greeting
with
a
meaningless
mumble
and
went
on
over
the
bridge.
Over
the
Maybury
arch
a
train,
a
billowing
tumult
of
white,
firelit
smoke,
and
a
long
caterpillar
of
lighted
windows,
went
flying
south--clatter,
clatter,
clap,
rap,
and
it
had
gone.
A
dim
group
of
people
talked
in
the
gate
of
one
of
the
houses
in
the
pretty
little
row
of
gables
that
was
called
Oriental
Terrace.
It
was
all
so
real
and
so
familiar.
And
that
behind
me!
It
was
frantic,
fantastic!
Such
things,
I
told
myself,
could
not
be.
Perhaps
I
am
a
man
of
exceptional
moods.
I
do
not
know
how
far
my
experience
is
common.
At
times
I
suffer
from
the
strangest
sense
of
detachment
from
myself
and
the
world
about
me;
I
seem
to
watch
it
all
from
the
outside,
from
somewhere
inconceivably
remote,
out
of
time,
out
of
space,
out
of
the
stress
and
tragedy
of
it
all.
This
feeling
was
very
strong
upon
me
that
night.
Here
was
another
side
to
my
dream.
But
the
trouble
was
the
blank
incongruity
of
this
serenity
and
the
swift
death
flying
yonder,
not
two
miles
away.
There
was
a
noise
of
business
from
the
gasworks,
and
the
electric
lamps
were
all
alight.
I
stopped
at
the
group
of
people.
"What
news
from
the
common?"
said
I.
There
were
two
men
and
a
woman
at
the
gate.
"Eh?"
said
one
of
the
men,
turning.
"What
news
from
the
common?"
I
said.
"'Ain't
yer
just
_been_
there?"
asked
the
men.
"People
seem
fair
silly
about
the
common,"
said
the
woman
over
the
gate.
"What's
it
all
abart?"
"Haven't
you
heard
of
the
men
from
Mars?"
said
I;
"the
creatures
from
Mars?"
"Quite
enough,"
said
the
woman
over
the
gate.
"Thenks";
and
all
three
of
them
laughed.
I
felt
foolish
and
angry.
I
tried
and
found
I
could
not
tell
them
what
I
had
seen.
They
laughed
again
at
my
broken
sentences.
"You'll
hear
more
yet,"
I
said,
and
went
on
to
my
home.
I
startled
my
wife
at
the
doorway,
so
haggard
was
I.
I
went
into
the
dining
room,
sat
down,
drank
some
wine,
and
so
soon
as
I
could
collect
myself
sufficiently
I
told
her
the
things
I
had
seen.
The
dinner,
which
was
a
cold
one,
had
already
been
served,
and
remained
neglected
on
the
table
while
I
told
my
story.
"There
is
one
thing,"
I
said,
to
allay
the
fears
I
had
aroused;
"they
are
the
most
sluggish
things
I
ever
saw
crawl.
They
may
keep
the
pit
and
kill
people
who
come
near
them,
but
they
cannot
get
out
of
it.
.
.
.
But
the
horror
of
them!"
"Don't,
dear!"
said
my
wife,
knitting
her
brows
and
putting
her
hand
on
mine.
"Poor
Ogilvy!"
I
said.
"To
think
he
may
be
lying
dead
there!"
My
wife
at
least
did
not
find
my
experience
incredible.
When
I
saw
how
deadly
white
her
face
was,
I
ceased
abruptly.
"They
may
come
here,"
she
said
again
and
again.
I
pressed
her
to
take
wine,
and
tried
to
reassure
her.
"They
can
scarcely
move,"
I
said.
I
began
to
comfort
her
and
myself
by
repeating
all
that
Ogilvy
had
told
me
of
the
impossibility
of
the
Martians
establishing
themselves
on
the
earth.
In
particular
I
laid
stress
on
the
gravitational
difficulty.
On
the
surface
of
the
earth
the
force
of
gravity
is
three
times
what
it
is
on
the
surface
of
Mars.
A
Martian,
therefore,
would
weigh
three
times
more
than
on
Mars,
albeit
his
muscular
strength
would
be
the
same.
His
own
body
would
be
a
cope
of
lead
to
him.
That,
indeed,
was
the
general
opinion.
Both
_The
Times_
and
the
_Daily
Telegraph_,
for
instance,
insisted
on
it
the
next
morning,
and
both
overlooked,
just
as
I
did,
two
obvious
modifying
influences.
The
atmosphere
of
the
earth,
we
now
know,
contains
far
more
oxygen
or
far
less
argon
(whichever
way
one
likes
to
put
it)
than
does
Mars.
The
invigorating
influences
of
this
excess
of
oxygen
upon
the
Martians
indisputably
did
much
to
counterbalance
the
increased
weight
of
their
bodies.
And,
in
the
second
place,
we
all
overlooked
the
fact
that
such
mechanical
intelligence
as
the
Martian
possessed
was
quite
able
to
dispense
with
muscular
exertion
at
a
pinch.
But
I
did
not
consider
these
points
at
the
time,
and
so
my
reasoning
was
dead
against
the
chances
of
the
invaders.
With
wine
and
food,
the
confidence
of
my
own
table,
and
the
necessity
of
reassuring
my
wife,
I
grew
by
insensible
degrees
courageous
and
secure.
"They
have
done
a
foolish
thing,"
said
I,
fingering
my
wineglass.
"They
are
dangerous
because,
no
doubt,
they
are
mad
with
terror.
Perhaps
they
expected
to
find
no
living
things--certainly
no
intelligent
living
things."
"A
shell
in
the
pit"
said
I,
"if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
will
kill
them
all."
The
intense
excitement
of
the
events
had
no
doubt
left
my
perceptive
powers
in
a
state
of
erethism.
I
remember
that
dinner
table
with
extraordinary
vividness
even
now.
My
dear
wife's
sweet
anxious
face
peering
at
me
from
under
the
pink
lamp
shade,
the
white
cloth
with
its
silver
and
glass
table
furniture--for
in
those
days
even
philosophical
writers
had
many
little
luxuries--the
crimson-purple
wine
in
my
glass,
are
photographically
distinct.
At
the
end
of
it
I
sat,
tempering
nuts
with
a
cigarette,
regretting
Ogilvy's
rashness,
and
denouncing
the
shortsighted
timidity
of
the
Martians.
So
some
respectable
dodo
in
the
Mauritius
might
have
lorded
it
in
his
nest,
and
discussed
the
arrival
of
that
shipful
of
pitiless
sailors
in
want
of
animal
food.
"We
will
peck
them
to
death
tomorrow,
my
dear."
I
did
not
know
it,
but
that
was
the
last
civilised
dinner
I
was
to
eat
for
very
many
strange
and
terrible
days.
CHAPTER
EIGHT
FRIDAY
NIGHT
The
most
extraordinary
thing
to
my
mind,
of
all
the
strange
and
wonderful
things
that
happened
upon
that
Friday,
was
the
dovetailing
of
the
commonplace
habits
of
our
social
order
with
the
first
beginnings
of
the
series
of
events
that
was
to
topple
that
social
order
headlong.
If
on
Friday
night
you
had
taken
a
pair
of
compasses
and
drawn
a
circle
with
a
radius
of
five
miles
round
the
Woking
sand
pits,
I
doubt
if
you
would
have
had
one
human
being
outside
it,
unless
it
were
some
relation
of
Stent
or
of
the
three
or
four
cyclists
or
London
people
lying
dead
on
the
common,
whose
emotions
or
habits
were
at
all
affected
by
the
new-comers.
Many
people
had
heard
of
the
cylinder,
of
course,
and
talked
about
it
in
their
leisure,
but
it
certainly
did
not
make
the
sensation
that
an
ultimatum
to
Germany
would
have
done.
In
London
that
night
poor
Henderson's
telegram
describing
the
gradual
unscrewing
of
the
shot
was
judged
to
be
a
canard,
and
his
evening
paper,
after
wiring
for
authentication
from
him
and
receiving
no
reply--the
man
was
killed--decided
not
to
print
a
special
edition.
Even
within
the
five-mile
circle
the
great
majority
of
people
were
inert.
I
have
already
described
the
behaviour
of
the
men
and
women
to
whom
I
spoke.
All
over
the
district
people
were
dining
and
supping;
working
men
were
gardening
after
the
labours
of
the
day,
children
were
being
put
to
bed,
young
people
were
wandering
through
the
lanes
love-making,
students
sat
over
their
books.
Maybe
there
was
a
murmur
in
the
village
streets,
a
novel
and
dominant
topic
in
the
public-houses,
and
here
and
there
a
messenger,
or
even
an
eye-witness
of
the
later
occurrences,
caused
a
whirl
of
excitement,
a
shouting,
and
a
running
to
and
fro;
but
for
the
most
part
the
daily
routine
of
working,
eating,
drinking,
sleeping,
went
on
as
it
had
done
for
countless
years--as
though
no
planet
Mars
existed
in
the
sky.
Even
at
Woking
station
and
Horsell
and
Chobham
that
was
the
case.
In
Woking
junction,
until
a
late
hour,
trains
were
stopping
and
going
on,
others
were
shunting
on
the
sidings,
passengers
were
alighting
and
waiting,
and
everything
was
proceeding
in
the
most
ordinary
way.
A
boy
from
the
town,
trenching
on
Smith's
monopoly,
was
selling
papers
with
the
afternoon's
news.
The
ringing
impact
of
trucks,
the
sharp
whistle
of
the
engines
from
the
junction,
mingled
with
their
shouts
of
"Men
from
Mars!"
Excited
men
came
into
the
station
about
nine
o'clock
with
incredible
tidings,
and
caused
no
more
disturbance
than
drunkards
might
have
done.
People
rattling
Londonwards
peered
into
the
darkness
outside
the
carriage
windows,
and
saw
only
a
rare,
flickering,
vanishing
spark
dance
up
from
the
direction
of
Horsell,
a
red
glow
and
a
thin
veil
of
smoke
driving
across
the
stars,
and
thought
that
nothing
more
serious
than
a
heath
fire
was
happening.
It
was
only
round
the
edge
of
the
common
that
any
disturbance
was
perceptible.
There
were
half
a
dozen
villas
burning
on
the
Woking
border.
There
were
lights
in
all
the
houses
on
the
common
side
of
the
three
villages,
and
the
people
there
kept
awake
till
dawn.
A
curious
crowd
lingered
restlessly,
people
coming
and
going
but
the
crowd
remaining,
both
on
the
Chobham
and
Horsell
bridges.
One
or
two
adventurous
souls,
it
was
afterwards
found,
went
into
the
darkness
and
crawled
quite
near
the
Martians;
but
they
never
returned,
for
now
and
again
a
light-ray,
like
the
beam
of
a
warship's
searchlight
swept
the
common,
and
the
Heat-Ray
was
ready
to
follow.
Save
for
such,
that
big
area
of
common
was
silent
and
desolate,
and
the
charred
bodies
lay
about
on
it
all
night
under
the
stars,
and
all
the
next
day.
A
noise
of
hammering
from
the
pit
was
heard
by
many
people.
So
you
have
the
state
of
things
on
Friday
night.
In
the
centre,
sticking
into
the
skin
of
our
old
planet
Earth
like
a
poisoned
dart,
was
this
cylinder.
But
the
poison
was
scarcely
working
yet.
Around
it
was
a
patch
of
silent
common,
smouldering
in
places,
and
with
a
few
dark,
dimly
seen
objects
lying
in
contorted
attitudes
here
and
there.
Here
and
there
was
a
burning
bush
or
tree.
Beyond
was
a
fringe
of
excitement,
and
farther
than
that
fringe
the
inflammation
had
not
crept
as
yet.
In
the
rest
of
the
world
the
stream
of
life
still
flowed
as
it
had
flowed
for
immemorial
years.
The
fever
of
war
that
would
presently
clog
vein
and
artery,
deaden
nerve
and
destroy
brain,
had
still
to
develop.
All
night
long
the
Martians
were
hammering
and
stirring,
sleepless,
indefatigable,
at
work
upon
the
machines
they
were
making
ready,
and
ever
and
again
a
puff
of
greenish-white
smoke
whirled
up
to
the
starlit
sky.
About
eleven
a
company
of
soldiers
came
through
Horsell,
and
deployed
along
the
edge
of
the
common
to
form
a
cordon.
Later
a
second
company
marched
through
Chobham
to
deploy
on
the
north
side
of
the
common.
Several
officers
from
the
Inkerman
barracks
had
been
on
the
common
earlier
in
the
day,
and
one,
Major
Eden,
was
reported
to
be
missing.
The
colonel
of
the
regiment
came
to
the
Chobham
bridge
and
was
busy
questioning
the
crowd
at
midnight.
The
military
authorities
were
certainly
alive
to
the
seriousness
of
the
business.
About
eleven,
the
next
morning's
papers
were
able
to
say,
a
squadron
of
hussars,
two
Maxims,
and
about
four
hundred
men
of
the
Cardigan
regiment
started
from
Aldershot.
A
few
seconds
after
midnight
the
crowd
in
the
Chertsey
road,
Woking,
saw
a
star
fall
from
heaven
into
the
pine
woods
to
the
northwest.
It
had
a
greenish
colour,
and
caused
a
silent
brightness
like
summer
lightning.
This
was
the
second
cylinder.
CHAPTER
NINE
THE
FIGHTING
BEGINS
Saturday
lives
in
my
memory
as
a
day
of
suspense.
It
was
a
day
of
lassitude
too,
hot
and
close,
with,
I
am
told,
a
rapidly
fluctuating
barometer.
I
had
slept
but
little,
though
my
wife
had
succeeded
in
sleeping,
and
I
rose
early.
I
went
into
my
garden
before
breakfast
and
stood
listening,
but
towards
the
common
there
was
nothing
stirring
but
a
lark.
The
milkman
came
as
usual.
I
heard
the
rattle
of
his
chariot
and
I
went
round
to
the
side
gate
to
ask
the
latest
news.
He
told
me
that
during
the
night
the
Martians
had
been
surrounded
by
troops,
and
that
guns
were
expected.
Then--a
familiar,
reassuring
note--I
heard
a
train
running
towards
Woking.
"They
aren't
to
be
killed,"
said
the
milkman,
"if
that
can
possibly
be
avoided."
I
saw
my
neighbour
gardening,
chatted
with
him
for
a
time,
and
then
strolled
in
to
breakfast.
It
was
a
most
unexceptional
morning.
My
neighbour
was
of
opinion
that
the
troops
would
be
able
to
capture
or
to
destroy
the
Martians
during
the
day.
"It's
a
pity
they
make
themselves
so
unapproachable,"
he
said.
"It
would
be
curious
to
know
how
they
live
on
another
planet;
we
might
learn
a
thing
or
two."
He
came
up
to
the
fence
and
extended
a
handful
of
strawberries,
for
his
gardening
was
as
generous
as
it
was
enthusiastic.
At
the
same
time
he
told
me
of
the
burning
of
the
pine
woods
about
the
Byfleet
Golf
Links.
"They
say,"
said
he,
"that
there's
another
of
those
blessed
things
fallen
there--number
two.
But
one's
enough,
surely.
This
lot'll
cost
the
insurance
people
a
pretty
penny
before
everything's
settled."
He
laughed
with
an
air
of
the
greatest
good
humour
as
he
said
this.
The
woods,
he
said,
were
still
burning,
and
pointed
out
a
haze
of
smoke
to
me.
"They
will
be
hot
under
foot
for
days,
on
account
of
the
thick
soil
of
pine
needles
and
turf,"
he
said,
and
then
grew
serious
over
"poor
Ogilvy."
After
breakfast,
instead
of
working,
I
decided
to
walk
down
towards
the
common.
Under
the
railway
bridge
I
found
a
group
of
soldiers--sappers,
I
think,
men
in
small
round
caps,
dirty
red
jackets
unbuttoned,
and
showing
their
blue
shirts,
dark
trousers,
and
boots
coming
to
the
calf.
They
told
me
no
one
was
allowed
over
the
canal,
and,
looking
along
the
road
towards
the
bridge,
I
saw
one
of
the
Cardigan
men
standing
sentinel
there.
I
talked
with
these
soldiers
for
a
time;
I
told
them
of
my
sight
of
the
Martians
on
the
previous
evening.
None
of
them
had
seen
the
Martians,
and
they
had
but
the
vaguest
ideas
of
them,
so
that
they
plied
me
with
questions.
They
said
that
they
did
not
know
who
had
authorised
the
movements
of
the
troops;
their
idea
was
that
a
dispute
had
arisen
at
the
Horse
Guards.
The
ordinary
sapper
is
a
great
deal
better
educated
than
the
common
soldier,
and
they
discussed
the
peculiar
conditions
of
the
possible
fight
with
some
acuteness.
I
described
the
Heat-Ray
to
them,
and
they
began
to
argue
among
themselves.
"Crawl
up
under
cover
and
rush
'em,
say
I,"
said
one.
"Get
aht!"
said
another.
"What's
cover
against
this
'ere
'eat?
Sticks
to
cook
yer!
What
we
got
to
do
is
to
go
as
near
as
the
ground'll
let
us,
and
then
drive
a
trench."
"Blow
yer
trenches!
You
always
want
trenches;
you
ought
to
ha'
been
born
a
rabbit
Snippy."
"Ain't
they
got
any
necks,
then?"
said
a
third,
abruptly--a
little,
contemplative,
dark
man,
smoking
a
pipe.
I
repeated
my
description.
"Octopuses,"
said
he,
"that's
what
I
calls
'em.
Talk
about
fishers
of
men--fighters
of
fish
it
is
this
time!"
"It
ain't
no
murder
killing
beasts
like
that,"
said
the
first
speaker.
"Why
not
shell
the
darned
things
strite
off
and
finish
'em?"
said
the
little
dark
man.
"You
carn
tell
what
they
might
do."
"Where's
your
shells?"
said
the
first
speaker.
"There
ain't
no
time.
Do
it
in
a
rush,
that's
my
tip,
and
do
it
at
once."
So
they
discussed
it.
After
a
while
I
left
them,
and
went
on
to
the
railway
station
to
get
as
many
morning
papers
as
I
could.
But
I
will
not
weary
the
reader
with
a
description
of
that
long
morning
and
of
the
longer
afternoon.
I
did
not
succeed
in
getting
a
glimpse
of
the
common,
for
even
Horsell
and
Chobham
church
towers
were
in
the
hands
of
the
military
authorities.
The
soldiers
I
addressed
didn't
know
anything;
the
officers
were
mysterious
as
well
as
busy.
I
found
people
in
the
town
quite
secure
again
in
the
presence
of
the
military,
and
I
heard
for
the
first
time
from
Marshall,
the
tobacconist,
that
his
son
was
among
the
dead
on
the
common.
The
soldiers
had
made
the
people
on
the
outskirts
of
Horsell
lock
up
and
leave
their
houses.
I
got
back
to
lunch
about
two,
very
tired
for,
as
I
have
said,
the
day
was
extremely
hot
and
dull;
and
in
order
to
refresh
myself
I
took
a
cold
bath
in
the
afternoon.
About
half
past
four
I
went
up
to
the
railway
station
to
get
an
evening
paper,
for
the
morning
papers
had
contained
only
a
very
inaccurate
description
of
the
killing
of
Stent,
Henderson,
Ogilvy,
and
the
others.
But
there
was
little
I
didn't
know.
The
Martians
did
not
show
an
inch
of
themselves.
They
seemed
busy
in
their
pit,
and
there
was
a
sound
of
hammering
and
an
almost
continuous
streamer
of
smoke.
Apparently
they
were
busy
getting
ready
for
a
struggle.
"Fresh
attempts
have
been
made
to
signal,
but
without
success,"
was
the
stereotyped
formula
of
the
papers.
A
sapper
told
me
it
was
done
by
a
man
in
a
ditch
with
a
flag
on
a
long
pole.
The
Martians
took
as
much
notice
of
such
advances
as
we
should
of
the
lowing
of
a
cow.
I
must
confess
the
sight
of
all
this
armament,
all
this
preparation,
greatly
excited
me.
My
imagination
became
belligerent,
and
defeated
the
invaders
in
a
dozen
striking
ways;
something
of
my
schoolboy
dreams
of
battle
and
heroism
came
back.
It
hardly
seemed
a
fair
fight
to
me
at
that
time.
They
seemed
very
helpless
in
that
pit
of
theirs.
About
three
o'clock
there
began
the
thud
of
a
gun
at
measured
intervals
from
Chertsey
or
Addlestone.
I
learned
that
the
smouldering
pine
wood
into
which
the
second
cylinder
had
fallen
was
being
shelled,
in
the
hope
of
destroying
that
object
before
it
opened.
It
was
only
about
five,
however,
that
a
field
gun
reached
Chobham
for
use
against
the
first
body
of
Martians.
About
six
in
the
evening,
as
I
sat
at
tea
with
my
wife
in
the
summerhouse
talking
vigorously
about
the
battle
that
was
lowering
upon
us,
I
heard
a
muffled
detonation
from
the
common,
and
immediately
after
a
gust
of
firing.
Close
on
the
heels
of
that
came
a
violent
rattling
crash,
quite
close
to
us,
that
shook
the
ground;
and,
starting
out
upon
the
lawn,
I
saw
the
tops
of
the
trees
about
the
Oriental
College
burst
into
smoky
red
flame,
and
the
tower
of
the
little
church
beside
it
slide
down
into
ruin.
The
pinnacle
of
the
mosque
had
vanished,
and
the
roof
line
of
the
college
itself
looked
as
if
a
hundred-ton
gun
had
been
at
work
upon
it.
One
of
our
chimneys
cracked
as
if
a
shot
had
hit
it,
flew,
and
a
piece
of
it
came
clattering
down
the
tiles
and
made
a
heap
of
broken
red
fragments
upon
the
flower
bed
by
my
study
window.
I
and
my
wife
stood
amazed.
Then
I
realised
that
the
crest
of
Maybury
Hill
must
be
within
range
of
the
Martians'
Heat-Ray
now
that
the
college
was
cleared
out
of
the
way.
At
that
I
gripped
my
wife's
arm,
and
without
ceremony
ran
her
out
into
the
road.
Then
I
fetched
out
the
servant,
telling
her
I
would
go
upstairs
myself
for
the
box
she
was
clamouring
for.
"We
can't
possibly
stay
here,"
I
said;
and
as
I
spoke
the
firing
reopened
for
a
moment
upon
the
common.
"But
where
are
we
to
go?"
said
my
wife
in
terror.
I
thought
perplexed.
Then
I
remembered
her
cousins
at
Leatherhead.
"Leatherhead!"
I
shouted
above
the
sudden
noise.
She
looked
away
from
me
downhill.
The
people
were
coming
out
of
their
houses,
astonished.
"How
are
we
to
get
to
Leatherhead?"
she
said.
Down
the
hill
I
saw
a
bevy
of
hussars
ride
under
the
railway
bridge;
three
galloped
through
the
open
gates
of
the
Oriental
College;
two
others
dismounted,
and
began
running
from
house
to
house.
The
sun,
shining
through
the
smoke
that
drove
up
from
the
tops
of
the
trees,
seemed
blood
red,
and
threw
an
unfamiliar
lurid
light
upon
everything.
"Stop
here,"
said
I;
"you
are
safe
here";
and
I
started
off
at
once
for
the
Spotted
Dog,
for
I
knew
the
landlord
had
a
horse
and
dog
cart.
I
ran,
for
I
perceived
that
in
a
moment
everyone
upon
this
side
of
the
hill
would
be
moving.
I
found
him
in
his
bar,
quite
unaware
of
what
was
going
on
behind
his
house.
A
man
stood
with
his
back
to
me,
talking
to
him.
"I
must
have
a
pound,"
said
the
landlord,
"and
I've
no
one
to
drive
it."
"I'll
give
you
two,"
said
I,
over
the
stranger's
shoulder.
"What
for?"
"And
I'll
bring
it
back
by
midnight,"
I
said.
"Lord!"
said
the
landlord;
"what's
the
hurry?
I'm
selling
my
bit
of
a
pig.
Two
pounds,
and
you
bring
it
back?
What's
going
on
now?"
I
explained
hastily
that
I
had
to
leave
my
home,
and
so
secured
the
dog
cart.
At
the
time
it
did
not
seem
to
me
nearly
so
urgent
that
the
landlord
should
leave
his.
I
took
care
to
have
the
cart
there
and
then,
drove
it
off
down
the
road,
and,
leaving
it
in
charge
of
my
wife
and
servant,
rushed
into
my
house
and
packed
a
few
valuables,
such
plate
as
we
had,
and
so
forth.
The
beech
trees
below
the
house
were
burning
while
I
did
this,
and
the
palings
up
the
road
glowed
red.
While
I
was
occupied
in
this
way,
one
of
the
dismounted
hussars
came
running
up.
He
was
going
from
house
to
house,
warning
people
to
leave.
He
was
going
on
as
I
came
out
of
my
front
door,
lugging
my
treasures,
done
up
in
a
tablecloth.
I
shouted
after
him:
"What
news?"
He
turned,
stared,
bawled
something
about
"crawling
out
in
a
thing
like
a
dish
cover,"
and
ran
on
to
the
gate
of
the
house
at
the
crest.
A
sudden
whirl
of
black
smoke
driving
across
the
road
hid
him
for
a
moment.
I
ran
to
my
neighbour's
door
and
rapped
to
satisfy
myself
of
what
I
already
knew,
that
his
wife
had
gone
to
London
with
him
and
had
locked
up
their
house.
I
went
in
again,
according
to
my
promise,
to
get
my
servant's
box,
lugged
it
out,
clapped
it
beside
her
on
the
tail
of
the
dog
cart,
and
then
caught
the
reins
and
jumped
up
into
the
driver's
seat
beside
my
wife.
In
another
moment
we
were
clear
of
the
smoke
and
noise,
and
spanking
down
the
opposite
slope
of
Maybury
Hill
towards
Old
Woking.
In
front
was
a
quiet
sunny
landscape,
a
wheat
field
ahead
on
either
side
of
the
road,
and
the
Maybury
Inn
with
its
swinging
sign.
I
saw
the
doctor's
cart
ahead
of
me.
At
the
bottom
of
the
hill
I
turned
my
head
to
look
at
the
hillside
I
was
leaving.
Thick
streamers
of
black
smoke
shot
with
threads
of
red
fire
were
driving
up
into
the
still
air,
and
throwing
dark
shadows
upon
the
green
treetops
eastward.
The
smoke
already
extended
far
away
to
the
east
and
west--to
the
Byfleet
pine
woods
eastward,
and
to
Woking
on
the
west.
The
road
was
dotted
with
people
running
towards
us.
And
very
faint
now,
but
very
distinct
through
the
hot,
quiet
air,
one
heard
the
whirr
of
a
machine-gun
that
was
presently
stilled,
and
an
intermittent
cracking
of
rifles.
Apparently
the
Martians
were
setting
fire
to
everything
within
range
of
their
Heat-Ray.
I
am
not
an
expert
driver,
and
I
had
immediately
to
turn
my
attention
to
the
horse.
When
I
looked
back
again
the
second
hill
had
hidden
the
black
smoke.
I
slashed
the
horse
with
the
whip,
and
gave
him
a
loose
rein
until
Woking
and
Send
lay
between
us
and
that
quivering
tumult.
I
overtook
and
passed
the
doctor
between
Woking
and
Send.
CHAPTER
TEN
IN
THE
STORM
Leatherhead
is
about
twelve
miles
from
Maybury
Hill.
The
scent
of
hay
was
in
the
air
through
the
lush
meadows
beyond
Pyrford,
and
the
hedges
on
either
side
were
sweet
and
gay
with
multitudes
of
dog-roses.
The
heavy
firing
that
had
broken
out
while
we
were
driving
down
Maybury
Hill
ceased
as
abruptly
as
it
began,
leaving
the
evening
very
peaceful
and
still.
We
got
to
Leatherhead
without
misadventure
about
nine
o'clock,
and
the
horse
had
an
hour's
rest
while
I
took
supper
with
my
cousins
and
commended
my
wife
to
their
care.
My
wife
was
curiously
silent
throughout
the
drive,
and
seemed
oppressed
with
forebodings
of
evil.
I
talked
to
her
reassuringly,
pointing
out
that
the
Martians
were
tied
to
the
Pit
by
sheer
heaviness,
and
at
the
utmost
could
but
crawl
a
little
out
of
it;
but
she
answered
only
in
monosyllables.
Had
it
not
been
for
my
promise
to
the
innkeeper,
she
would,
I
think,
have
urged
me
to
stay
in
Leatherhead
that
night.
Would
that
I
had!
Her
face,
I
remember,
was
very
white
as
we
parted.
For
my
own
part,
I
had
been
feverishly
excited
all
day.
Something
very
like
the
war
fever
that
occasionally
runs
through
a
civilised
community
had
got
into
my
blood,
and
in
my
heart
I
was
not
so
very
sorry
that
I
had
to
return
to
Maybury
that
night.
I
was
even
afraid
that
that
last
fusillade
I
had
heard
might
mean
the
extermination
of
our
invaders
from
Mars.
I
can
best
express
my
state
of
mind
by
saying
that
I
wanted
to
be
in
at
the
death.
It
was
nearly
eleven
when
I
started
to
return.
The
night
was
unexpectedly
dark;
to
me,
walking
out
of
the
lighted
passage
of
my
cousins'
house,
it
seemed
indeed
black,
and
it
was
as
hot
and
close
as
the
day.
Overhead
the
clouds
were
driving
fast,
albeit
not
a
breath
stirred
the
shrubs
about
us.
My
cousins'
man
lit
both
lamps.
Happily,
I
knew
the
road
intimately.
My
wife
stood
in
the
light
of
the
doorway,
and
watched
me
until
I
jumped
up
into
the
dog
cart.
Then
abruptly
she
turned
and
went
in,
leaving
my
cousins
side
by
side
wishing
me
good
hap.
I
was
a
little
depressed
at
first
with
the
contagion
of
my
wife's
fears,
but
very
soon
my
thoughts
reverted
to
the
Martians.
At
that
time
I
was
absolutely
in
the
dark
as
to
the
course
of
the
evening's
fighting.
I
did
not
know
even
the
circumstances
that
had
precipitated
the
conflict.
As
I
came
through
Ockham
(for
that
was
the
way
I
returned,
and
not
through
Send
and
Old
Woking)
I
saw
along
the
western
horizon
a
blood-red
glow,
which
as
I
drew
nearer,
crept
slowly
up
the
sky.
The
driving
clouds
of
the
gathering
thunderstorm
mingled
there
with
masses
of
black
and
red
smoke.
Ripley
Street
was
deserted,
and
except
for
a
lighted
window
or
so
the
village
showed
not
a
sign
of
life;
but
I
narrowly
escaped
an
accident
at
the
corner
of
the
road
to
Pyrford,
where
a
knot
of
people
stood
with
their
backs
to
me.
They
said
nothing
to
me
as
I
passed.
I
do
not
know
what
they
knew
of
the
things
happening
beyond
the
hill,
nor
do
I
know
if
the
silent
houses
I
passed
on
my
way
were
sleeping
securely,
or
deserted
and
empty,
or
harassed
and
watching
against
the
terror
of
the
night.
From
Ripley
until
I
came
through
Pyrford
I
was
in
the
valley
of
the
Wey,
and
the
red
glare
was
hidden
from
me.
As
I
ascended
the
little
hill
beyond
Pyrford
Church
the
glare
came
into
view
again,
and
the
trees
about
me
shivered
with
the
first
intimation
of
the
storm
that
was
upon
me.
Then
I
heard
midnight
pealing
out
from
Pyrford
Church
behind
me,
and
then
came
the
silhouette
of
Maybury
Hill,
with
its
tree-tops
and
roofs
black
and
sharp
against
the
red.
Even
as
I
beheld
this
a
lurid
green
glare
lit
the
road
about
me
and
showed
the
distant
woods
towards
Addlestone.
I
felt
a
tug
at
the
reins.
I
saw
that
the
driving
clouds
had
been
pierced
as
it
were
by
a
thread
of
green
fire,
suddenly
lighting
their
confusion
and
falling
into
the
field
to
my
left.
It
was
the
third
falling
star!
Close
on
its
apparition,
and
blindingly
violet
by
contrast,
danced
out
the
first
lightning
of
the
gathering
storm,
and
the
thunder
burst
like
a
rocket
overhead.
The
horse
took
the
bit
between
his
teeth
and
bolted.
A
moderate
incline
runs
towards
the
foot
of
Maybury
Hill,
and
down
this
we
clattered.
Once
the
lightning
had
begun,
it
went
on
in
as
rapid
a
succession
of
flashes
as
I
have
ever
seen.
The
thunderclaps,
treading
one
on
the
heels
of
another
and
with
a
strange
crackling
accompaniment,
sounded
more
like
the
working
of
a
gigantic
electric
machine
than
the
usual
detonating
reverberations.
The
flickering
light
was
blinding
and
confusing,
and
a
thin
hail
smote
gustily
at
my
face
as
I
drove
down
the
slope.
At
first
I
regarded
little
but
the
road
before
me,
and
then
abruptly
my
attention
was
arrested
by
something
that
was
moving
rapidly
down
the
opposite
slope
of
Maybury
Hill.
At
first
I
took
it
for
the
wet
roof
of
a
house,
but
one
flash
following
another
showed
it
to
be
in
swift
rolling
movement.
It
was
an
elusive
vision--a
moment
of
bewildering
darkness,
and
then,
in
a
flash
like
daylight,
the
red
masses
of
the
Orphanage
near
the
crest
of
the
hill,
the
green
tops
of
the
pine
trees,
and
this
problematical
object
came
out
clear
and
sharp
and
bright.
And
this
Thing
I
saw!
How
can
I
describe
it?
A
monstrous
tripod,
higher
than
many
houses,
striding
over
the
young
pine
trees,
and
smashing
them
aside
in
its
career;
a
walking
engine
of
glittering
metal,
striding
now
across
the
heather;
articulate
ropes
of
steel
dangling
from
it,
and
the
clattering
tumult
of
its
passage
mingling
with
the
riot
of
the
thunder.
A
flash,
and
it
came
out
vividly,
heeling
over
one
way
with
two
feet
in
the
air,
to
vanish
and
reappear
almost
instantly
as
it
seemed,
with
the
next
flash,
a
hundred
yards
nearer.
Can
you
imagine
a
milking
stool
tilted
and
bowled
violently
along
the
ground?
That
was
the
impression
those
instant
flashes
gave.
But
instead
of
a
milking
stool
imagine
it
a
great
body
of
machinery
on
a
tripod
stand.
Then
suddenly
the
trees
in
the
pine
wood
ahead
of
me
were
parted,
as
brittle
reeds
are
parted
by
a
man
thrusting
through
them;
they
were
snapped
off
and
driven
headlong,
and
a
second
huge
tripod
appeared,
rushing,
as
it
seemed,
headlong
towards
me.
And
I
was
galloping
hard
to
meet
it!
At
the
sight
of
the
second
monster
my
nerve
went
altogether.
Not
stopping
to
look
again,
I
wrenched
the
horse's
head
hard
round
to
the
right
and
in
another
moment
the
dog
cart
had
heeled
over
upon
the
horse;
the
shafts
smashed
noisily,
and
I
was
flung
sideways
and
fell
heavily
into
a
shallow
pool
of
water.
I
crawled
out
almost
immediately,
and
crouched,
my
feet
still
in
the
water,
under
a
clump
of
furze.
The
horse
lay
motionless
(his
neck
was
broken,
poor
brute!)
and
by
the
lightning
flashes
I
saw
the
black
bulk
of
the
overturned
dog
cart
and
the
silhouette
of
the
wheel
still
spinning
slowly.
In
another
moment
the
colossal
mechanism
went
striding
by
me,
and
passed
uphill
towards
Pyrford.
Seen
nearer,
the
Thing
was
incredibly
strange,
for
it
was
no
mere
insensate
machine
driving
on
its
way.
Machine
it
was,
with
a
ringing
metallic
pace,
and
long,
flexible,
glittering
tentacles
(one
of
which
gripped
a
young
pine
tree)
swinging
and
rattling
about
its
strange
body.
It
picked
its
road
as
it
went
striding
along,
and
the
brazen
hood
that
surmounted
it
moved
to
and
fro
with
the
inevitable
suggestion
of
a
head
looking
about.
Behind
the
main
body
was
a
huge
mass
of
white
metal
like
a
gigantic
fisherman's
basket,
and
puffs
of
green
smoke
squirted
out
from
the
joints
of
the
limbs
as
the
monster
swept
by
me.
And
in
an
instant
it
was
gone.
So
much
I
saw
then,
all
vaguely
for
the
flickering
of
the
lightning,
in
blinding
highlights
and
dense
black
shadows.
As
it
passed
it
set
up
an
exultant
deafening
howl
that
drowned
the
thunder--"Aloo!
Aloo!"--and
in
another
minute
it
was
with
its
companion,
half
a
mile
away,
stooping
over
something
in
the
field.
I
have
no
doubt
this
Thing
in
the
field
was
the
third
of
the
ten
cylinders
they
had
fired
at
us
from
Mars.
For
some
minutes
I
lay
there
in
the
rain
and
darkness
watching,
by
the
intermittent
light,
these
monstrous
beings
of
metal
moving
about
in
the
distance
over
the
hedge
tops.
A
thin
hail
was
now
beginning,
and
as
it
came
and
went
their
figures
grew
misty
and
then
flashed
into
clearness
again.
Now
and
then
came
a
gap
in
the
lightning,
and
the
night
swallowed
them
up.
I
was
soaked
with
hail
above
and
puddle
water
below.
It
was
some
time
before
my
blank
astonishment
would
let
me
struggle
up
the
bank
to
a
drier
position,
or
think
at
all
of
my
imminent
peril.
Not
far
from
me
was
a
little
one-roomed
squatter's
hut
of
wood,
surrounded
by
a
patch
of
potato
garden.
I
struggled
to
my
feet
at
last,
and,
crouching
and
making
use
of
every
chance
of
cover,
I
made
a
run
for
this.
I
hammered
at
the
door,
but
I
could
not
make
the
people
hear
(if
there
were
any
people
inside),
and
after
a
time
I
desisted,
and,
availing
myself
of
a
ditch
for
the
greater
part
of
the
way,
succeeded
in
crawling,
unobserved
by
these
monstrous
machines,
into
the
pine
woods
towards
Maybury.
Under
cover
of
this
I
pushed
on,
wet
and
shivering
now,
towards
my
own
house.
I
walked
among
the
trees
trying
to
find
the
footpath.
It
was
very
dark
indeed
in
the
wood,
for
the
lightning
was
now
becoming
infrequent,
and
the
hail,
which
was
pouring
down
in
a
torrent,
fell
in
columns
through
the
gaps
in
the
heavy
foliage.
If
I
had
fully
realised
the
meaning
of
all
the
things
I
had
seen
I
should
have
immediately
worked
my
way
round
through
Byfleet
to
Street
Cobham,
and
so
gone
back
to
rejoin
my
wife
at
Leatherhead.
But
that
night
the
strangeness
of
things
about
me,
and
my
physical
wretchedness,
prevented
me,
for
I
was
bruised,
weary,
wet
to
the
skin,
deafened
and
blinded
by
the
storm.
I
had
a
vague
idea
of
going
on
to
my
own
house,
and
that
was
as
much
motive
as
I
had.
I
staggered
through
the
trees,
fell
into
a
ditch
and
bruised
my
knees
against
a
plank,
and
finally
splashed
out
into
the
lane
that
ran
down
from
the
College
Arms.
I
say
splashed,
for
the
storm
water
was
sweeping
the
sand
down
the
hill
in
a
muddy
torrent.
There
in
the
darkness
a
man
blundered
into
me
and
sent
me
reeling
back.
He
gave
a
cry
of
terror,
sprang
sideways,
and
rushed
on
before
I
could
gather
my
wits
sufficiently
to
speak
to
him.
So
heavy
was
the
stress
of
the
storm
just
at
this
place
that
I
had
the
hardest
task
to
win
my
way
up
the
hill.
I
went
close
up
to
the
fence
on
the
left
and
worked
my
way
along
its
palings.
Near
the
top
I
stumbled
upon
something
soft,
and,
by
a
flash
of
lightning,
saw
between
my
feet
a
heap
of
black
broadcloth
and
a
pair
of
boots.
Before
I
could
distinguish
clearly
how
the
man
lay,
the
flicker
of
light
had
passed.
I
stood
over
him
waiting
for
the
next
flash.
When
it
came,
I
saw
that
he
was
a
sturdy
man,
cheaply
but
not
shabbily
dressed;
his
head
was
bent
under
his
body,
and
he
lay
crumpled
up
close
to
the
fence,
as
though
he
had
been
flung
violently
against
it.
Overcoming
the
repugnance
natural
to
one
who
had
never
before
touched
a
dead
body,
I
stooped
and
turned
him
over
to
feel
for
his
heart.
He
was
quite
dead.
Apparently
his
neck
had
been
broken.
The
lightning
flashed
for
a
third
time,
and
his
face
leaped
upon
me.
I
sprang
to
my
feet.
It
was
the
landlord
of
the
Spotted
Dog,
whose
conveyance
I
had
taken.
I
stepped
over
him
gingerly
and
pushed
on
up
the
hill.
I
made
my
way
by
the
police
station
and
the
College
Arms
towards
my
own
house.
Nothing
was
burning
on
the
hillside,
though
from
the
common
there
still
came
a
red
glare
and
a
rolling
tumult
of
ruddy
smoke
beating
up
against
the
drenching
hail.
So
far
as
I
could
see
by
the
flashes,
the
houses
about
me
were
mostly
uninjured.
By
the
College
Arms
a
dark
heap
lay
in
the
road.
Down
the
road
towards
Maybury
Bridge
there
were
voices
and
the
sound
of
feet,
but
I
had
not
the
courage
to
shout
or
to
go
to
them.
I
let
myself
in
with
my
latchkey,
closed,
locked
and
bolted
the
door,
staggered
to
the
foot
of
the
staircase,
and
sat
down.
My
imagination
was
full
of
those
striding
metallic
monsters,
and
of
the
dead
body
smashed
against
the
fence.
I
crouched
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
with
my
back
to
the
wall,
shivering
violently.
CHAPTER
ELEVEN
AT
THE
WINDOW
I
have
already
said
that
my
storms
of
emotion
have
a
trick
of
exhausting
themselves.
After
a
time
I
discovered
that
I
was
cold
and
wet,
and
with
little
pools
of
water
about
me
on
the
stair
carpet.
I
got
up
almost
mechanically,
went
into
the
dining
room
and
drank
some
whiskey,
and
then
I
was
moved
to
change
my
clothes.
After
I
had
done
that
I
went
upstairs
to
my
study,
but
why
I
did
so
I
do
not
know.
The
window
of
my
study
looks
over
the
trees
and
the
railway
towards
Horsell
Common.
In
the
hurry
of
our
departure
this
window
had
been
left
open.
The
passage
was
dark,
and,
by
contrast
with
the
picture
the
window
frame
enclosed,
the
side
of
the
room
seemed
impenetrably
dark.
I
stopped
short
in
the
doorway.
The
thunderstorm
had
passed.
The
towers
of
the
Oriental
College
and
the
pine
trees
about
it
had
gone,
and
very
far
away,
lit
by
a
vivid
red
glare,
the
common
about
the
sand
pits
was
visible.
Across
the
light
huge
black
shapes,
grotesque
and
strange,
moved
busily
to
and
fro.
It
seemed
indeed
as
if
the
whole
country
in
that
direction
was
on
fire--a
broad
hillside
set
with
minute
tongues
of
flame,
swaying
and
writhing
with
the
gusts
of
the
dying
storm,
and
throwing
a
red
reflection
upon
the
cloud-scud
above.
Every
now
and
then
a
haze
of
smoke
from
some
nearer
conflagration
drove
across
the
window
and
hid
the
Martian
shapes.
I
could
not
see
what
they
were
doing,
nor
the
clear
form
of
them,
nor
recognise
the
black
objects
they
were
busied
upon.
Neither
could
I
see
the
nearer
fire,
though
the
reflections
of
it
danced
on
the
wall
and
ceiling
of
the
study.
A
sharp,
resinous
tang
of
burning
was
in
the
air.
I
closed
the
door
noiselessly
and
crept
towards
the
window.
As
I
did
so,
the
view
opened
out
until,
on
the
one
hand,
it
reached
to
the
houses
about
Woking
station,
and
on
the
other
to
the
charred
and
blackened
pine
woods
of
Byfleet.
There
was
a
light
down
below
the
hill,
on
the
railway,
near
the
arch,
and
several
of
the
houses
along
the
Maybury
road
and
the
streets
near
the
station
were
glowing
ruins.
The
light
upon
the
railway
puzzled
me
at
first;
there
were
a
black
heap
and
a
vivid
glare,
and
to
the
right
of
that
a
row
of
yellow
oblongs.
Then
I
perceived
this
was
a
wrecked
train,
the
fore
part
smashed
and
on
fire,
the
hinder
carriages
still
upon
the
rails.
Between
these
three
main
centres
of
light--the
houses,
the
train,
and
the
burning
county
towards
Chobham--stretched
irregular
patches
of
dark
country,
broken
here
and
there
by
intervals
of
dimly
glowing
and
smoking
ground.
It
was
the
strangest
spectacle,
that
black
expanse
set
with
fire.
It
reminded
me,
more
than
anything
else,
of
the
Potteries
at
night.
At
first
I
could
distinguish
no
people
at
all,
though
I
peered
intently
for
them.
Later
I
saw
against
the
light
of
Woking
station
a
number
of
black
figures
hurrying
one
after
the
other
across
the
line.
And
this
was
the
little
world
in
which
I
had
been
living
securely
for
years,
this
fiery
chaos!
What
had
happened
in
the
last
seven
hours
I
still
did
not
know;
nor
did
I
know,
though
I
was
beginning
to
guess,
the
relation
between
these
mechanical
colossi
and
the
sluggish
lumps
I
had
seen
disgorged
from
the
cylinder.
With
a
queer
feeling
of
impersonal
interest
I
turned
my
desk
chair
to
the
window,
sat
down,
and
stared
at
the
blackened
country,
and
particularly
at
the
three
gigantic
black
things
that
were
going
to
and
fro
in
the
glare
about
the
sand
pits.
They
seemed
amazingly
busy.
I
began
to
ask
myself
what
they
could
be.
Were
they
intelligent
mechanisms?
Such
a
thing
I
felt
was
impossible.
Or
did
a
Martian
sit
within
each,
ruling,
directing,
using,
much
as
a
man's
brain
sits
and
rules
in
his
body?
I
began
to
compare
the
things
to
human
machines,
to
ask
myself
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
how
an
ironclad
or
a
steam
engine
would
seem
to
an
intelligent
lower
animal.
The
storm
had
left
the
sky
clear,
and
over
the
smoke
of
the
burning
land
the
little
fading
pinpoint
of
Mars
was
dropping
into
the
west,
when
a
soldier
came
into
my
garden.
I
heard
a
slight
scraping
at
the
fence,
and
rousing
myself
from
the
lethargy
that
had
fallen
upon
me,
I
looked
down
and
saw
him
dimly,
clambering
over
the
palings.
At
the
sight
of
another
human
being
my
torpor
passed,
and
I
leaned
out
of
the
window
eagerly.
"Hist!"
said
I,
in
a
whisper.
He
stopped
astride
of
the
fence
in
doubt.
Then
he
came
over
and
across
the
lawn
to
the
corner
of
the
house.
He
bent
down
and
stepped
softly.
"Who's
there?"
he
said,
also
whispering,
standing
under
the
window
and
peering
up.
"Where
are
you
going?"
I
asked.
"God
knows."
"Are
you
trying
to
hide?"
"That's
it."
"Come
into
the
house,"
I
said.
I
went
down,
unfastened
the
door,
and
let
him
in,
and
locked
the
door
again.
I
could
not
see
his
face.
He
was
hatless,
and
his
coat
was
unbuttoned.
"My
God!"
he
said,
as
I
drew
him
in.
"What
has
happened?"
I
asked.
"What
hasn't?"
In
the
obscurity
I
could
see
he
made
a
gesture
of
despair.
"They
wiped
us
out--simply
wiped
us
out,"
he
repeated
again
and
again.
He
followed
me,
almost
mechanically,
into
the
dining
room.
"Take
some
whiskey,"
I
said,
pouring
out
a
stiff
dose.
He
drank
it.
Then
abruptly
he
sat
down
before
the
table,
put
his
head
on
his
arms,
and
began
to
sob
and
weep
like
a
little
boy,
in
a
perfect
passion
of
emotion,
while
I,
with
a
curious
forgetfulness
of
my
own
recent
despair,
stood
beside
him,
wondering.
It
was
a
long
time
before
he
could
steady
his
nerves
to
answer
my
questions,
and
then
he
answered
perplexingly
and
brokenly.
He
was
a
driver
in
the
artillery,
and
had
only
come
into
action
about
seven.
At
that
time
firing
was
going
on
across
the
common,
and
it
was
said
the
first
party
of
Martians
were
crawling
slowly
towards
their
second
cylinder
under
cover
of
a
metal
shield.
Later
this
shield
staggered
up
on
tripod
legs
and
became
the
first
of
the
fighting-machines
I
had
seen.
The
gun
he
drove
had
been
unlimbered
near
Horsell,
in
order
to
command
the
sand
pits,
and
its
arrival
it
was
that
had
precipitated
the
action.
As
the
limber
gunners
went
to
the
rear,
his
horse
trod
in
a
rabbit
hole
and
came
down,
throwing
him
into
a
depression
of
the
ground.
At
the
same
moment
the
gun
exploded
behind
him,
the
ammunition
blew
up,
there
was
fire
all
about
him,
and
he
found
himself
lying
under
a
heap
of
charred
dead
men
and
dead
horses.
"I
lay
still,"
he
said,
"scared
out
of
my
wits,
with
the
fore
quarter
of
a
horse
atop
of
me.
We'd
been
wiped
out.
And
the
smell--good
God!
Like
burnt
meat!
I
was
hurt
across
the
back
by
the
fall
of
the
horse,
and
there
I
had
to
lie
until
I
felt
better.
Just
like
parade
it
had
been
a
minute
before--then
stumble,
bang,
swish!"
"Wiped
out!"
he
said.
He
had
hid
under
the
dead
horse
for
a
long
time,
peeping
out
furtively
across
the
common.
The
Cardigan
men
had
tried
a
rush,
in
skirmishing
order,
at
the
pit,
simply
to
be
swept
out
of
existence.
Then
the
monster
had
risen
to
its
feet
and
had
begun
to
walk
leisurely
to
and
fro
across
the
common
among
the
few
fugitives,
with
its
headlike
hood
turning
about
exactly
like
the
head
of
a
cowled
human
being.
A
kind
of
arm
carried
a
complicated
metallic
case,
about
which
green
flashes
scintillated,
and
out
of
the
funnel
of
this
there
smoked
the
Heat-Ray.
In
a
few
minutes
there
was,
so
far
as
the
soldier
could
see,
not
a
living
thing
left
upon
the
common,
and
every
bush
and
tree
upon
it
that
was
not
already
a
blackened
skeleton
was
burning.
The
hussars
had
been
on
the
road
beyond
the
curvature
of
the
ground,
and
he
saw
nothing
of
them.
He
heard
the
Martians
rattle
for
a
time
and
then
become
still.
The
giant
saved
Woking
station
and
its
cluster
of
houses
until
the
last;
then
in
a
moment
the
Heat-Ray
was
brought
to
bear,
and
the
town
became
a
heap
of
fiery
ruins.
Then
the
Thing
shut
off
the
Heat-Ray,
and
turning
its
back
upon
the
artilleryman,
began
to
waddle
away
towards
the
smouldering
pine
woods
that
sheltered
the
second
cylinder.
As
it
did
so
a
second
glittering
Titan
built
itself
up
out
of
the
pit.
The
second
monster
followed
the
first,
and
at
that
the
artilleryman
began
to
crawl
very
cautiously
across
the
hot
heather
ash
towards
Horsell.
He
managed
to
get
alive
into
the
ditch
by
the
side
of
the
road,
and
so
escaped
to
Woking.
There
his
story
became
ejaculatory.
The
place
was
impassable.
It
seems
there
were
a
few
people
alive
there,
frantic
for
the
most
part
and
many
burned
and
scalded.
He
was
turned
aside
by
the
fire,
and
hid
among
some
almost
scorching
heaps
of
broken
wall
as
one
of
the
Martian
giants
returned.
He
saw
this
one
pursue
a
man,
catch
him
up
in
one
of
its
steely
tentacles,
and
knock
his
head
against
the
trunk
of
a
pine
tree.
At
last,
after
nightfall,
the
artilleryman
made
a
rush
for
it
and
got
over
the
railway
embankment.
Since
then
he
had
been
skulking
along
towards
Maybury,
in
the
hope
of
getting
out
of
danger
Londonward.
People
were
hiding
in
trenches
and
cellars,
and
many
of
the
survivors
had
made
off
towards
Woking
village
and
Send.
He
had
been
consumed
with
thirst
until
he
found
one
of
the
water
mains
near
the
railway
arch
smashed,
and
the
water
bubbling
out
like
a
spring
upon
the
road.
That
was
the
story
I
got
from
him,
bit
by
bit.
He
grew
calmer
telling
me
and
trying
to
make
me
see
the
things
he
had
seen.
He
had
eaten
no
food
since
midday,
he
told
me
early
in
his
narrative,
and
I
found
some
mutton
and
bread
in
the
pantry
and
brought
it
into
the
room.
We
lit
no
lamp
for
fear
of
attracting
the
Martians,
and
ever
and
again
our
hands
would
touch
upon
bread
or
meat.
As
he
talked,
things
about
us
came
darkly
out
of
the
darkness,
and
the
trampled
bushes
and
broken
rose
trees
outside
the
window
grew
distinct.
It
would
seem
that
a
number
of
men
or
animals
had
rushed
across
the
lawn.
I
began
to
see
his
face,
blackened
and
haggard,
as
no
doubt
mine
was
also.
When
we
had
finished
eating
we
went
softly
upstairs
to
my
study,
and
I
looked
again
out
of
the
open
window.
In
one
night
the
valley
had
become
a
valley
of
ashes.
The
fires
had
dwindled
now.
Where
flames
had
been
there
were
now
streamers
of
smoke;
but
the
countless
ruins
of
shattered
and
gutted
houses
and
blasted
and
blackened
trees
that
the
night
had
hidden
stood
out
now
gaunt
and
terrible
in
the
pitiless
light
of
dawn.
Yet
here
and
there
some
object
had
had
the
luck
to
escape--a
white
railway
signal
here,
the
end
of
a
greenhouse
there,
white
and
fresh
amid
the
wreckage.
Never
before
in
the
history
of
warfare
had
destruction
been
so
indiscriminate
and
so
universal.
And
shining
with
the
growing
light
of
the
east,
three
of
the
metallic
giants
stood
about
the
pit,
their
cowls
rotating
as
though
they
were
surveying
the
desolation
they
had
made.
It
seemed
to
me
that
the
pit
had
been
enlarged,
and
ever
and
again
puffs
of
vivid
green
vapour
streamed
up
and
out
of
it
towards
the
brightening
dawn--streamed
up,
whirled,
broke,
and
vanished.
Beyond
were
the
pillars
of
fire
about
Chobham.
They
became
pillars
of
bloodshot
smoke
at
the
first
touch
of
day.
CHAPTER
TWELVE
WHAT
I
SAW
OF
THE
DESTRUCTION
OF
WEYBRIDGE
AND
SHEPPERTON
As
the
dawn
grew
brighter
we
withdrew
from
the
window
from
which
we
had
watched
the
Martians,
and
went
very
quietly
downstairs.
The
artilleryman
agreed
with
me
that
the
house
was
no
place
to
stay
in.
He
proposed,
he
said,
to
make
his
way
Londonward,
and
thence
rejoin
his
battery--No.
12,
of
the
Horse
Artillery.
My
plan
was
to
return
at
once
to
Leatherhead;
and
so
greatly
had
the
strength
of
the
Martians
impressed
me
that
I
had
determined
to
take
my
wife
to
Newhaven,
and
go
with
her
out
of
the
country
forthwith.
For
I
already
perceived
clearly
that
the
country
about
London
must
inevitably
be
the
scene
of
a
disastrous
struggle
before
such
creatures
as
these
could
be
destroyed.
Between
us
and
Leatherhead,
however,
lay
the
third
cylinder,
with
its
guarding
giants.
Had
I
been
alone,
I
think
I
should
have
taken
my
chance
and
struck
across
country.
But
the
artilleryman
dissuaded
me:
"It's
no
kindness
to
the
right
sort
of
wife,"
he
said,
"to
make
her
a
widow";
and
in
the
end
I
agreed
to
go
with
him,
under
cover
of
the
woods,
northward
as
far
as
Street
Cobham
before
I
parted
with
him.
Thence
I
would
make
a
big
detour
by
Epsom
to
reach
Leatherhead.
I
should
have
started
at
once,
but
my
companion
had
been
in
active
service
and
he
knew
better
than
that.
He
made
me
ransack
the
house
for
a
flask,
which
he
filled
with
whiskey;
and
we
lined
every
available
pocket
with
packets
of
biscuits
and
slices
of
meat.
Then
we
crept
out
of
the
house,
and
ran
as
quickly
as
we
could
down
the
ill-made
road
by
which
I
had
come
overnight.
The
houses
seemed
deserted.
In
the
road
lay
a
group
of
three
charred
bodies
close
together,
struck
dead
by
the
Heat-Ray;
and
here
and
there
were
things
that
people
had
dropped--a
clock,
a
slipper,
a
silver
spoon,
and
the
like
poor
valuables.
At
the
corner
turning
up
towards
the
post
office
a
little
cart,
filled
with
boxes
and
furniture,
and
horseless,
heeled
over
on
a
broken
wheel.
A
cash
box
had
been
hastily
smashed
open
and
thrown
under
the
debris.
Except
the
lodge
at
the
Orphanage,
which
was
still
on
fire,
none
of
the
houses
had
suffered
very
greatly
here.
The
Heat-Ray
had
shaved
the
chimney
tops
and
passed.
Yet,
save
ourselves,
there
did
not
seem
to
be
a
living
soul
on
Maybury
Hill.
The
majority
of
the
inhabitants
had
escaped,
I
suppose,
by
way
of
the
Old
Woking
road--the
road
I
had
taken
when
I
drove
to
Leatherhead--or
they
had
hidden.
We
went
down
the
lane,
by
the
body
of
the
man
in
black,
sodden
now
from
the
overnight
hail,
and
broke
into
the
woods
at
the
foot
of
the
hill.
We
pushed
through
these
towards
the
railway
without
meeting
a
soul.
The
woods
across
the
line
were
but
the
scarred
and
blackened
ruins
of
woods;
for
the
most
part
the
trees
had
fallen,
but
a
certain
proportion
still
stood,
dismal
grey
stems,
with
dark
brown
foliage
instead
of
green.
On
our
side
the
fire
had
done
no
more
than
scorch
the
nearer
trees;
it
had
failed
to
secure
its
footing.
In
one
place
the
woodmen
had
been
at
work
on
Saturday;
trees,
felled
and
freshly
trimmed,
lay
in
a
clearing,
with
heaps
of
sawdust
by
the
sawing-machine
and
its
engine.
Hard
by
was
a
temporary
hut,
deserted.
There
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
this
morning,
and
everything
was
strangely
still.
Even
the
birds
were
hushed,
and
as
we
hurried
along
I
and
the
artilleryman
talked
in
whispers
and
looked
now
and
again
over
our
shoulders.
Once
or
twice
we
stopped
to
listen.
After
a
time
we
drew
near
the
road,
and
as
we
did
so
we
heard
the
clatter
of
hoofs
and
saw
through
the
tree
stems
three
cavalry
soldiers
riding
slowly
towards
Woking.
We
hailed
them,
and
they
halted
while
we
hurried
towards
them.
It
was
a
lieutenant
and
a
couple
of
privates
of
the
8th
Hussars,
with
a
stand
like
a
theodolite,
which
the
artilleryman
told
me
was
a
heliograph.
"You
are
the
first
men
I've
seen
coming
this
way
this
morning,"
said
the
lieutenant.
"What's
brewing?"
His
voice
and
face
were
eager.
The
men
behind
him
stared
curiously.
The
artilleryman
jumped
down
the
bank
into
the
road
and
saluted.
"Gun
destroyed
last
night,
sir.
Have
been
hiding.
Trying
to
rejoin
battery,
sir.
You'll
come
in
sight
of
the
Martians,
I
expect,
about
half
a
mile
along
this
road."
"What
the
dickens
are
they
like?"
asked
the
lieutenant.
"Giants
in
armour,
sir.
Hundred
feet
high.
Three
legs
and
a
body
like
'luminium,
with
a
mighty
great
head
in
a
hood,
sir."
"Get
out!"
said
the
lieutenant.
"What
confounded
nonsense!"
"You'll
see,
sir.
They
carry
a
kind
of
box,
sir,
that
shoots
fire
and
strikes
you
dead."
"What
d'ye
mean--a
gun?"
"No,
sir,"
and
the
artilleryman
began
a
vivid
account
of
the
Heat-Ray.
Halfway
through,
the
lieutenant
interrupted
him
and
looked
up
at
me.
I
was
still
standing
on
the
bank
by
the
side
of
the
road.
"It's
perfectly
true,"
I
said.
"Well,"
said
the
lieutenant,
"I
suppose
it's
my
business
to
see
it
too.
Look
here"--to
the
artilleryman--"we're
detailed
here
clearing
people
out
of
their
houses.
You'd
better
go
along
and
report
yourself
to
Brigadier-General
Marvin,
and
tell
him
all
you
know.
He's
at
Weybridge.
Know
the
way?"
"I
do,"
I
said;
and
he
turned
his
horse
southward
again.
"Half
a
mile,
you
say?"
said
he.
"At
most,"
I
answered,
and
pointed
over
the
treetops
southward.
He
thanked
me
and
rode
on,
and
we
saw
them
no
more.
Farther
along
we
came
upon
a
group
of
three
women
and
two
children
in
the
road,
busy
clearing
out
a
labourer's
cottage.
They
had
got
hold
of
a
little
hand
truck,
and
were
piling
it
up
with
unclean-looking
bundles
and
shabby
furniture.
They
were
all
too
assiduously
engaged
to
talk
to
us
as
we
passed.
By
Byfleet
station
we
emerged
from
the
pine
trees,
and
found
the
country
calm
and
peaceful
under
the
morning
sunlight.
We
were
far
beyond
the
range
of
the
Heat-Ray
there,
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
silent
desertion
of
some
of
the
houses,
the
stirring
movement
of
packing
in
others,
and
the
knot
of
soldiers
standing
on
the
bridge
over
the
railway
and
staring
down
the
line
towards
Woking,
the
day
would
have
seemed
very
like
any
other
Sunday.
Several
farm
waggons
and
carts
were
moving
creakily
along
the
road
to
Addlestone,
and
suddenly
through
the
gate
of
a
field
we
saw,
across
a
stretch
of
flat
meadow,
six
twelve-pounders
standing
neatly
at
equal
distances
pointing
towards
Woking.
The
gunners
stood
by
the
guns
waiting,
and
the
ammunition
waggons
were
at
a
business-like
distance.
The
men
stood
almost
as
if
under
inspection.
"That's
good!"
said
I.
"They
will
get
one
fair
shot,
at
any
rate."
The
artilleryman
hesitated
at
the
gate.
"I
shall
go
on,"
he
said.
Farther
on
towards
Weybridge,
just
over
the
bridge,
there
were
a
number
of
men
in
white
fatigue
jackets
throwing
up
a
long
rampart,
and
more
guns
behind.
"It's
bows
and
arrows
against
the
lightning,
anyhow,"
said
the
artilleryman.
"They
'aven't
seen
that
fire-beam
yet."
The
officers
who
were
not
actively
engaged
stood
and
stared
over
the
treetops
southwestward,
and
the
men
digging
would
stop
every
now
and
again
to
stare
in
the
same
direction.
Byfleet
was
in
a
tumult;
people
packing,
and
a
score
of
hussars,
some
of
them
dismounted,
some
on
horseback,
were
hunting
them
about.
Three
or
four
black
government
waggons,
with
crosses
in
white
circles,
and
an
old
omnibus,
among
other
vehicles,
were
being
loaded
in
the
village
street.
There
were
scores
of
people,
most
of
them
sufficiently
sabbatical
to
have
assumed
their
best
clothes.
The
soldiers
were
having
the
greatest
difficulty
in
making
them
realise
the
gravity
of
their
position.
We
saw
one
shrivelled
old
fellow
with
a
huge
box
and
a
score
or
more
of
flower
pots
containing
orchids,
angrily
expostulating
with
the
corporal
who
would
leave
them
behind.
I
stopped
and
gripped
his
arm.
"Do
you
know
what's
over
there?"
I
said,
pointing
at
the
pine
tops
that
hid
the
Martians.
"Eh?"
said
he,
turning.
"I
was
explainin'
these
is
vallyble."
"Death!"
I
shouted.
"Death
is
coming!
Death!"
and
leaving
him
to
digest
that
if
he
could,
I
hurried
on
after
the
artillery-man.
At
the
corner
I
looked
back.
The
soldier
had
left
him,
and
he
was
still
standing
by
his
box,
with
the
pots
of
orchids
on
the
lid
of
it,
and
staring
vaguely
over
the
trees.
No
one
in
Weybridge
could
tell
us
where
the
headquarters
were
established;
the
whole
place
was
in
such
confusion
as
I
had
never
seen
in
any
town
before.
Carts,
carriages
everywhere,
the
most
astonishing
miscellany
of
conveyances
and
horseflesh.
The
respectable
inhabitants
of
the
place,
men
in
golf
and
boating
costumes,
wives
prettily
dressed,
were
packing,
river-side
loafers
energetically
helping,
children
excited,
and,
for
the
most
part,
highly
delighted
at
this
astonishing
variation
of
their
Sunday
experiences.
In
the
midst
of
it
all
the
worthy
vicar
was
very
pluckily
holding
an
early
celebration,
and
his
bell
was
jangling
out
above
the
excitement.
I
and
the
artilleryman,
seated
on
the
step
of
the
drinking
fountain,
made
a
very
passable
meal
upon
what
we
had
brought
with
us.
Patrols
of
soldiers--here
no
longer
hussars,
but
grenadiers
in
white--were
warning
people
to
move
now
or
to
take
refuge
in
their
cellars
as
soon
as
the
firing
began.
We
saw
as
we
crossed
the
railway
bridge
that
a
growing
crowd
of
people
had
assembled
in
and
about
the
railway
station,
and
the
swarming
platform
was
piled
with
boxes
and
packages.
The
ordinary
traffic
had
been
stopped,
I
believe,
in
order
to
allow
of
the
passage
of
troops
and
guns
to
Chertsey,
and
I
have
heard
since
that
a
savage
struggle
occurred
for
places
in
the
special
trains
that
were
put
on
at
a
later
hour.
We
remained
at
Weybridge
until
midday,
and
at
that
hour
we
found
ourselves
at
the
place
near
Shepperton
Lock
where
the
Wey
and
Thames
join.
Part
of
the
time
we
spent
helping
two
old
women
to
pack
a
little
cart.
The
Wey
has
a
treble
mouth,
and
at
this
point
boats
are
to
be
hired,
and
there
was
a
ferry
across
the
river.
On
the
Shepperton
side
was
an
inn
with
a
lawn,
and
beyond
that
the
tower
of
Shepperton
Church--it
has
been
replaced
by
a
spire--rose
above
the
trees.
Here
we
found
an
excited
and
noisy
crowd
of
fugitives.
As
yet
the
flight
had
not
grown
to
a
panic,
but
there
were
already
far
more
people
than
all
the
boats
going
to
and
fro
could
enable
to
cross.
People
came
panting
along
under
heavy
burdens;
one
husband
and
wife
were
even
carrying
a
small
outhouse
door
between
them,
with
some
of
their
household
goods
piled
thereon.
One
man
told
us
he
meant
to
try
to
get
away
from
Shepperton
station.
There
was
a
lot
of
shouting,
and
one
man
was
even
jesting.
The
idea
people
seemed
to
have
here
was
that
the
Martians
were
simply
formidable
human
beings,
who
might
attack
and
sack
the
town,
to
be
certainly
destroyed
in
the
end.
Every
now
and
then
people
would
glance
nervously
across
the
Wey,
at
the
meadows
towards
Chertsey,
but
everything
over
there
was
still.
Across
the
Thames,
except
just
where
the
boats
landed,
everything
was
quiet,
in
vivid
contrast
with
the
Surrey
side.
The
people
who
landed
there
from
the
boats
went
tramping
off
down
the
lane.
The
big
ferryboat
had
just
made
a
journey.
Three
or
four
soldiers
stood
on
the
lawn
of
the
inn,
staring
and
jesting
at
the
fugitives,
without
offering
to
help.
The
inn
was
closed,
as
it
was
now
within
prohibited
hours.
"What's
that?"
cried
a
boatman,
and
"Shut
up,
you
fool!"
said
a
man
near
me
to
a
yelping
dog.
Then
the
sound
came
again,
this
time
from
the
direction
of
Chertsey,
a
muffled
thud--the
sound
of
a
gun.
The
fighting
was
beginning.
Almost
immediately
unseen
batteries
across
the
river
to
our
right,
unseen
because
of
the
trees,
took
up
the
chorus,
firing
heavily
one
after
the
other.
A
woman
screamed.
Everyone
stood
arrested
by
the
sudden
stir
of
battle,
near
us
and
yet
invisible
to
us.
Nothing
was
to
be
seen
save
flat
meadows,
cows
feeding
unconcernedly
for
the
most
part,
and
silvery
pollard
willows
motionless
in
the
warm
sunlight.
"The
sojers'll
stop
'em,"
said
a
woman
beside
me,
doubtfully.
A
haziness
rose
over
the
treetops.
Then
suddenly
we
saw
a
rush
of
smoke
far
away
up
the
river,
a
puff
of
smoke
that
jerked
up
into
the
air
and
hung;
and
forthwith
the
ground
heaved
under
foot
and
a
heavy
explosion
shook
the
air,
smashing
two
or
three
windows
in
the
houses
near,
and
leaving
us
astonished.
"Here
they
are!"
shouted
a
man
in
a
blue
jersey.
"Yonder!
D'yer
see
them?
Yonder!"
Quickly,
one
after
the
other,
one,
two,
three,
four
of
the
armoured
Martians
appeared,
far
away
over
the
little
trees,
across
the
flat
meadows
that
stretched
towards
Chertsey,
and
striding
hurriedly
towards
the
river.
Little
cowled
figures
they
seemed
at
first,
going
with
a
rolling
motion
and
as
fast
as
flying
birds.
Then,
advancing
obliquely
towards
us,
came
a
fifth.
Their
armoured
bodies
glittered
in
the
sun
as
they
swept
swiftly
forward
upon
the
guns,
growing
rapidly
larger
as
they
drew
nearer.
One
on
the
extreme
left,
the
remotest
that
is,
flourished
a
huge
case
high
in
the
air,
and
the
ghostly,
terrible
Heat-Ray
I
had
already
seen
on
Friday
night
smote
towards
Chertsey,
and
struck
the
town.
At
sight
of
these
strange,
swift,
and
terrible
creatures
the
crowd
near
the
water's
edge
seemed
to
me
to
be
for
a
moment
horror-struck.
There
was
no
screaming
or
shouting,
but
a
silence.
Then
a
hoarse
murmur
and
a
movement
of
feet--a
splashing
from
the
water.
A
man,
too
frightened
to
drop
the
portmanteau
he
carried
on
his
shoulder,
swung
round
and
sent
me
staggering
with
a
blow
from
the
corner
of
his
burden.
A
woman
thrust
at
me
with
her
hand
and
rushed
past
me.
I
turned
with
the
rush
of
the
people,
but
I
was
not
too
terrified
for
thought.
The
terrible
Heat-Ray
was
in
my
mind.
To
get
under
water!
That
was
it!
"Get
under
water!"
I
shouted,
unheeded.
I
faced
about
again,
and
rushed
towards
the
approaching
Martian,
rushed
right
down
the
gravelly
beach
and
headlong
into
the
water.
Others
did
the
same.
A
boatload
of
people
putting
back
came
leaping
out
as
I
rushed
past.
The
stones
under
my
feet
were
muddy
and
slippery,
and
the
river
was
so
low
that
I
ran
perhaps
twenty
feet
scarcely
waist-deep.
Then,
as
the
Martian
towered
overhead
scarcely
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
away,
I
flung
myself
forward
under
the
surface.
The
splashes
of
the
people
in
the
boats
leaping
into
the
river
sounded
like
thunderclaps
in
my
ears.
People
were
landing
hastily
on
both
sides
of
the
river.
But
the
Martian
machine
took
no
more
notice
for
the
moment
of
the
people
running
this
way
and
that
than
a
man
would
of
the
confusion
of
ants
in
a
nest
against
which
his
foot
has
kicked.
When,
half
suffocated,
I
raised
my
head
above
water,
the
Martian's
hood
pointed
at
the
batteries
that
were
still
firing
across
the
river,
and
as
it
advanced
it
swung
loose
what
must
have
been
the
generator
of
the
Heat-Ray.
In
another
moment
it
was
on
the
bank,
and
in
a
stride
wading
halfway
across.
The
knees
of
its
foremost
legs
bent
at
the
farther
bank,
and
in
another
moment
it
had
raised
itself
to
its
full
height
again,
close
to
the
village
of
Shepperton.
Forthwith
the
six
guns
which,
unknown
to
anyone
on
the
right
bank,
had
been
hidden
behind
the
outskirts
of
that
village,
fired
simultaneously.
The
sudden
near
concussion,
the
last
close
upon
the
first,
made
my
heart
jump.
The
monster
was
already
raising
the
case
generating
the
Heat-Ray
as
the
first
shell
burst
six
yards
above
the
hood.
I
gave
a
cry
of
astonishment.
I
saw
and
thought
nothing
of
the
other
four
Martian
monsters;
my
attention
was
riveted
upon
the
nearer
incident.
Simultaneously
two
other
shells
burst
in
the
air
near
the
body
as
the
hood
twisted
round
in
time
to
receive,
but
not
in
time
to
dodge,
the
fourth
shell.
The
shell
burst
clean
in
the
face
of
the
Thing.
The
hood
bulged,
flashed,
was
whirled
off
in
a
dozen
tattered
fragments
of
red
flesh
and
glittering
metal.
"Hit!"
shouted
I,
with
something
between
a
scream
and
a
cheer.
I
heard
answering
shouts
from
the
people
in
the
water
about
me.
I
could
have
leaped
out
of
the
water
with
that
momentary
exultation.
The
decapitated
colossus
reeled
like
a
drunken
giant;
but
it
did
not
fall
over.
It
recovered
its
balance
by
a
miracle,
and,
no
longer
heeding
its
steps
and
with
the
camera
that
fired
the
Heat-Ray
now
rigidly
upheld,
it
reeled
swiftly
upon
Shepperton.
The
living
intelligence,
the
Martian
within
the
hood,
was
slain
and
splashed
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven,
and
the
Thing
was
now
but
a
mere
intricate
device
of
metal
whirling
to
destruction.
It
drove
along
in
a
straight
line,
incapable
of
guidance.
It
struck
the
tower
of
Shepperton
Church,
smashing
it
down
as
the
impact
of
a
battering
ram
might
have
done,
swerved
aside,
blundered
on
and
collapsed
with
tremendous
force
into
the
river
out
of
my
sight.
A
violent
explosion
shook
the
air,
and
a
spout
of
water,
steam,
mud,
and
shattered
metal
shot
far
up
into
the
sky.
As
the
camera
of
the
Heat-Ray
hit
the
water,
the
latter
had
immediately
flashed
into
steam.
In
another
moment
a
huge
wave,
like
a
muddy
tidal
bore
but
almost
scaldingly
hot,
came
sweeping
round
the
bend
upstream.
I
saw
people
struggling
shorewards,
and
heard
their
screaming
and
shouting
faintly
above
the
seething
and
roar
of
the
Martian's
collapse.
For
a
moment
I
heeded
nothing
of
the
heat,
forgot
the
patent
need
of
self-preservation.
I
splashed
through
the
tumultuous
water,
pushing
aside
a
man
in
black
to
do
so,
until
I
could
see
round
the
bend.
Half
a
dozen
deserted
boats
pitched
aimlessly
upon
the
confusion
of
the
waves.
The
fallen
Martian
came
into
sight
downstream,
lying
across
the
river,
and
for
the
most
part
submerged.
Thick
clouds
of
steam
were
pouring
off
the
wreckage,
and
through
the
tumultuously
whirling
wisps
I
could
see,
intermittently
and
vaguely,
the
gigantic
limbs
churning
the
water
and
flinging
a
splash
and
spray
of
mud
and
froth
into
the
air.
The
tentacles
swayed
and
struck
like
living
arms,
and,
save
for
the
helpless
purposelessness
of
these
movements,
it
was
as
if
some
wounded
thing
were
struggling
for
its
life
amid
the
waves.
Enormous
quantities
of
a
ruddy-brown
fluid
were
spurting
up
in
noisy
jets
out
of
the
machine.
My
attention
was
diverted
from
this
death
flurry
by
a
furious
yelling,
like
that
of
the
thing
called
a
siren
in
our
manufacturing
towns.
A
man,
knee-deep
near
the
towing
path,
shouted
inaudibly
to
me
and
pointed.
Looking
back,
I
saw
the
other
Martians
advancing
with
gigantic
strides
down
the
riverbank
from
the
direction
of
Chertsey.
The
Shepperton
guns
spoke
this
time
unavailingly.
At
that
I
ducked
at
once
under
water,
and,
holding
my
breath
until
movement
was
an
agony,
blundered
painfully
ahead
under
the
surface
as
long
as
I
could.
The
water
was
in
a
tumult
about
me,
and
rapidly
growing
hotter.
When
for
a
moment
I
raised
my
head
to
take
breath
and
throw
the
hair
and
water
from
my
eyes,
the
steam
was
rising
in
a
whirling
white
fog
that
at
first
hid
the
Martians
altogether.
The
noise
was
deafening.
Then
I
saw
them
dimly,
colossal
figures
of
grey,
magnified
by
the
mist.
They
had
passed
by
me,
and
two
were
stooping
over
the
frothing,
tumultuous
ruins
of
their
comrade.
The
third
and
fourth
stood
beside
him
in
the
water,
one
perhaps
two
hundred
yards
from
me,
the
other
towards
Laleham.
The
generators
of
the
Heat-Rays
waved
high,
and
the
hissing
beams
smote
down
this
way
and
that.
The
air
was
full
of
sound,
a
deafening
and
confusing
conflict
of
noises--the
clangorous
din
of
the
Martians,
the
crash
of
falling
houses,
the
thud
of
trees,
fences,
sheds
flashing
into
flame,
and
the
crackling
and
roaring
of
fire.
Dense
black
smoke
was
leaping
up
to
mingle
with
the
steam
from
the
river,
and
as
the
Heat-Ray
went
to
and
fro
over
Weybridge
its
impact
was
marked
by
flashes
of
incandescent
white,
that
gave
place
at
once
to
a
smoky
dance
of
lurid
flames.
The
nearer
houses
still
stood
intact,
awaiting
their
fate,
shadowy,
faint
and
pallid
in
the
steam,
with
the
fire
behind
them
going
to
and
fro.
For
a
moment
perhaps
I
stood
there,
breast-high
in
the
almost
boiling
water,
dumbfounded
at
my
position,
hopeless
of
escape.
Through
the
reek
I
could
see
the
people
who
had
been
with
me
in
the
river
scrambling
out
of
the
water
through
the
reeds,
like
little
frogs
hurrying
through
grass
from
the
advance
of
a
man,
or
running
to
and
fro
in
utter
dismay
on
the
towing
path.
Then
suddenly
the
white
flashes
of
the
Heat-Ray
came
leaping
towards
me.
The
houses
caved
in
as
they
dissolved
at
its
touch,
and
darted
out
flames;
the
trees
changed
to
fire
with
a
roar.
The
Ray
flickered
up
and
down
the
towing
path,
licking
off
the
people
who
ran
this
way
and
that,
and
came
down
to
the
water's
edge
not
fifty
yards
from
where
I
stood.
It
swept
across
the
river
to
Shepperton,
and
the
water
in
its
track
rose
in
a
boiling
weal
crested
with
steam.
I
turned
shoreward.
In
another
moment
the
huge
wave,
well-nigh
at
the
boiling-point
had
rushed
upon
me.
I
screamed
aloud,
and
scalded,
half
blinded,
agonised,
I
staggered
through
the
leaping,
hissing
water
towards
the
shore.
Had
my
foot
stumbled,
it
would
have
been
the
end.
I
fell
helplessly,
in
full
sight
of
the
Martians,
upon
the
broad,
bare
gravelly
spit
that
runs
down
to
mark
the
angle
of
the
Wey
and
Thames.
I
expected
nothing
but
death.
I
have
a
dim
memory
of
the
foot
of
a
Martian
coming
down
within
a
score
of
yards
of
my
head,
driving
straight
into
the
loose
gravel,
whirling
it
this
way
and
that
and
lifting
again;
of
a
long
suspense,
and
then
of
the
four
carrying
the
debris
of
their
comrade
between
them,
now
clear
and
then
presently
faint
through
a
veil
of
smoke,
receding
interminably,
as
it
seemed
to
me,
across
a
vast
space
of
river
and
meadow.
And
then,
very
slowly,
I
realised
that
by
a
miracle
I
had
escaped.
CHAPTER
THIRTEEN
HOW
I
FELL
IN
WITH
THE
CURATE
After
getting
this
sudden
lesson
in
the
power
of
terrestrial
weapons,
the
Martians
retreated
to
their
original
position
upon
Horsell
Common;
and
in
their
haste,
and
encumbered
with
the
debris
of
their
smashed
companion,
they
no
doubt
overlooked
many
such
a
stray
and
negligible
victim
as
myself.
Had
they
left
their
comrade
and
pushed
on
forthwith,
there
was
nothing
at
that
time
between
them
and
London
but
batteries
of
twelve-pounder
guns,
and
they
would
certainly
have
reached
the
capital
in
advance
of
the
tidings
of
their
approach;
as
sudden,
dreadful,
and
destructive
their
advent
would
have
been
as
the
earthquake
that
destroyed
Lisbon
a
century
ago.
But
they
were
in
no
hurry.
Cylinder
followed
cylinder
on
its
interplanetary
flight;
every
twenty-four
hours
brought
them
reinforcement.
And
meanwhile
the
military
and
naval
authorities,
now
fully
alive
to
the
tremendous
power
of
their
antagonists,
worked
with
furious
energy.
Every
minute
a
fresh
gun
came
into
position
until,
before
twilight,
every
copse,
every
row
of
suburban
villas
on
the
hilly
slopes
about
Kingston
and
Richmond,
masked
an
expectant
black
muzzle.
And
through
the
charred
and
desolated
area--perhaps
twenty
square
miles
altogether--that
encircled
the
Martian
encampment
on
Horsell
Common,
through
charred
and
ruined
villages
among
the
green
trees,
through
the
blackened
and
smoking
arcades
that
had
been
but
a
day
ago
pine
spinneys,
crawled
the
devoted
scouts
with
the
heliographs
that
were
presently
to
warn
the
gunners
of
the
Martian
approach.
But
the
Martians
now
understood
our
command
of
artillery
and
the
danger
of
human
proximity,
and
not
a
man
ventured
within
a
mile
of
either
cylinder,
save
at
the
price
of
his
life.
It
would
seem
that
these
giants
spent
the
earlier
part
of
the
afternoon
in
going
to
and
fro,
transferring
everything
from
the
second
and
third
cylinders--the
second
in
Addlestone
Golf
Links
and
the
third
at
Pyrford--to
their
original
pit
on
Horsell
Common.
Over
that,
above
the
blackened
heather
and
ruined
buildings
that
stretched
far
and
wide,
stood
one
as
sentinel,
while
the
rest
abandoned
their
vast
fighting-machines
and
descended
into
the
pit.
They
were
hard
at
work
there
far
into
the
night,
and
the
towering
pillar
of
dense
green
smoke
that
rose
therefrom
could
be
seen
from
the
hills
about
Merrow,
and
even,
it
is
said,
from
Banstead
and
Epsom
Downs.
And
while
the
Martians
behind
me
were
thus
preparing
for
their
next
sally,
and
in
front
of
me
Humanity
gathered
for
the
battle,
I
made
my
way
with
infinite
pains
and
labour
from
the
fire
and
smoke
of
burning
Weybridge
towards
London.
I
saw
an
abandoned
boat,
very
small
and
remote,
drifting
down-stream;
and
throwing
off
the
most
of
my
sodden
clothes,
I
went
after
it,
gained
it,
and
so
escaped
out
of
that
destruction.
There
were
no
oars
in
the
boat,
but
I
contrived
to
paddle,
as
well
as
my
parboiled
hands
would
allow,
down
the
river
towards
Halliford
and
Walton,
going
very
tediously
and
continually
looking
behind
me,
as
you
may
well
understand.
I
followed
the
river,
because
I
considered
that
the
water
gave
me
my
best
chance
of
escape
should
these
giants
return.
The
hot
water
from
the
Martian's
overthrow
drifted
downstream
with
me,
so
that
for
the
best
part
of
a
mile
I
could
see
little
of
either
bank.
Once,
however,
I
made
out
a
string
of
black
figures
hurrying
across
the
meadows
from
the
direction
of
Weybridge.
Halliford,
it
seemed,
was
deserted,
and
several
of
the
houses
facing
the
river
were
on
fire.
It
was
strange
to
see
the
place
quite
tranquil,
quite
desolate
under
the
hot
blue
sky,
with
the
smoke
and
little
threads
of
flame
going
straight
up
into
the
heat
of
the
afternoon.
Never
before
had
I
seen
houses
burning
without
the
accompaniment
of
an
obstructive
crowd.
A
little
farther
on
the
dry
reeds
up
the
bank
were
smoking
and
glowing,
and
a
line
of
fire
inland
was
marching
steadily
across
a
late
field
of
hay.
For
a
long
time
I
drifted,
so
painful
and
weary
was
I
after
the
violence
I
had
been
through,
and
so
intense
the
heat
upon
the
water.
Then
my
fears
got
the
better
of
me
again,
and
I
resumed
my
paddling.
The
sun
scorched
my
bare
back.
At
last,
as
the
bridge
at
Walton
was
coming
into
sight
round
the
bend,
my
fever
and
faintness
overcame
my
fears,
and
I
landed
on
the
Middlesex
bank
and
lay
down,
deadly
sick,
amid
the
long
grass.
I
suppose
the
time
was
then
about
four
or
five
o'clock.
I
got
up
presently,
walked
perhaps
half
a
mile
without
meeting
a
soul,
and
then
lay
down
again
in
the
shadow
of
a
hedge.
I
seem
to
remember
talking,
wanderingly,
to
myself
during
that
last
spurt.
I
was
also
very
thirsty,
and
bitterly
regretful
I
had
drunk
no
more
water.
It
is
a
curious
thing
that
I
felt
angry
with
my
wife;
I
cannot
account
for
it,
but
my
impotent
desire
to
reach
Leatherhead
worried
me
excessively.
I
do
not
clearly
remember
the
arrival
of
the
curate,
so
that
probably
I
dozed.
I
became
aware
of
him
as
a
seated
figure
in
soot-smudged
shirt
sleeves,
and
with
his
upturned,
clean-shaven
face
staring
at
a
faint
flickering
that
danced
over
the
sky.
The
sky
was
what
is
called
a
mackerel
sky--rows
and
rows
of
faint
down-plumes
of
cloud,
just
tinted
with
the
midsummer
sunset.
I
sat
up,
and
at
the
rustle
of
my
motion
he
looked
at
me
quickly.
"Have
you
any
water?"
I
asked
abruptly.
He
shook
his
head.
"You
have
been
asking
for
water
for
the
last
hour,"
he
said.
For
a
moment
we
were
silent,
taking
stock
of
each
other.
I
dare
say
he
found
me
a
strange
enough
figure,
naked,
save
for
my
water-soaked
trousers
and
socks,
scalded,
and
my
face
and
shoulders
blackened
by
the
smoke.
His
face
was
a
fair
weakness,
his
chin
retreated,
and
his
hair
lay
in
crisp,
almost
flaxen
curls
on
his
low
forehead;
his
eyes
were
rather
large,
pale
blue,
and
blankly
staring.
He
spoke
abruptly,
looking
vacantly
away
from
me.
"What
does
it
mean?"
he
said.
"What
do
these
things
mean?"
I
stared
at
him
and
made
no
answer.
He
extended
a
thin
white
hand
and
spoke
in
almost
a
complaining
tone.
"Why
are
these
things
permitted?
What
sins
have
we
done?
The
morning
service
was
over,
I
was
walking
through
the
roads
to
clear
my
brain
for
the
afternoon,
and
then--fire,
earthquake,
death!
As
if
it
were
Sodom
and
Gomorrah!
All
our
work
undone,
all
the
work----
What
are
these
Martians?"
"What
are
we?"
I
answered,
clearing
my
throat.
He
gripped
his
knees
and
turned
to
look
at
me
again.
For
half
a
minute,
perhaps,
he
stared
silently.
"I
was
walking
through
the
roads
to
clear
my
brain,"
he
said.
"And
suddenly--fire,
earthquake,
death!"
He
relapsed
into
silence,
with
his
chin
now
sunken
almost
to
his
knees.
Presently
he
began
waving
his
hand.
"All
the
work--all
the
Sunday
schools--What
have
we
done--what
has
Weybridge
done?
Everything
gone--everything
destroyed.
The
church!
We
rebuilt
it
only
three
years
ago.
Gone!
Swept
out
of
existence!
Why?"
Another
pause,
and
he
broke
out
again
like
one
demented.
"The
smoke
of
her
burning
goeth
up
for
ever
and
ever!"
he
shouted.
His
eyes
flamed,
and
he
pointed
a
lean
finger
in
the
direction
of
Weybridge.
By
this
time
I
was
beginning
to
take
his
measure.
The
tremendous
tragedy
in
which
he
had
been
involved--it
was
evident
he
was
a
fugitive
from
Weybridge--had
driven
him
to
the
very
verge
of
his
reason.
"Are
we
far
from
Sunbury?"
I
said,
in
a
matter-of-fact
tone.
"What
are
we
to
do?"
he
asked.
"Are
these
creatures
everywhere?
Has
the
earth
been
given
over
to
them?"
"Are
we
far
from
Sunbury?"
"Only
this
morning
I
officiated
at
early
celebration----"
"Things
have
changed,"
I
said,
quietly.
"You
must
keep
your
head.
There
is
still
hope."
"Hope!"
"Yes.
Plentiful
hope--for
all
this
destruction!"
I
began
to
explain
my
view
of
our
position.
He
listened
at
first,
but
as
I
went
on
the
interest
dawning
in
his
eyes
gave
place
to
their
former
stare,
and
his
regard
wandered
from
me.
"This
must
be
the
beginning
of
the
end,"
he
said,
interrupting
me.
"The
end!
The
great
and
terrible
day
of
the
Lord!
When
men
shall
call
upon
the
mountains
and
the
rocks
to
fall
upon
them
and
hide
them--hide
them
from
the
face
of
Him
that
sitteth
upon
the
throne!"
I
began
to
understand
the
position.
I
ceased
my
laboured
reasoning,
struggled
to
my
feet,
and,
standing
over
him,
laid
my
hand
on
his
shoulder.
"Be
a
man!"
said
I.
"You
are
scared
out
of
your
wits!
What
good
is
religion
if
it
collapses
under
calamity?
Think
of
what
earthquakes
and
floods,
wars
and
volcanoes,
have
done
before
to
men!
Did
you
think
God
had
exempted
Weybridge?
He
is
not
an
insurance
agent."
For
a
time
he
sat
in
blank
silence.
"But
how
can
we
escape?"
he
asked,
suddenly.
"They
are
invulnerable,
they
are
pitiless."
"Neither
the
one
nor,
perhaps,
the
other,"
I
answered.
"And
the
mightier
they
are
the
more
sane
and
wary
should
we
be.
One
of
them
was
killed
yonder
not
three
hours
ago."
"Killed!"
he
said,
staring
about
him.
"How
can
God's
ministers
be
killed?"
"I
saw
it
happen."
I
proceeded
to
tell
him.
"We
have
chanced
to
come
in
for
the
thick
of
it,"
said
I,
"and
that
is
all."
"What
is
that
flicker
in
the
sky?"
he
asked
abruptly.
I
told
him
it
was
the
heliograph
signalling--that
it
was
the
sign
of
human
help
and
effort
in
the
sky.
"We
are
in
the
midst
of
it,"
I
said,
"quiet
as
it
is.
That
flicker
in
the
sky
tells
of
the
gathering
storm.
Yonder,
I
take
it
are
the
Martians,
and
Londonward,
where
those
hills
rise
about
Richmond
and
Kingston
and
the
trees
give
cover,
earthworks
are
being
thrown
up
and
guns
are
being
placed.
Presently
the
Martians
will
be
coming
this
way
again."
And
even
as
I
spoke
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
stopped
me
by
a
gesture.
"Listen!"
he
said.
From
beyond
the
low
hills
across
the
water
came
the
dull
resonance
of
distant
guns
and
a
remote
weird
crying.
Then
everything
was
still.
A
cockchafer
came
droning
over
the
hedge
and
past
us.
High
in
the
west
the
crescent
moon
hung
faint
and
pale
above
the
smoke
of
Weybridge
and
Shepperton
and
the
hot,
still
splendour
of
the
sunset.
"We
had
better
follow
this
path,"
I
said,
"northward."
CHAPTER
FOURTEEN
IN
LONDON
My
younger
brother
was
in
London
when
the
Martians
fell
at
Woking.
He
was
a
medical
student
working
for
an
imminent
examination,
and
he
heard
nothing
of
the
arrival
until
Saturday
morning.
The
morning
papers
on
Saturday
contained,
in
addition
to
lengthy
special
articles
on
the
planet
Mars,
on
life
in
the
planets,
and
so
forth,
a
brief
and
vaguely
worded
telegram,
all
the
more
striking
for
its
brevity.
The
Martians,
alarmed
by
the
approach
of
a
crowd,
had
killed
a
number
of
people
with
a
quick-firing
gun,
so
the
story
ran.
The
telegram
concluded
with
the
words:
"Formidable
as
they
seem
to
be,
the
Martians
have
not
moved
from
the
pit
into
which
they
have
fallen,
and,
indeed,
seem
incapable
of
doing
so.
Probably
this
is
due
to
the
relative
strength
of
the
earth's
gravitational
energy."
On
that
last
text
their
leader-writer
expanded
very
comfortingly.
Of
course
all
the
students
in
the
crammer's
biology
class,
to
which
my
brother
went
that
day,
were
intensely
interested,
but
there
were
no
signs
of
any
unusual
excitement
in
the
streets.
The
afternoon
papers
puffed
scraps
of
news
under
big
headlines.
They
had
nothing
to
tell
beyond
the
movements
of
troops
about
the
common,
and
the
burning
of
the
pine
woods
between
Woking
and
Weybridge,
until
eight.
Then
the
_St.
James's
Gazette_,
in
an
extra-special
edition,
announced
the
bare
fact
of
the
interruption
of
telegraphic
communication.
This
was
thought
to
be
due
to
the
falling
of
burning
pine
trees
across
the
line.
Nothing
more
of
the
fighting
was
known
that
night,
the
night
of
my
drive
to
Leatherhead
and
back.
My
brother
felt
no
anxiety
about
us,
as
he
knew
from
the
description
in
the
papers
that
the
cylinder
was
a
good
two
miles
from
my
house.
He
made
up
his
mind
to
run
down
that
night
to
me,
in
order,
as
he
says,
to
see
the
Things
before
they
were
killed.
He
dispatched
a
telegram,
which
never
reached
me,
about
four
o'clock,
and
spent
the
evening
at
a
music
hall.
In
London,
also,
on
Saturday
night
there
was
a
thunderstorm,
and
my
brother
reached
Waterloo
in
a
cab.
On
the
platform
from
which
the
midnight
train
usually
starts
he
learned,
after
some
waiting,
that
an
accident
prevented
trains
from
reaching
Woking
that
night.
The
nature
of
the
accident
he
could
not
ascertain;
indeed,
the
railway
authorities
did
not
clearly
know
at
that
time.
There
was
very
little
excitement
in
the
station,
as
the
officials,
failing
to
realise
that
anything
further
than
a
breakdown
between
Byfleet
and
Woking
junction
had
occurred,
were
running
the
theatre
trains
which
usually
passed
through
Woking
round
by
Virginia
Water
or
Guildford.
They
were
busy
making
the
necessary
arrangements
to
alter
the
route
of
the
Southampton
and
Portsmouth
Sunday
League
excursions.
A
nocturnal
newspaper
reporter,
mistaking
my
brother
for
the
traffic
manager,
to
whom
he
bears
a
slight
resemblance,
waylaid
and
tried
to
interview
him.
Few
people,
excepting
the
railway
officials,
connected
the
breakdown
with
the
Martians.
I
have
read,
in
another
account
of
these
events,
that
on
Sunday
morning
"all
London
was
electrified
by
the
news
from
Woking."
As
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
nothing
to
justify
that
very
extravagant
phrase.
Plenty
of
Londoners
did
not
hear
of
the
Martians
until
the
panic
of
Monday
morning.
Those
who
did
took
some
time
to
realise
all
that
the
hastily
worded
telegrams
in
the
Sunday
papers
conveyed.
The
majority
of
people
in
London
do
not
read
Sunday
papers.
The
habit
of
personal
security,
moreover,
is
so
deeply
fixed
in
the
Londoner's
mind,
and
startling
intelligence
so
much
a
matter
of
course
in
the
papers,
that
they
could
read
without
any
personal
tremors:
"About
seven
o'clock
last
night
the
Martians
came
out
of
the
cylinder,
and,
moving
about
under
an
armour
of
metallic
shields,
have
completely
wrecked
Woking
station
with
the
adjacent
houses,
and
massacred
an
entire
battalion
of
the
Cardigan
Regiment.
No
details
are
known.
Maxims
have
been
absolutely
useless
against
their
armour;
the
field
guns
have
been
disabled
by
them.
Flying
hussars
have
been
galloping
into
Chertsey.
The
Martians
appear
to
be
moving
slowly
towards
Chertsey
or
Windsor.
Great
anxiety
prevails
in
West
Surrey,
and
earthworks
are
being
thrown
up
to
check
the
advance
Londonward."
That
was
how
the
Sunday
_Sun_
put
it,
and
a
clever
and
remarkably
prompt
"handbook"
article
in
the
_Referee_
compared
the
affair
to
a
menagerie
suddenly
let
loose
in
a
village.
No
one
in
London
knew
positively
of
the
nature
of
the
armoured
Martians,
and
there
was
still
a
fixed
idea
that
these
monsters
must
be
sluggish:
"crawling,"
"creeping
painfully"--such
expressions
occurred
in
almost
all
the
earlier
reports.
None
of
the
telegrams
could
have
been
written
by
an
eyewitness
of
their
advance.
The
Sunday
papers
printed
separate
editions
as
further
news
came
to
hand,
some
even
in
default
of
it.
But
there
was
practically
nothing
more
to
tell
people
until
late
in
the
afternoon,
when
the
authorities
gave
the
press
agencies
the
news
in
their
possession.
It
was
stated
that
the
people
of
Walton
and
Weybridge,
and
all
the
district
were
pouring
along
the
roads
Londonward,
and
that
was
all.
My
brother
went
to
church
at
the
Foundling
Hospital
in
the
morning,
still
in
ignorance
of
what
had
happened
on
the
previous
night.
There
he
heard
allusions
made
to
the
invasion,
and
a
special
prayer
for
peace.
Coming
out,
he
bought
a
_Referee_.
He
became
alarmed
at
the
news
in
this,
and
went
again
to
Waterloo
station
to
find
out
if
communication
were
restored.
The
omnibuses,
carriages,
cyclists,
and
innumerable
people
walking
in
their
best
clothes
seemed
scarcely
affected
by
the
strange
intelligence
that
the
news
venders
were
disseminating.
People
were
interested,
or,
if
alarmed,
alarmed
only
on
account
of
the
local
residents.
At
the
station
he
heard
for
the
first
time
that
the
Windsor
and
Chertsey
lines
were
now
interrupted.
The
porters
told
him
that
several
remarkable
telegrams
had
been
received
in
the
morning
from
Byfleet
and
Chertsey
stations,
but
that
these
had
abruptly
ceased.
My
brother
could
get
very
little
precise
detail
out
of
them.
"There's
fighting
going
on
about
Weybridge"
was
the
extent
of
their
information.
The
train
service
was
now
very
much
disorganised.
Quite
a
number
of
people
who
had
been
expecting
friends
from
places
on
the
South-Western
network
were
standing
about
the
station.
One
grey-headed
old
gentleman
came
and
abused
the
South-Western
Company
bitterly
to
my
brother.
"It
wants
showing
up,"
he
said.
One
or
two
trains
came
in
from
Richmond,
Putney,
and
Kingston,
containing
people
who
had
gone
out
for
a
day's
boating
and
found
the
locks
closed
and
a
feeling
of
panic
in
the
air.
A
man
in
a
blue
and
white
blazer
addressed
my
brother,
full
of
strange
tidings.
"There's
hosts
of
people
driving
into
Kingston
in
traps
and
carts
and
things,
with
boxes
of
valuables
and
all
that,"
he
said.
"They
come
from
Molesey
and
Weybridge
and
Walton,
and
they
say
there's
been
guns
heard
at
Chertsey,
heavy
firing,
and
that
mounted
soldiers
have
told
them
to
get
off
at
once
because
the
Martians
are
coming.
We
heard
guns
firing
at
Hampton
Court
station,
but
we
thought
it
was
thunder.
What
the
dickens
does
it
all
mean?
The
Martians
can't
get
out
of
their
pit,
can
they?"
My
brother
could
not
tell
him.
Afterwards
he
found
that
the
vague
feeling
of
alarm
had
spread
to
the
clients
of
the
underground
railway,
and
that
the
Sunday
excursionists
began
to
return
from
all
over
the
South-Western
"lung"--Barnes,
Wimbledon,
Richmond
Park,
Kew,
and
so
forth--at
unnaturally
early
hours;
but
not
a
soul
had
anything
more
than
vague
hearsay
to
tell
of.
Everyone
connected
with
the
terminus
seemed
ill-tempered.
About
five
o'clock
the
gathering
crowd
in
the
station
was
immensely
excited
by
the
opening
of
the
line
of
communication,
which
is
almost
invariably
closed,
between
the
South-Eastern
and
the
South-Western
stations,
and
the
passage
of
carriage
trucks
bearing
huge
guns
and
carriages
crammed
with
soldiers.
These
were
the
guns
that
were
brought
up
from
Woolwich
and
Chatham
to
cover
Kingston.
There
was
an
exchange
of
pleasantries:
"You'll
get
eaten!"
"We're
the
beast-tamers!"
and
so
forth.
A
little
while
after
that
a
squad
of
police
came
into
the
station
and
began
to
clear
the
public
off
the
platforms,
and
my
brother
went
out
into
the
street
again.
The
church
bells
were
ringing
for
evensong,
and
a
squad
of
Salvation
Army
lassies
came
singing
down
Waterloo
Road.
On
the
bridge
a
number
of
loafers
were
watching
a
curious
brown
scum
that
came
drifting
down
the
stream
in
patches.
The
sun
was
just
setting,
and
the
Clock
Tower
and
the
Houses
of
Parliament
rose
against
one
of
the
most
peaceful
skies
it
is
possible
to
imagine,
a
sky
of
gold,
barred
with
long
transverse
stripes
of
reddish-purple
cloud.
There
was
talk
of
a
floating
body.
One
of
the
men
there,
a
reservist
he
said
he
was,
told
my
brother
he
had
seen
the
heliograph
flickering
in
the
west.
In
Wellington
Street
my
brother
met
a
couple
of
sturdy
roughs
who
had
just
been
rushed
out
of
Fleet
Street
with
still-wet
newspapers
and
staring
placards.
"Dreadful
catastrophe!"
they
bawled
one
to
the
other
down
Wellington
Street.
"Fighting
at
Weybridge!
Full
description!
Repulse
of
the
Martians!
London
in
Danger!"
He
had
to
give
threepence
for
a
copy
of
that
paper.
Then
it
was,
and
then
only,
that
he
realised
something
of
the
full
power
and
terror
of
these
monsters.
He
learned
that
they
were
not
merely
a
handful
of
small
sluggish
creatures,
but
that
they
were
minds
swaying
vast
mechanical
bodies;
and
that
they
could
move
swiftly
and
smite
with
such
power
that
even
the
mightiest
guns
could
not
stand
against
them.
They
were
described
as
"vast
spiderlike
machines,
nearly
a
hundred
feet
high,
capable
of
the
speed
of
an
express
train,
and
able
to
shoot
out
a
beam
of
intense
heat."
Masked
batteries,
chiefly
of
field
guns,
had
been
planted
in
the
country
about
Horsell
Common,
and
especially
between
the
Woking
district
and
London.
Five
of
the
machines
had
been
seen
moving
towards
the
Thames,
and
one,
by
a
happy
chance,
had
been
destroyed.
In
the
other
cases
the
shells
had
missed,
and
the
batteries
had
been
at
once
annihilated
by
the
Heat-Rays.
Heavy
losses
of
soldiers
were
mentioned,
but
the
tone
of
the
dispatch
was
optimistic.
The
Martians
had
been
repulsed;
they
were
not
invulnerable.
They
had
retreated
to
their
triangle
of
cylinders
again,
in
the
circle
about
Woking.
Signallers
with
heliographs
were
pushing
forward
upon
them
from
all
sides.
Guns
were
in
rapid
transit
from
Windsor,
Portsmouth,
Aldershot,
Woolwich--even
from
the
north;
among
others,
long
wire-guns
of
ninety-five
tons
from
Woolwich.
Altogether
one
hundred
and
sixteen
were
in
position
or
being
hastily
placed,
chiefly
covering
London.
Never
before
in
England
had
there
been
such
a
vast
or
rapid
concentration
of
military
material.
Any
further
cylinders
that
fell,
it
was
hoped,
could
be
destroyed
at
once
by
high
explosives,
which
were
being
rapidly
manufactured
and
distributed.
No
doubt,
ran
the
report,
the
situation
was
of
the
strangest
and
gravest
description,
but
the
public
was
exhorted
to
avoid
and
discourage
panic.
No
doubt
the
Martians
were
strange
and
terrible
in
the
extreme,
but
at
the
outside
there
could
not
be
more
than
twenty
of
them
against
our
millions.
The
authorities
had
reason
to
suppose,
from
the
size
of
the
cylinders,
that
at
the
outside
there
could
not
be
more
than
five
in
each
cylinder--fifteen
altogether.
And
one
at
least
was
disposed
of--perhaps
more.
The
public
would
be
fairly
warned
of
the
approach
of
danger,
and
elaborate
measures
were
being
taken
for
the
protection
of
the
people
in
the
threatened
southwestern
suburbs.
And
so,
with
reiterated
assurances
of
the
safety
of
London
and
the
ability
of
the
authorities
to
cope
with
the
difficulty,
this
quasi-proclamation
closed.
This
was
printed
in
enormous
type
on
paper
so
fresh
that
it
was
still
wet,
and
there
had
been
no
time
to
add
a
word
of
comment.
It
was
curious,
my
brother
said,
to
see
how
ruthlessly
the
usual
contents
of
the
paper
had
been
hacked
and
taken
out
to
give
this
place.
All
down
Wellington
Street
people
could
be
seen
fluttering
out
the
pink
sheets
and
reading,
and
the
Strand
was
suddenly
noisy
with
the
voices
of
an
army
of
hawkers
following
these
pioneers.
Men
came
scrambling
off
buses
to
secure
copies.
Certainly
this
news
excited
people
intensely,
whatever
their
previous
apathy.
The
shutters
of
a
map
shop
in
the
Strand
were
being
taken
down,
my
brother
said,
and
a
man
in
his
Sunday
raiment,
lemon-yellow
gloves
even,
was
visible
inside
the
window
hastily
fastening
maps
of
Surrey
to
the
glass.
Going
on
along
the
Strand
to
Trafalgar
Square,
the
paper
in
his
hand,
my
brother
saw
some
of
the
fugitives
from
West
Surrey.
There
was
a
man
with
his
wife
and
two
boys
and
some
articles
of
furniture
in
a
cart
such
as
greengrocers
use.
He
was
driving
from
the
direction
of
Westminster
Bridge;
and
close
behind
him
came
a
hay
waggon
with
five
or
six
respectable-looking
people
in
it,
and
some
boxes
and
bundles.
The
faces
of
these
people
were
haggard,
and
their
entire
appearance
contrasted
conspicuously
with
the
Sabbath-best
appearance
of
the
people
on
the
omnibuses.
People
in
fashionable
clothing
peeped
at
them
out
of
cabs.
They
stopped
at
the
Square
as
if
undecided
which
way
to
take,
and
finally
turned
eastward
along
the
Strand.
Some
way
behind
these
came
a
man
in
workday
clothes,
riding
one
of
those
old-fashioned
tricycles
with
a
small
front
wheel.
He
was
dirty
and
white
in
the
face.
My
brother
turned
down
towards
Victoria,
and
met
a
number
of
such
people.
He
had
a
vague
idea
that
he
might
see
something
of
me.
He
noticed
an
unusual
number
of
police
regulating
the
traffic.
Some
of
the
refugees
were
exchanging
news
with
the
people
on
the
omnibuses.
One
was
professing
to
have
seen
the
Martians.
"Boilers
on
stilts,
I
tell
you,
striding
along
like
men."
Most
of
them
were
excited
and
animated
by
their
strange
experience.
Beyond
Victoria
the
public-houses
were
doing
a
lively
trade
with
these
arrivals.
At
all
the
street
corners
groups
of
people
were
reading
papers,
talking
excitedly,
or
staring
at
these
unusual
Sunday
visitors.
They
seemed
to
increase
as
night
drew
on,
until
at
last
the
roads,
my
brother
said,
were
like
Epsom
High
Street
on
a
Derby
Day.
My
brother
addressed
several
of
these
fugitives
and
got
unsatisfactory
answers
from
most.
None
of
them
could
tell
him
any
news
of
Woking
except
one
man,
who
assured
him
that
Woking
had
been
entirely
destroyed
on
the
previous
night.
"I
come
from
Byfleet,"
he
said;
"man
on
a
bicycle
came
through
the
place
in
the
early
morning,
and
ran
from
door
to
door
warning
us
to
come
away.
Then
came
soldiers.
We
went
out
to
look,
and
there
were
clouds
of
smoke
to
the
south--nothing
but
smoke,
and
not
a
soul
coming
that
way.
Then
we
heard
the
guns
at
Chertsey,
and
folks
coming
from
Weybridge.
So
I've
locked
up
my
house
and
come
on."
At
the
time
there
was
a
strong
feeling
in
the
streets
that
the
authorities
were
to
blame
for
their
incapacity
to
dispose
of
the
invaders
without
all
this
inconvenience.
About
eight
o'clock
a
noise
of
heavy
firing
was
distinctly
audible
all
over
the
south
of
London.
My
brother
could
not
hear
it
for
the
traffic
in
the
main
thoroughfares,
but
by
striking
through
the
quiet
back
streets
to
the
river
he
was
able
to
distinguish
it
quite
plainly.
He
walked
from
Westminster
to
his
apartments
near
Regent's
Park,
about
two.
He
was
now
very
anxious
on
my
account,
and
disturbed
at
the
evident
magnitude
of
the
trouble.
His
mind
was
inclined
to
run,
even
as
mine
had
run
on
Saturday,
on
military
details.
He
thought
of
all
those
silent,
expectant
guns,
of
the
suddenly
nomadic
countryside;
he
tried
to
imagine
"boilers
on
stilts"
a
hundred
feet
high.
There
were
one
or
two
cartloads
of
refugees
passing
along
Oxford
Street,
and
several
in
the
Marylebone
Road,
but
so
slowly
was
the
news
spreading
that
Regent
Street
and
Portland
Place
were
full
of
their
usual
Sunday-night
promenaders,
albeit
they
talked
in
groups,
and
along
the
edge
of
Regent's
Park
there
were
as
many
silent
couples
"walking
out"
together
under
the
scattered
gas
lamps
as
ever
there
had
been.
The
night
was
warm
and
still,
and
a
little
oppressive;
the
sound
of
guns
continued
intermittently,
and
after
midnight
there
seemed
to
be
sheet
lightning
in
the
south.
He
read
and
re-read
the
paper,
fearing
the
worst
had
happened
to
me.
He
was
restless,
and
after
supper
prowled
out
again
aimlessly.
He
returned
and
tried
in
vain
to
divert
his
attention
to
his
examination
notes.
He
went
to
bed
a
little
after
midnight,
and
was
awakened
from
lurid
dreams
in
the
small
hours
of
Monday
by
the
sound
of
door
knockers,
feet
running
in
the
street,
distant
drumming,
and
a
clamour
of
bells.
Red
reflections
danced
on
the
ceiling.
For
a
moment
he
lay
astonished,
wondering
whether
day
had
come
or
the
world
gone
mad.
Then
he
jumped
out
of
bed
and
ran
to
the
window.
His
room
was
an
attic
and
as
he
thrust
his
head
out,
up
and
down
the
street
there
were
a
dozen
echoes
to
the
noise
of
his
window
sash,
and
heads
in
every
kind
of
night
disarray
appeared.
Enquiries
were
being
shouted.
"They
are
coming!"
bawled
a
policeman,
hammering
at
the
door;
"the
Martians
are
coming!"
and
hurried
to
the
next
door.
The
sound
of
drumming
and
trumpeting
came
from
the
Albany
Street
Barracks,
and
every
church
within
earshot
was
hard
at
work
killing
sleep
with
a
vehement
disorderly
tocsin.
There
was
a
noise
of
doors
opening,
and
window
after
window
in
the
houses
opposite
flashed
from
darkness
into
yellow
illumination.
Up
the
street
came
galloping
a
closed
carriage,
bursting
abruptly
into
noise
at
the
corner,
rising
to
a
clattering
climax
under
the
window,
and
dying
away
slowly
in
the
distance.
Close
on
the
rear
of
this
came
a
couple
of
cabs,
the
forerunners
of
a
long
procession
of
flying
vehicles,
going
for
the
most
part
to
Chalk
Farm
station,
where
the
North-Western
special
trains
were
loading
up,
instead
of
coming
down
the
gradient
into
Euston.
For
a
long
time
my
brother
stared
out
of
the
window
in
blank
astonishment,
watching
the
policemen
hammering
at
door
after
door,
and
delivering
their
incomprehensible
message.
Then
the
door
behind
him
opened,
and
the
man
who
lodged
across
the
landing
came
in,
dressed
only
in
shirt,
trousers,
and
slippers,
his
braces
loose
about
his
waist,
his
hair
disordered
from
his
pillow.
"What
the
devil
is
it?"
he
asked.
"A
fire?
What
a
devil
of
a
row!"
They
both
craned
their
heads
out
of
the
window,
straining
to
hear
what
the
policemen
were
shouting.
People
were
coming
out
of
the
side
streets,
and
standing
in
groups
at
the
corners
talking.
"What
the
devil
is
it
all
about?"
said
my
brother's
fellow
lodger.
My
brother
answered
him
vaguely
and
began
to
dress,
running
with
each
garment
to
the
window
in
order
to
miss
nothing
of
the
growing
excitement.
And
presently
men
selling
unnaturally
early
newspapers
came
bawling
into
the
street:
"London
in
danger
of
suffocation!
The
Kingston
and
Richmond
defences
forced!
Fearful
massacres
in
the
Thames
Valley!"
And
all
about
him--in
the
rooms
below,
in
the
houses
on
each
side
and
across
the
road,
and
behind
in
the
Park
Terraces
and
in
the
hundred
other
streets
of
that
part
of
Marylebone,
and
the
Westbourne
Park
district
and
St.
Pancras,
and
westward
and
northward
in
Kilburn
and
St.
John's
Wood
and
Hampstead,
and
eastward
in
Shoreditch
and
Highbury
and
Haggerston
and
Hoxton,
and,
indeed,
through
all
the
vastness
of
London
from
Ealing
to
East
Ham--people
were
rubbing
their
eyes,
and
opening
windows
to
stare
out
and
ask
aimless
questions,
dressing
hastily
as
the
first
breath
of
the
coming
storm
of
Fear
blew
through
the
streets.
It
was
the
dawn
of
the
great
panic.
London,
which
had
gone
to
bed
on
Sunday
night
oblivious
and
inert,
was
awakened,
in
the
small
hours
of
Monday
morning,
to
a
vivid
sense
of
danger.
Unable
from
his
window
to
learn
what
was
happening,
my
brother
went
down
and
out
into
the
street,
just
as
the
sky
between
the
parapets
of
the
houses
grew
pink
with
the
early
dawn.
The
flying
people
on
foot
and
in
vehicles
grew
more
numerous
every
moment.
"Black
Smoke!"
he
heard
people
crying,
and
again
"Black
Smoke!"
The
contagion
of
such
a
unanimous
fear
was
inevitable.
As
my
brother
hesitated
on
the
door-step,
he
saw
another
news
vender
approaching,
and
got
a
paper
forthwith.
The
man
was
running
away
with
the
rest,
and
selling
his
papers
for
a
shilling
each
as
he
ran--a
grotesque
mingling
of
profit
and
panic.
And
from
this
paper
my
brother
read
that
catastrophic
dispatch
of
the
Commander-in-Chief:
"The
Martians
are
able
to
discharge
enormous
clouds
of
a
black
and
poisonous
vapour
by
means
of
rockets.
They
have
smothered
our
batteries,
destroyed
Richmond,
Kingston,
and
Wimbledon,
and
are
advancing
slowly
towards
London,
destroying
everything
on
the
way.
It
is
impossible
to
stop
them.
There
is
no
safety
from
the
Black
Smoke
but
in
instant
flight."
That
was
all,
but
it
was
enough.
The
whole
population
of
the
great
six-million
city
was
stirring,
slipping,
running;
presently
it
would
be
pouring
_en
masse_
northward.
"Black
Smoke!"
the
voices
cried.
"Fire!"
The
bells
of
the
neighbouring
church
made
a
jangling
tumult,
a
cart
carelessly
driven
smashed,
amid
shrieks
and
curses,
against
the
water
trough
up
the
street.
Sickly
yellow
lights
went
to
and
fro
in
the
houses,
and
some
of
the
passing
cabs
flaunted
unextinguished
lamps.
And
overhead
the
dawn
was
growing
brighter,
clear
and
steady
and
calm.
He
heard
footsteps
running
to
and
fro
in
the
rooms,
and
up
and
down
stairs
behind
him.
His
landlady
came
to
the
door,
loosely
wrapped
in
dressing
gown
and
shawl;
her
husband
followed
ejaculating.
As
my
brother
began
to
realise
the
import
of
all
these
things,
he
turned
hastily
to
his
own
room,
put
all
his
available
money--some
ten
pounds
altogether--into
his
pockets,
and
went
out
again
into
the
streets.
CHAPTER
FIFTEEN
WHAT
HAD
HAPPENED
IN
SURREY
It
was
while
the
curate
had
sat
and
talked
so
wildly
to
me
under
the
hedge
in
the
flat
meadows
near
Halliford,
and
while
my
brother
was
watching
the
fugitives
stream
over
Westminster
Bridge,
that
the
Martians
had
resumed
the
offensive.
So
far
as
one
can
ascertain
from
the
conflicting
accounts
that
have
been
put
forth,
the
majority
of
them
remained
busied
with
preparations
in
the
Horsell
pit
until
nine
that
night,
hurrying
on
some
operation
that
disengaged
huge
volumes
of
green
smoke.
But
three
certainly
came
out
about
eight
o'clock
and,
advancing
slowly
and
cautiously,
made
their
way
through
Byfleet
and
Pyrford
towards
Ripley
and
Weybridge,
and
so
came
in
sight
of
the
expectant
batteries
against
the
setting
sun.
These
Martians
did
not
advance
in
a
body,
but
in
a
line,
each
perhaps
a
mile
and
a
half
from
his
nearest
fellow.
They
communicated
with
one
another
by
means
of
sirenlike
howls,
running
up
and
down
the
scale
from
one
note
to
another.
It
was
this
howling
and
firing
of
the
guns
at
Ripley
and
St.
George's
Hill
that
we
had
heard
at
Upper
Halliford.
The
Ripley
gunners,
unseasoned
artillery
volunteers
who
ought
never
to
have
been
placed
in
such
a
position,
fired
one
wild,
premature,
ineffectual
volley,
and
bolted
on
horse
and
foot
through
the
deserted
village,
while
the
Martian,
without
using
his
Heat-Ray,
walked
serenely
over
their
guns,
stepped
gingerly
among
them,
passed
in
front
of
them,
and
so
came
unexpectedly
upon
the
guns
in
Painshill
Park,
which
he
destroyed.
The
St.
George's
Hill
men,
however,
were
better
led
or
of
a
better
mettle.
Hidden
by
a
pine
wood
as
they
were,
they
seem
to
have
been
quite
unsuspected
by
the
Martian
nearest
to
them.
They
laid
their
guns
as
deliberately
as
if
they
had
been
on
parade,
and
fired
at
about
a
thousand
yards'
range.
The
shells
flashed
all
round
him,
and
he
was
seen
to
advance
a
few
paces,
stagger,
and
go
down.
Everybody
yelled
together,
and
the
guns
were
reloaded
in
frantic
haste.
The
overthrown
Martian
set
up
a
prolonged
ululation,
and
immediately
a
second
glittering
giant,
answering
him,
appeared
over
the
trees
to
the
south.
It
would
seem
that
a
leg
of
the
tripod
had
been
smashed
by
one
of
the
shells.
The
whole
of
the
second
volley
flew
wide
of
the
Martian
on
the
ground,
and,
simultaneously,
both
his
companions
brought
their
Heat-Rays
to
bear
on
the
battery.
The
ammunition
blew
up,
the
pine
trees
all
about
the
guns
flashed
into
fire,
and
only
one
or
two
of
the
men
who
were
already
running
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
escaped.
After
this
it
would
seem
that
the
three
took
counsel
together
and
halted,
and
the
scouts
who
were
watching
them
report
that
they
remained
absolutely
stationary
for
the
next
half
hour.
The
Martian
who
had
been
overthrown
crawled
tediously
out
of
his
hood,
a
small
brown
figure,
oddly
suggestive
from
that
distance
of
a
speck
of
blight,
and
apparently
engaged
in
the
repair
of
his
support.
About
nine
he
had
finished,
for
his
cowl
was
then
seen
above
the
trees
again.
It
was
a
few
minutes
past
nine
that
night
when
these
three
sentinels
were
joined
by
four
other
Martians,
each
carrying
a
thick
black
tube.
A
similar
tube
was
handed
to
each
of
the
three,
and
the
seven
proceeded
to
distribute
themselves
at
equal
distances
along
a
curved
line
between
St.
George's
Hill,
Weybridge,
and
the
village
of
Send,
southwest
of
Ripley.
A
dozen
rockets
sprang
out
of
the
hills
before
them
so
soon
as
they
began
to
move,
and
warned
the
waiting
batteries
about
Ditton
and
Esher.
At
the
same
time
four
of
their
fighting
machines,
similarly
armed
with
tubes,
crossed
the
river,
and
two
of
them,
black
against
the
western
sky,
came
into
sight
of
myself
and
the
curate
as
we
hurried
wearily
and
painfully
along
the
road
that
runs
northward
out
of
Halliford.
They
moved,
as
it
seemed
to
us,
upon
a
cloud,
for
a
milky
mist
covered
the
fields
and
rose
to
a
third
of
their
height.
At
this
sight
the
curate
cried
faintly
in
his
throat,
and
began
running;
but
I
knew
it
was
no
good
running
from
a
Martian,
and
I
turned
aside
and
crawled
through
dewy
nettles
and
brambles
into
the
broad
ditch
by
the
side
of
the
road.
He
looked
back,
saw
what
I
was
doing,
and
turned
to
join
me.
The
two
halted,
the
nearer
to
us
standing
and
facing
Sunbury,
the
remoter
being
a
grey
indistinctness
towards
the
evening
star,
away
towards
Staines.
The
occasional
howling
of
the
Martians
had
ceased;
they
took
up
their
positions
in
the
huge
crescent
about
their
cylinders
in
absolute
silence.
It
was
a
crescent
with
twelve
miles
between
its
horns.
Never
since
the
devising
of
gunpowder
was
the
beginning
of
a
battle
so
still.
To
us
and
to
an
observer
about
Ripley
it
would
have
had
precisely
the
same
effect--the
Martians
seemed
in
solitary
possession
of
the
darkling
night,
lit
only
as
it
was
by
the
slender
moon,
the
stars,
the
afterglow
of
the
daylight,
and
the
ruddy
glare
from
St.
George's
Hill
and
the
woods
of
Painshill.
But
facing
that
crescent
everywhere--at
Staines,
Hounslow,
Ditton,
Esher,
Ockham,
behind
hills
and
woods
south
of
the
river,
and
across
the
flat
grass
meadows
to
the
north
of
it,
wherever
a
cluster
of
trees
or
village
houses
gave
sufficient
cover--the
guns
were
waiting.
The
signal
rockets
burst
and
rained
their
sparks
through
the
night
and
vanished,
and
the
spirit
of
all
those
watching
batteries
rose
to
a
tense
expectation.
The
Martians
had
but
to
advance
into
the
line
of
fire,
and
instantly
those
motionless
black
forms
of
men,
those
guns
glittering
so
darkly
in
the
early
night,
would
explode
into
a
thunderous
fury
of
battle.
No
doubt
the
thought
that
was
uppermost
in
a
thousand
of
those
vigilant
minds,
even
as
it
was
uppermost
in
mine,
was
the
riddle--how
much
they
understood
of
us.
Did
they
grasp
that
we
in
our
millions
were
organized,
disciplined,
working
together?
Or
did
they
interpret
our
spurts
of
fire,
the
sudden
stinging
of
our
shells,
our
steady
investment
of
their
encampment,
as
we
should
the
furious
unanimity
of
onslaught
in
a
disturbed
hive
of
bees?
Did
they
dream
they
might
exterminate
us?
(At
that
time
no
one
knew
what
food
they
needed.)
A
hundred
such
questions
struggled
together
in
my
mind
as
I
watched
that
vast
sentinel
shape.
And
in
the
back
of
my
mind
was
the
sense
of
all
the
huge
unknown
and
hidden
forces
Londonward.
Had
they
prepared
pitfalls?
Were
the
powder
mills
at
Hounslow
ready
as
a
snare?
Would
the
Londoners
have
the
heart
and
courage
to
make
a
greater
Moscow
of
their
mighty
province
of
houses?
Then,
after
an
interminable
time,
as
it
seemed
to
us,
crouching
and
peering
through
the
hedge,
came
a
sound
like
the
distant
concussion
of
a
gun.
Another
nearer,
and
then
another.
And
then
the
Martian
beside
us
raised
his
tube
on
high
and
discharged
it,
gunwise,
with
a
heavy
report
that
made
the
ground
heave.
The
one
towards
Staines
answered
him.
There
was
no
flash,
no
smoke,
simply
that
loaded
detonation.
I
was
so
excited
by
these
heavy
minute-guns
following
one
another
that
I
so
far
forgot
my
personal
safety
and
my
scalded
hands
as
to
clamber
up
into
the
hedge
and
stare
towards
Sunbury.
As
I
did
so
a
second
report
followed,
and
a
big
projectile
hurtled
overhead
towards
Hounslow.
I
expected
at
least
to
see
smoke
or
fire,
or
some
such
evidence
of
its
work.
But
all
I
saw
was
the
deep
blue
sky
above,
with
one
solitary
star,
and
the
white
mist
spreading
wide
and
low
beneath.
And
there
had
been
no
crash,
no
answering
explosion.
The
silence
was
restored;
the
minute
lengthened
to
three.
"What
has
happened?"
said
the
curate,
standing
up
beside
me.
"Heaven
knows!"
said
I.
A
bat
flickered
by
and
vanished.
A
distant
tumult
of
shouting
began
and
ceased.
I
looked
again
at
the
Martian,
and
saw
he
was
now
moving
eastward
along
the
riverbank,
with
a
swift,
rolling
motion.
Every
moment
I
expected
the
fire
of
some
hidden
battery
to
spring
upon
him;
but
the
evening
calm
was
unbroken.
The
figure
of
the
Martian
grew
smaller
as
he
receded,
and
presently
the
mist
and
the
gathering
night
had
swallowed
him
up.
By
a
common
impulse
we
clambered
higher.
Towards
Sunbury
was
a
dark
appearance,
as
though
a
conical
hill
had
suddenly
come
into
being
there,
hiding
our
view
of
the
farther
country;
and
then,
remoter
across
the
river,
over
Walton,
we
saw
another
such
summit.
These
hill-like
forms
grew
lower
and
broader
even
as
we
stared.
Moved
by
a
sudden
thought,
I
looked
northward,
and
there
I
perceived
a
third
of
these
cloudy
black
kopjes
had
risen.
Everything
had
suddenly
become
very
still.
Far
away
to
the
southeast,
marking
the
quiet,
we
heard
the
Martians
hooting
to
one
another,
and
then
the
air
quivered
again
with
the
distant
thud
of
their
guns.
But
the
earthly
artillery
made
no
reply.
Now
at
the
time
we
could
not
understand
these
things,
but
later
I
was
to
learn
the
meaning
of
these
ominous
kopjes
that
gathered
in
the
twilight.
Each
of
the
Martians,
standing
in
the
great
crescent
I
have
described,
had
discharged,
by
means
of
the
gunlike
tube
he
carried,
a
huge
canister
over
whatever
hill,
copse,
cluster
of
houses,
or
other
possible
cover
for
guns,
chanced
to
be
in
front
of
him.
Some
fired
only
one
of
these,
some
two--as
in
the
case
of
the
one
we
had
seen;
the
one
at
Ripley
is
said
to
have
discharged
no
fewer
than
five
at
that
time.
These
canisters
smashed
on
striking
the
ground--they
did
not
explode--and
incontinently
disengaged
an
enormous
volume
of
heavy,
inky
vapour,
coiling
and
pouring
upward
in
a
huge
and
ebony
cumulus
cloud,
a
gaseous
hill
that
sank
and
spread
itself
slowly
over
the
surrounding
country.
And
the
touch
of
that
vapour,
the
inhaling
of
its
pungent
wisps,
was
death
to
all
that
breathes.
It
was
heavy,
this
vapour,
heavier
than
the
densest
smoke,
so
that,
after
the
first
tumultuous
uprush
and
outflow
of
its
impact,
it
sank
down
through
the
air
and
poured
over
the
ground
in
a
manner
rather
liquid
than
gaseous,
abandoning
the
hills,
and
streaming
into
the
valleys
and
ditches
and
watercourses
even
as
I
have
heard
the
carbonic-acid
gas
that
pours
from
volcanic
clefts
is
wont
to
do.
And
where
it
came
upon
water
some
chemical
action
occurred,
and
the
surface
would
be
instantly
covered
with
a
powdery
scum
that
sank
slowly
and
made
way
for
more.
The
scum
was
absolutely
insoluble,
and
it
is
a
strange
thing,
seeing
the
instant
effect
of
the
gas,
that
one
could
drink
without
hurt
the
water
from
which
it
had
been
strained.
The
vapour
did
not
diffuse
as
a
true
gas
would
do.
It
hung
together
in
banks,
flowing
sluggishly
down
the
slope
of
the
land
and
driving
reluctantly
before
the
wind,
and
very
slowly
it
combined
with
the
mist
and
moisture
of
the
air,
and
sank
to
the
earth
in
the
form
of
dust.
Save
that
an
unknown
element
giving
a
group
of
four
lines
in
the
blue
of
the
spectrum
is
concerned,
we
are
still
entirely
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
this
substance.
Once
the
tumultuous
upheaval
of
its
dispersion
was
over,
the
black
smoke
clung
so
closely
to
the
ground,
even
before
its
precipitation,
that
fifty
feet
up
in
the
air,
on
the
roofs
and
upper
stories
of
high
houses
and
on
great
trees,
there
was
a
chance
of
escaping
its
poison
altogether,
as
was
proved
even
that
night
at
Street
Cobham
and
Ditton.
The
man
who
escaped
at
the
former
place
tells
a
wonderful
story
of
the
strangeness
of
its
coiling
flow,
and
how
he
looked
down
from
the
church
spire
and
saw
the
houses
of
the
village
rising
like
ghosts
out
of
its
inky
nothingness.
For
a
day
and
a
half
he
remained
there,
weary,
starving
and
sun-scorched,
the
earth
under
the
blue
sky
and
against
the
prospect
of
the
distant
hills
a
velvet-black
expanse,
with
red
roofs,
green
trees,
and,
later,
black-veiled
shrubs
and
gates,
barns,
outhouses,
and
walls,
rising
here
and
there
into
the
sunlight.
But
that
was
at
Street
Cobham,
where
the
black
vapour
was
allowed
to
remain
until
it
sank
of
its
own
accord
into
the
ground.
As
a
rule
the
Martians,
when
it
had
served
its
purpose,
cleared
the
air
of
it
again
by
wading
into
it
and
directing
a
jet
of
steam
upon
it.
This
they
did
with
the
vapour
banks
near
us,
as
we
saw
in
the
starlight
from
the
window
of
a
deserted
house
at
Upper
Halliford,
whither
we
had
returned.
From
there
we
could
see
the
searchlights
on
Richmond
Hill
and
Kingston
Hill
going
to
and
fro,
and
about
eleven
the
windows
rattled,
and
we
heard
the
sound
of
the
huge
siege
guns
that
had
been
put
in
position
there.
These
continued
intermittently
for
the
space
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour,
sending
chance
shots
at
the
invisible
Martians
at
Hampton
and
Ditton,
and
then
the
pale
beams
of
the
electric
light
vanished,
and
were
replaced
by
a
bright
red
glow.
Then
the
fourth
cylinder
fell--a
brilliant
green
meteor--as
I
learned
afterwards,
in
Bushey
Park.
Before
the
guns
on
the
Richmond
and
Kingston
line
of
hills
began,
there
was
a
fitful
cannonade
far
away
in
the
southwest,
due,
I
believe,
to
guns
being
fired
haphazard
before
the
black
vapour
could
overwhelm
the
gunners.
So,
setting
about
it
as
methodically
as
men
might
smoke
out
a
wasps'
nest,
the
Martians
spread
this
strange
stifling
vapour
over
the
Londonward
country.
The
horns
of
the
crescent
slowly
moved
apart,
until
at
last
they
formed
a
line
from
Hanwell
to
Coombe
and
Malden.
All
night
through
their
destructive
tubes
advanced.
Never
once,
after
the
Martian
at
St.
George's
Hill
was
brought
down,
did
they
give
the
artillery
the
ghost
of
a
chance
against
them.
Wherever
there
was
a
possibility
of
guns
being
laid
for
them
unseen,
a
fresh
canister
of
the
black
vapour
was
discharged,
and
where
the
guns
were
openly
displayed
the
Heat-Ray
was
brought
to
bear.
By
midnight
the
blazing
trees
along
the
slopes
of
Richmond
Park
and
the
glare
of
Kingston
Hill
threw
their
light
upon
a
network
of
black
smoke,
blotting
out
the
whole
valley
of
the
Thames
and
extending
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach.
And
through
this
two
Martians
slowly
waded,
and
turned
their
hissing
steam
jets
this
way
and
that.
They
were
sparing
of
the
Heat-Ray
that
night,
either
because
they
had
but
a
limited
supply
of
material
for
its
production
or
because
they
did
not
wish
to
destroy
the
country
but
only
to
crush
and
overawe
the
opposition
they
had
aroused.
In
the
latter
aim
they
certainly
succeeded.
Sunday
night
was
the
end
of
the
organised
opposition
to
their
movements.
After
that
no
body
of
men
would
stand
against
them,
so
hopeless
was
the
enterprise.
Even
the
crews
of
the
torpedo-boats
and
destroyers
that
had
brought
their
quick-firers
up
the
Thames
refused
to
stop,
mutinied,
and
went
down
again.
The
only
offensive
operation
men
ventured
upon
after
that
night
was
the
preparation
of
mines
and
pitfalls,
and
even
in
that
their
energies
were
frantic
and
spasmodic.
One
has
to
imagine,
as
well
as
one
may,
the
fate
of
those
batteries
towards
Esher,
waiting
so
tensely
in
the
twilight.
Survivors
there
were
none.
One
may
picture
the
orderly
expectation,
the
officers
alert
and
watchful,
the
gunners
ready,
the
ammunition
piled
to
hand,
the
limber
gunners
with
their
horses
and
waggons,
the
groups
of
civilian
spectators
standing
as
near
as
they
were
permitted,
the
evening
stillness,
the
ambulances
and
hospital
tents
with
the
burned
and
wounded
from
Weybridge;
then
the
dull
resonance
of
the
shots
the
Martians
fired,
and
the
clumsy
projectile
whirling
over
the
trees
and
houses
and
smashing
amid
the
neighbouring
fields.
One
may
picture,
too,
the
sudden
shifting
of
the
attention,
the
swiftly
spreading
coils
and
bellyings
of
that
blackness
advancing
headlong,
towering
heavenward,
turning
the
twilight
to
a
palpable
darkness,
a
strange
and
horrible
antagonist
of
vapour
striding
upon
its
victims,
men
and
horses
near
it
seen
dimly,
running,
shrieking,
falling
headlong,
shouts
of
dismay,
the
guns
suddenly
abandoned,
men
choking
and
writhing
on
the
ground,
and
the
swift
broadening-out
of
the
opaque
cone
of
smoke.
And
then
night
and
extinction--nothing
but
a
silent
mass
of
impenetrable
vapour
hiding
its
dead.
Before
dawn
the
black
vapour
was
pouring
through
the
streets
of
Richmond,
and
the
disintegrating
organism
of
government
was,
with
a
last
expiring
effort,
rousing
the
population
of
London
to
the
necessity
of
flight.
CHAPTER
SIXTEEN
THE
EXODUS
FROM
LONDON
So
you
understand
the
roaring
wave
of
fear
that
swept
through
the
greatest
city
in
the
world
just
as
Monday
was
dawning--the
stream
of
flight
rising
swiftly
to
a
torrent,
lashing
in
a
foaming
tumult
round
the
railway
stations,
banked
up
into
a
horrible
struggle
about
the
shipping
in
the
Thames,
and
hurrying
by
every
available
channel
northward
and
eastward.
By
ten
o'clock
the
police
organisation,
and
by
midday
even
the
railway
organisations,
were
losing
coherency,
losing
shape
and
efficiency,
guttering,
softening,
running
at
last
in
that
swift
liquefaction
of
the
social
body.
All
the
railway
lines
north
of
the
Thames
and
the
South-Eastern
people
at
Cannon
Street
had
been
warned
by
midnight
on
Sunday,
and
trains
were
being
filled.
People
were
fighting
savagely
for
standing-room
in
the
carriages
even
at
two
o'clock.
By
three,
people
were
being
trampled
and
crushed
even
in
Bishopsgate
Street,
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
or
more
from
Liverpool
Street
station;
revolvers
were
fired,
people
stabbed,
and
the
policemen
who
had
been
sent
to
direct
the
traffic,
exhausted
and
infuriated,
were
breaking
the
heads
of
the
people
they
were
called
out
to
protect.
And
as
the
day
advanced
and
the
engine
drivers
and
stokers
refused
to
return
to
London,
the
pressure
of
the
flight
drove
the
people
in
an
ever-thickening
multitude
away
from
the
stations
and
along
the
northward-running
roads.
By
midday
a
Martian
had
been
seen
at
Barnes,
and
a
cloud
of
slowly
sinking
black
vapour
drove
along
the
Thames
and
across
the
flats
of
Lambeth,
cutting
off
all
escape
over
the
bridges
in
its
sluggish
advance.
Another
bank
drove
over
Ealing,
and
surrounded
a
little
island
of
survivors
on
Castle
Hill,
alive,
but
unable
to
escape.
After
a
fruitless
struggle
to
get
aboard
a
North-Western
train
at
Chalk
Farm--the
engines
of
the
trains
that
had
loaded
in
the
goods
yard
there
_ploughed_
through
shrieking
people,
and
a
dozen
stalwart
men
fought
to
keep
the
crowd
from
crushing
the
driver
against
his
furnace--my
brother
emerged
upon
the
Chalk
Farm
road,
dodged
across
through
a
hurrying
swarm
of
vehicles,
and
had
the
luck
to
be
foremost
in
the
sack
of
a
cycle
shop.
The
front
tire
of
the
machine
he
got
was
punctured
in
dragging
it
through
the
window,
but
he
got
up
and
off,
notwithstanding,
with
no
further
injury
than
a
cut
wrist.
The
steep
foot
of
Haverstock
Hill
was
impassable
owing
to
several
overturned
horses,
and
my
brother
struck
into
Belsize
Road.
So
he
got
out
of
the
fury
of
the
panic,
and,
skirting
the
Edgware
Road,
reached
Edgware
about
seven,
fasting
and
wearied,
but
well
ahead
of
the
crowd.
Along
the
road
people
were
standing
in
the
roadway,
curious,
wondering.
He
was
passed
by
a
number
of
cyclists,
some
horsemen,
and
two
motor
cars.
A
mile
from
Edgware
the
rim
of
the
wheel
broke,
and
the
machine
became
unridable.
He
left
it
by
the
roadside
and
trudged
through
the
village.
There
were
shops
half
opened
in
the
main
street
of
the
place,
and
people
crowded
on
the
pavement
and
in
the
doorways
and
windows,
staring
astonished
at
this
extraordinary
procession
of
fugitives
that
was
beginning.
He
succeeded
in
getting
some
food
at
an
inn.
For
a
time
he
remained
in
Edgware
not
knowing
what
next
to
do.
The
flying
people
increased
in
number.
Many
of
them,
like
my
brother,
seemed
inclined
to
loiter
in
the
place.
There
was
no
fresh
news
of
the
invaders
from
Mars.
At
that
time
the
road
was
crowded,
but
as
yet
far
from
congested.
Most
of
the
fugitives
at
that
hour
were
mounted
on
cycles,
but
there
were
soon
motor
cars,
hansom
cabs,
and
carriages
hurrying
along,
and
the
dust
hung
in
heavy
clouds
along
the
road
to
St.
Albans.
It
was
perhaps
a
vague
idea
of
making
his
way
to
Chelmsford,
where
some
friends
of
his
lived,
that
at
last
induced
my
brother
to
strike
into
a
quiet
lane
running
eastward.
Presently
he
came
upon
a
stile,
and,
crossing
it,
followed
a
footpath
northeastward.
He
passed
near
several
farmhouses
and
some
little
places
whose
names
he
did
not
learn.
He
saw
few
fugitives
until,
in
a
grass
lane
towards
High
Barnet,
he
happened
upon
two
ladies
who
became
his
fellow
travellers.
He
came
upon
them
just
in
time
to
save
them.
He
heard
their
screams,
and,
hurrying
round
the
corner,
saw
a
couple
of
men
struggling
to
drag
them
out
of
the
little
pony-chaise
in
which
they
had
been
driving,
while
a
third
with
difficulty
held
the
frightened
pony's
head.
One
of
the
ladies,
a
short
woman
dressed
in
white,
was
simply
screaming;
the
other,
a
dark,
slender
figure,
slashed
at
the
man
who
gripped
her
arm
with
a
whip
she
held
in
her
disengaged
hand.
My
brother
immediately
grasped
the
situation,
shouted,
and
hurried
towards
the
struggle.
One
of
the
men
desisted
and
turned
towards
him,
and
my
brother,
realising
from
his
antagonist's
face
that
a
fight
was
unavoidable,
and
being
an
expert
boxer,
went
into
him
forthwith
and
sent
him
down
against
the
wheel
of
the
chaise.
It
was
no
time
for
pugilistic
chivalry
and
my
brother
laid
him
quiet
with
a
kick,
and
gripped
the
collar
of
the
man
who
pulled
at
the
slender
lady's
arm.
He
heard
the
clatter
of
hoofs,
the
whip
stung
across
his
face,
a
third
antagonist
struck
him
between
the
eyes,
and
the
man
he
held
wrenched
himself
free
and
made
off
down
the
lane
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
come.
Partly
stunned,
he
found
himself
facing
the
man
who
had
held
the
horse's
head,
and
became
aware
of
the
chaise
receding
from
him
down
the
lane,
swaying
from
side
to
side,
and
with
the
women
in
it
looking
back.
The
man
before
him,
a
burly
rough,
tried
to
close,
and
he
stopped
him
with
a
blow
in
the
face.
Then,
realising
that
he
was
deserted,
he
dodged
round
and
made
off
down
the
lane
after
the
chaise,
with
the
sturdy
man
close
behind
him,
and
the
fugitive,
who
had
turned
now,
following
remotely.
Suddenly
he
stumbled
and
fell;
his
immediate
pursuer
went
headlong,
and
he
rose
to
his
feet
to
find
himself
with
a
couple
of
antagonists
again.
He
would
have
had
little
chance
against
them
had
not
the
slender
lady
very
pluckily
pulled
up
and
returned
to
his
help.
It
seems
she
had
had
a
revolver
all
this
time,
but
it
had
been
under
the
seat
when
she
and
her
companion
were
attacked.
She
fired
at
six
yards'
distance,
narrowly
missing
my
brother.
The
less
courageous
of
the
robbers
made
off,
and
his
companion
followed
him,
cursing
his
cowardice.
They
both
stopped
in
sight
down
the
lane,
where
the
third
man
lay
insensible.
"Take
this!"
said
the
slender
lady,
and
she
gave
my
brother
her
revolver.
"Go
back
to
the
chaise,"
said
my
brother,
wiping
the
blood
from
his
split
lip.
She
turned
without
a
word--they
were
both
panting--and
they
went
back
to
where
the
lady
in
white
struggled
to
hold
back
the
frightened
pony.
The
robbers
had
evidently
had
enough
of
it.
When
my
brother
looked
again
they
were
retreating.
"I'll
sit
here,"
said
my
brother,
"if
I
may";
and
he
got
upon
the
empty
front
seat.
The
lady
looked
over
her
shoulder.
"Give
me
the
reins,"
she
said,
and
laid
the
whip
along
the
pony's
side.
In
another
moment
a
bend
in
the
road
hid
the
three
men
from
my
brother's
eyes.
So,
quite
unexpectedly,
my
brother
found
himself,
panting,
with
a
cut
mouth,
a
bruised
jaw,
and
bloodstained
knuckles,
driving
along
an
unknown
lane
with
these
two
women.
He
learned
they
were
the
wife
and
the
younger
sister
of
a
surgeon
living
at
Stanmore,
who
had
come
in
the
small
hours
from
a
dangerous
case
at
Pinner,
and
heard
at
some
railway
station
on
his
way
of
the
Martian
advance.
He
had
hurried
home,
roused
the
women--their
servant
had
left
them
two
days
before--packed
some
provisions,
put
his
revolver
under
the
seat--luckily
for
my
brother--and
told
them
to
drive
on
to
Edgware,
with
the
idea
of
getting
a
train
there.
He
stopped
behind
to
tell
the
neighbours.
He
would
overtake
them,
he
said,
at
about
half
past
four
in
the
morning,
and
now
it
was
nearly
nine
and
they
had
seen
nothing
of
him.
They
could
not
stop
in
Edgware
because
of
the
growing
traffic
through
the
place,
and
so
they
had
come
into
this
side
lane.
That
was
the
story
they
told
my
brother
in
fragments
when
presently
they
stopped
again,
nearer
to
New
Barnet.
He
promised
to
stay
with
them,
at
least
until
they
could
determine
what
to
do,
or
until
the
missing
man
arrived,
and
professed
to
be
an
expert
shot
with
the
revolver--a
weapon
strange
to
him--in
order
to
give
them
confidence.
They
made
a
sort
of
encampment
by
the
wayside,
and
the
pony
became
happy
in
the
hedge.
He
told
them
of
his
own
escape
out
of
London,
and
all
that
he
knew
of
these
Martians
and
their
ways.
The
sun
crept
higher
in
the
sky,
and
after
a
time
their
talk
died
out
and
gave
place
to
an
uneasy
state
of
anticipation.
Several
wayfarers
came
along
the
lane,
and
of
these
my
brother
gathered
such
news
as
he
could.
Every
broken
answer
he
had
deepened
his
impression
of
the
great
disaster
that
had
come
on
humanity,
deepened
his
persuasion
of
the
immediate
necessity
for
prosecuting
this
flight.
He
urged
the
matter
upon
them.
"We
have
money,"
said
the
slender
woman,
and
hesitated.
Her
eyes
met
my
brother's,
and
her
hesitation
ended.
"So
have
I,"
said
my
brother.
She
explained
that
they
had
as
much
as
thirty
pounds
in
gold,
besides
a
five-pound
note,
and
suggested
that
with
that
they
might
get
upon
a
train
at
St.
Albans
or
New
Barnet.
My
brother
thought
that
was
hopeless,
seeing
the
fury
of
the
Londoners
to
crowd
upon
the
trains,
and
broached
his
own
idea
of
striking
across
Essex
towards
Harwich
and
thence
escaping
from
the
country
altogether.
Mrs.
Elphinstone--that
was
the
name
of
the
woman
in
white--would
listen
to
no
reasoning,
and
kept
calling
upon
"George";
but
her
sister-in-law
was
astonishingly
quiet
and
deliberate,
and
at
last
agreed
to
my
brother's
suggestion.
So,
designing
to
cross
the
Great
North
Road,
they
went
on
towards
Barnet,
my
brother
leading
the
pony
to
save
it
as
much
as
possible.
As
the
sun
crept
up
the
sky
the
day
became
excessively
hot,
and
under
foot
a
thick,
whitish
sand
grew
burning
and
blinding,
so
that
they
travelled
only
very
slowly.
The
hedges
were
grey
with
dust.
And
as
they
advanced
towards
Barnet
a
tumultuous
murmuring
grew
stronger.
They
began
to
meet
more
people.
For
the
most
part
these
were
staring
before
them,
murmuring
indistinct
questions,
jaded,
haggard,
unclean.
One
man
in
evening
dress
passed
them
on
foot,
his
eyes
on
the
ground.
They
heard
his
voice,
and,
looking
back
at
him,
saw
one
hand
clutched
in
his
hair
and
the
other
beating
invisible
things.
His
paroxysm
of
rage
over,
he
went
on
his
way
without
once
looking
back.
As
my
brother's
party
went
on
towards
the
crossroads
to
the
south
of
Barnet
they
saw
a
woman
approaching
the
road
across
some
fields
on
their
left,
carrying
a
child
and
with
two
other
children;
and
then
passed
a
man
in
dirty
black,
with
a
thick
stick
in
one
hand
and
a
small
portmanteau
in
the
other.
Then
round
the
corner
of
the
lane,
from
between
the
villas
that
guarded
it
at
its
confluence
with
the
high
road,
came
a
little
cart
drawn
by
a
sweating
black
pony
and
driven
by
a
sallow
youth
in
a
bowler
hat,
grey
with
dust.
There
were
three
girls,
East
End
factory
girls,
and
a
couple
of
little
children
crowded
in
the
cart.
"This'll
tike
us
rahnd
Edgware?"
asked
the
driver,
wild-eyed,
white-faced;
and
when
my
brother
told
him
it
would
if
he
turned
to
the
left,
he
whipped
up
at
once
without
the
formality
of
thanks.
My
brother
noticed
a
pale
grey
smoke
or
haze
rising
among
the
houses
in
front
of
them,
and
veiling
the
white
facade
of
a
terrace
beyond
the
road
that
appeared
between
the
backs
of
the
villas.
Mrs.
Elphinstone
suddenly
cried
out
at
a
number
of
tongues
of
smoky
red
flame
leaping
up
above
the
houses
in
front
of
them
against
the
hot,
blue
sky.
The
tumultuous
noise
resolved
itself
now
into
the
disorderly
mingling
of
many
voices,
the
gride
of
many
wheels,
the
creaking
of
waggons,
and
the
staccato
of
hoofs.
The
lane
came
round
sharply
not
fifty
yards
from
the
crossroads.
"Good
heavens!"
cried
Mrs.
Elphinstone.
"What
is
this
you
are
driving
us
into?"
My
brother
stopped.
For
the
main
road
was
a
boiling
stream
of
people,
a
torrent
of
human
beings
rushing
northward,
one
pressing
on
another.
A
great
bank
of
dust,
white
and
luminous
in
the
blaze
of
the
sun,
made
everything
within
twenty
feet
of
the
ground
grey
and
indistinct
and
was
perpetually
renewed
by
the
hurrying
feet
of
a
dense
crowd
of
horses
and
of
men
and
women
on
foot,
and
by
the
wheels
of
vehicles
of
every
description.
"Way!"
my
brother
heard
voices
crying.
"Make
way!"
It
was
like
riding
into
the
smoke
of
a
fire
to
approach
the
meeting
point
of
the
lane
and
road;
the
crowd
roared
like
a
fire,
and
the
dust
was
hot
and
pungent.
And,
indeed,
a
little
way
up
the
road
a
villa
was
burning
and
sending
rolling
masses
of
black
smoke
across
the
road
to
add
to
the
confusion.
Two
men
came
past
them.
Then
a
dirty
woman,
carrying
a
heavy
bundle
and
weeping.
A
lost
retriever
dog,
with
hanging
tongue,
circled
dubiously
round
them,
scared
and
wretched,
and
fled
at
my
brother's
threat.
So
much
as
they
could
see
of
the
road
Londonward
between
the
houses
to
the
right
was
a
tumultuous
stream
of
dirty,
hurrying
people,
pent
in
between
the
villas
on
either
side;
the
black
heads,
the
crowded
forms,
grew
into
distinctness
as
they
rushed
towards
the
corner,
hurried
past,
and
merged
their
individuality
again
in
a
receding
multitude
that
was
swallowed
up
at
last
in
a
cloud
of
dust.
"Go
on!
Go
on!"
cried
the
voices.
"Way!
Way!"
One
man's
hands
pressed
on
the
back
of
another.
My
brother
stood
at
the
pony's
head.
Irresistibly
attracted,
he
advanced
slowly,
pace
by
pace,
down
the
lane.
Edgware
had
been
a
scene
of
confusion,
Chalk
Farm
a
riotous
tumult,
but
this
was
a
whole
population
in
movement.
It
is
hard
to
imagine
that
host.
It
had
no
character
of
its
own.
The
figures
poured
out
past
the
corner,
and
receded
with
their
backs
to
the
group
in
the
lane.
Along
the
margin
came
those
who
were
on
foot
threatened
by
the
wheels,
stumbling
in
the
ditches,
blundering
into
one
another.
The
carts
and
carriages
crowded
close
upon
one
another,
making
little
way
for
those
swifter
and
more
impatient
vehicles
that
darted
forward
every
now
and
then
when
an
opportunity
showed
itself
of
doing
so,
sending
the
people
scattering
against
the
fences
and
gates
of
the
villas.
"Push
on!"
was
the
cry.
"Push
on!
They
are
coming!"
In
one
cart
stood
a
blind
man
in
the
uniform
of
the
Salvation
Army,
gesticulating
with
his
crooked
fingers
and
bawling,
"Eternity!
Eternity!"
His
voice
was
hoarse
and
very
loud
so
that
my
brother
could
hear
him
long
after
he
was
lost
to
sight
in
the
dust.
Some
of
the
people
who
crowded
in
the
carts
whipped
stupidly
at
their
horses
and
quarrelled
with
other
drivers;
some
sat
motionless,
staring
at
nothing
with
miserable
eyes;
some
gnawed
their
hands
with
thirst,
or
lay
prostrate
in
the
bottoms
of
their
conveyances.
The
horses'
bits
were
covered
with
foam,
their
eyes
bloodshot.
There
were
cabs,
carriages,
shop
cars,
waggons,
beyond
counting;
a
mail
cart,
a
road-cleaner's
cart
marked
"Vestry
of
St.
Pancras,"
a
huge
timber
waggon
crowded
with
roughs.
A
brewer's
dray
rumbled
by
with
its
two
near
wheels
splashed
with
fresh
blood.
"Clear
the
way!"
cried
the
voices.
"Clear
the
way!"
"Eter-nity!
Eter-nity!"
came
echoing
down
the
road.
There
were
sad,
haggard
women
tramping
by,
well
dressed,
with
children
that
cried
and
stumbled,
their
dainty
clothes
smothered
in
dust,
their
weary
faces
smeared
with
tears.
With
many
of
these
came
men,
sometimes
helpful,
sometimes
lowering
and
savage.
Fighting
side
by
side
with
them
pushed
some
weary
street
outcast
in
faded
black
rags,
wide-eyed,
loud-voiced,
and
foul-mouthed.
There
were
sturdy
workmen
thrusting
their
way
along,
wretched,
unkempt
men,
clothed
like
clerks
or
shopmen,
struggling
spasmodically;
a
wounded
soldier
my
brother
noticed,
men
dressed
in
the
clothes
of
railway
porters,
one
wretched
creature
in
a
nightshirt
with
a
coat
thrown
over
it.
But
varied
as
its
composition
was,
certain
things
all
that
host
had
in
common.
There
were
fear
and
pain
on
their
faces,
and
fear
behind
them.
A
tumult
up
the
road,
a
quarrel
for
a
place
in
a
waggon,
sent
the
whole
host
of
them
quickening
their
pace;
even
a
man
so
scared
and
broken
that
his
knees
bent
under
him
was
galvanised
for
a
moment
into
renewed
activity.
The
heat
and
dust
had
already
been
at
work
upon
this
multitude.
Their
skins
were
dry,
their
lips
black
and
cracked.
They
were
all
thirsty,
weary,
and
footsore.
And
amid
the
various
cries
one
heard
disputes,
reproaches,
groans
of
weariness
and
fatigue;
the
voices
of
most
of
them
were
hoarse
and
weak.
Through
it
all
ran
a
refrain:
"Way!
Way!
The
Martians
are
coming!"
Few
stopped
and
came
aside
from
that
flood.
The
lane
opened
slantingly
into
the
main
road
with
a
narrow
opening,
and
had
a
delusive
appearance
of
coming
from
the
direction
of
London.
Yet
a
kind
of
eddy
of
people
drove
into
its
mouth;
weaklings
elbowed
out
of
the
stream,
who
for
the
most
part
rested
but
a
moment
before
plunging
into
it
again.
A
little
way
down
the
lane,
with
two
friends
bending
over
him,
lay
a
man
with
a
bare
leg,
wrapped
about
with
bloody
rags.
He
was
a
lucky
man
to
have
friends.
A
little
old
man,
with
a
grey
military
moustache
and
a
filthy
black
frock
coat,
limped
out
and
sat
down
beside
the
trap,
removed
his
boot--his
sock
was
blood-stained--shook
out
a
pebble,
and
hobbled
on
again;
and
then
a
little
girl
of
eight
or
nine,
all
alone,
threw
herself
under
the
hedge
close
by
my
brother,
weeping.
"I
can't
go
on!
I
can't
go
on!"
My
brother
woke
from
his
torpor
of
astonishment
and
lifted
her
up,
speaking
gently
to
her,
and
carried
her
to
Miss
Elphinstone.
So
soon
as
my
brother
touched
her
she
became
quite
still,
as
if
frightened.
"Ellen!"
shrieked
a
woman
in
the
crowd,
with
tears
in
her
voice--"Ellen!"
And
the
child
suddenly
darted
away
from
my
brother,
crying
"Mother!"
"They
are
coming,"
said
a
man
on
horseback,
riding
past
along
the
lane.
"Out
of
the
way,
there!"
bawled
a
coachman,
towering
high;
and
my
brother
saw
a
closed
carriage
turning
into
the
lane.
The
people
crushed
back
on
one
another
to
avoid
the
horse.
My
brother
pushed
the
pony
and
chaise
back
into
the
hedge,
and
the
man
drove
by
and
stopped
at
the
turn
of
the
way.
It
was
a
carriage,
with
a
pole
for
a
pair
of
horses,
but
only
one
was
in
the
traces.
My
brother
saw
dimly
through
the
dust
that
two
men
lifted
out
something
on
a
white
stretcher
and
put
it
gently
on
the
grass
beneath
the
privet
hedge.
One
of
the
men
came
running
to
my
brother.
"Where
is
there
any
water?"
he
said.
"He
is
dying
fast,
and
very
thirsty.
It
is
Lord
Garrick."
"Lord
Garrick!"
said
my
brother;
"the
Chief
Justice?"
"The
water?"
he
said.
"There
may
be
a
tap,"
said
my
brother,
"in
some
of
the
houses.
We
have
no
water.
I
dare
not
leave
my
people."
The
man
pushed
against
the
crowd
towards
the
gate
of
the
corner
house.
"Go
on!"
said
the
people,
thrusting
at
him.
"They
are
coming!
Go
on!"
Then
my
brother's
attention
was
distracted
by
a
bearded,
eagle-faced
man
lugging
a
small
handbag,
which
split
even
as
my
brother's
eyes
rested
on
it
and
disgorged
a
mass
of
sovereigns
that
seemed
to
break
up
into
separate
coins
as
it
struck
the
ground.
They
rolled
hither
and
thither
among
the
struggling
feet
of
men
and
horses.
The
man
stopped
and
looked
stupidly
at
the
heap,
and
the
shaft
of
a
cab
struck
his
shoulder
and
sent
him
reeling.
He
gave
a
shriek
and
dodged
back,
and
a
cartwheel
shaved
him
narrowly.
"Way!"
cried
the
men
all
about
him.
"Make
way!"
So
soon
as
the
cab
had
passed,
he
flung
himself,
with
both
hands
open,
upon
the
heap
of
coins,
and
began
thrusting
handfuls
in
his
pocket.
A
horse
rose
close
upon
him,
and
in
another
moment,
half
rising,
he
had
been
borne
down
under
the
horse's
hoofs.
"Stop!"
screamed
my
brother,
and
pushing
a
woman
out
of
his
way,
tried
to
clutch
the
bit
of
the
horse.
Before
he
could
get
to
it,
he
heard
a
scream
under
the
wheels,
and
saw
through
the
dust
the
rim
passing
over
the
poor
wretch's
back.
The
driver
of
the
cart
slashed
his
whip
at
my
brother,
who
ran
round
behind
the
cart.
The
multitudinous
shouting
confused
his
ears.
The
man
was
writhing
in
the
dust
among
his
scattered
money,
unable
to
rise,
for
the
wheel
had
broken
his
back,
and
his
lower
limbs
lay
limp
and
dead.
My
brother
stood
up
and
yelled
at
the
next
driver,
and
a
man
on
a
black
horse
came
to
his
assistance.
"Get
him
out
of
the
road,"
said
he;
and,
clutching
the
man's
collar
with
his
free
hand,
my
brother
lugged
him
sideways.
But
he
still
clutched
after
his
money,
and
regarded
my
brother
fiercely,
hammering
at
his
arm
with
a
handful
of
gold.
"Go
on!
Go
on!"
shouted
angry
voices
behind.
"Way!
Way!"
There
was
a
smash
as
the
pole
of
a
carriage
crashed
into
the
cart
that
the
man
on
horseback
stopped.
My
brother
looked
up,
and
the
man
with
the
gold
twisted
his
head
round
and
bit
the
wrist
that
held
his
collar.
There
was
a
concussion,
and
the
black
horse
came
staggering
sideways,
and
the
carthorse
pushed
beside
it.
A
hoof
missed
my
brother's
foot
by
a
hair's
breadth.
He
released
his
grip
on
the
fallen
man
and
jumped
back.
He
saw
anger
change
to
terror
on
the
face
of
the
poor
wretch
on
the
ground,
and
in
a
moment
he
was
hidden
and
my
brother
was
borne
backward
and
carried
past
the
entrance
of
the
lane,
and
had
to
fight
hard
in
the
torrent
to
recover
it.
He
saw
Miss
Elphinstone
covering
her
eyes,
and
a
little
child,
with
all
a
child's
want
of
sympathetic
imagination,
staring
with
dilated
eyes
at
a
dusty
something
that
lay
black
and
still,
ground
and
crushed
under
the
rolling
wheels.
"Let
us
go
back!"
he
shouted,
and
began
turning
the
pony
round.
"We
cannot
cross
this--hell,"
he
said
and
they
went
back
a
hundred
yards
the
way
they
had
come,
until
the
fighting
crowd
was
hidden.
As
they
passed
the
bend
in
the
lane
my
brother
saw
the
face
of
the
dying
man
in
the
ditch
under
the
privet,
deadly
white
and
drawn,
and
shining
with
perspiration.
The
two
women
sat
silent,
crouching
in
their
seat
and
shivering.
Then
beyond
the
bend
my
brother
stopped
again.
Miss
Elphinstone
was
white
and
pale,
and
her
sister-in-law
sat
weeping,
too
wretched
even
to
call
upon
"George."
My
brother
was
horrified
and
perplexed.
So
soon
as
they
had
retreated
he
realised
how
urgent
and
unavoidable
it
was
to
attempt
this
crossing.
He
turned
to
Miss
Elphinstone,
suddenly
resolute.
"We
must
go
that
way,"
he
said,
and
led
the
pony
round
again.
For
the
second
time
that
day
this
girl
proved
her
quality.
To
force
their
way
into
the
torrent
of
people,
my
brother
plunged
into
the
traffic
and
held
back
a
cab
horse,
while
she
drove
the
pony
across
its
head.
A
waggon
locked
wheels
for
a
moment
and
ripped
a
long
splinter
from
the
chaise.
In
another
moment
they
were
caught
and
swept
forward
by
the
stream.
My
brother,
with
the
cabman's
whip
marks
red
across
his
face
and
hands,
scrambled
into
the
chaise
and
took
the
reins
from
her.
"Point
the
revolver
at
the
man
behind,"
he
said,
giving
it
to
her,
"if
he
presses
us
too
hard.
No!--point
it
at
his
horse."
Then
he
began
to
look
out
for
a
chance
of
edging
to
the
right
across
the
road.
But
once
in
the
stream
he
seemed
to
lose
volition,
to
become
a
part
of
that
dusty
rout.
They
swept
through
Chipping
Barnet
with
the
torrent;
they
were
nearly
a
mile
beyond
the
centre
of
the
town
before
they
had
fought
across
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
way.
It
was
din
and
confusion
indescribable;
but
in
and
beyond
the
town
the
road
forks
repeatedly,
and
this
to
some
extent
relieved
the
stress.
They
struck
eastward
through
Hadley,
and
there
on
either
side
of
the
road,
and
at
another
place
farther
on
they
came
upon
a
great
multitude
of
people
drinking
at
the
stream,
some
fighting
to
come
at
the
water.
And
farther
on,
from
a
lull
near
East
Barnet,
they
saw
two
trains
running
slowly
one
after
the
other
without
signal
or
order--trains
swarming
with
people,
with
men
even
among
the
coals
behind
the
engines--going
northward
along
the
Great
Northern
Railway.
My
brother
supposes
they
must
have
filled
outside
London,
for
at
that
time
the
furious
terror
of
the
people
had
rendered
the
central
termini
impossible.
Near
this
place
they
halted
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon,
for
the
violence
of
the
day
had
already
utterly
exhausted
all
three
of
them.
They
began
to
suffer
the
beginnings
of
hunger;
the
night
was
cold,
and
none
of
them
dared
to
sleep.
And
in
the
evening
many
people
came
hurrying
along
the
road
nearby
their
stopping
place,
fleeing
from
unknown
dangers
before
them,
and
going
in
the
direction
from
which
my
brother
had
come.
CHAPTER
SEVENTEEN
THE
"THUNDER
CHILD"
Had
the
Martians
aimed
only
at
destruction,
they
might
on
Monday
have
annihilated
the
entire
population
of
London,
as
it
spread
itself
slowly
through
the
home
counties.
Not
only
along
the
road
through
Barnet,
but
also
through
Edgware
and
Waltham
Abbey,
and
along
the
roads
eastward
to
Southend
and
Shoeburyness,
and
south
of
the
Thames
to
Deal
and
Broadstairs,
poured
the
same
frantic
rout.
If
one
could
have
hung
that
June
morning
in
a
balloon
in
the
blazing
blue
above
London
every
northward
and
eastward
road
running
out
of
the
tangled
maze
of
streets
would
have
seemed
stippled
black
with
the
streaming
fugitives,
each
dot
a
human
agony
of
terror
and
physical
distress.
I
have
set
forth
at
length
in
the
last
chapter
my
brother's
account
of
the
road
through
Chipping
Barnet,
in
order
that
my
readers
may
realise
how
that
swarming
of
black
dots
appeared
to
one
of
those
concerned.
Never
before
in
the
history
of
the
world
had
such
a
mass
of
human
beings
moved
and
suffered
together.
The
legendary
hosts
of
Goths
and
Huns,
the
hugest
armies
Asia
has
ever
seen,
would
have
been
but
a
drop
in
that
current.
And
this
was
no
disciplined
march;
it
was
a
stampede--a
stampede
gigantic
and
terrible--without
order
and
without
a
goal,
six
million
people
unarmed
and
unprovisioned,
driving
headlong.
It
was
the
beginning
of
the
rout
of
civilisation,
of
the
massacre
of
mankind.
Directly
below
him
the
balloonist
would
have
seen
the
network
of
streets
far
and
wide,
houses,
churches,
squares,
crescents,
gardens--already
derelict--spread
out
like
a
huge
map,
and
in
the
southward
_blotted_.
Over
Ealing,
Richmond,
Wimbledon,
it
would
have
seemed
as
if
some
monstrous
pen
had
flung
ink
upon
the
chart.
Steadily,
incessantly,
each
black
splash
grew
and
spread,
shooting
out
ramifications
this
way
and
that,
now
banking
itself
against
rising
ground,
now
pouring
swiftly
over
a
crest
into
a
new-found
valley,
exactly
as
a
gout
of
ink
would
spread
itself
upon
blotting
paper.
And
beyond,
over
the
blue
hills
that
rise
southward
of
the
river,
the
glittering
Martians
went
to
and
fro,
calmly
and
methodically
spreading
their
poison
cloud
over
this
patch
of
country
and
then
over
that,
laying
it
again
with
their
steam
jets
when
it
had
served
its
purpose,
and
taking
possession
of
the
conquered
country.
They
do
not
seem
to
have
aimed
at
extermination
so
much
as
at
complete
demoralisation
and
the
destruction
of
any
opposition.
They
exploded
any
stores
of
powder
they
came
upon,
cut
every
telegraph,
and
wrecked
the
railways
here
and
there.
They
were
hamstringing
mankind.
They
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
extend
the
field
of
their
operations,
and
did
not
come
beyond
the
central
part
of
London
all
that
day.
It
is
possible
that
a
very
considerable
number
of
people
in
London
stuck
to
their
houses
through
Monday
morning.
Certain
it
is
that
many
died
at
home
suffocated
by
the
Black
Smoke.
Until
about
midday
the
Pool
of
London
was
an
astonishing
scene.
Steamboats
and
shipping
of
all
sorts
lay
there,
tempted
by
the
enormous
sums
of
money
offered
by
fugitives,
and
it
is
said
that
many
who
swam
out
to
these
vessels
were
thrust
off
with
boathooks
and
drowned.
About
one
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
the
thinning
remnant
of
a
cloud
of
the
black
vapour
appeared
between
the
arches
of
Blackfriars
Bridge.
At
that
the
Pool
became
a
scene
of
mad
confusion,
fighting,
and
collision,
and
for
some
time
a
multitude
of
boats
and
barges
jammed
in
the
northern
arch
of
the
Tower
Bridge,
and
the
sailors
and
lightermen
had
to
fight
savagely
against
the
people
who
swarmed
upon
them
from
the
riverfront.
People
were
actually
clambering
down
the
piers
of
the
bridge
from
above.
When,
an
hour
later,
a
Martian
appeared
beyond
the
Clock
Tower
and
waded
down
the
river,
nothing
but
wreckage
floated
above
Limehouse.
Of
the
falling
of
the
fifth
cylinder
I
have
presently
to
tell.
The
sixth
star
fell
at
Wimbledon.
My
brother,
keeping
watch
beside
the
women
in
the
chaise
in
a
meadow,
saw
the
green
flash
of
it
far
beyond
the
hills.
On
Tuesday
the
little
party,
still
set
upon
getting
across
the
sea,
made
its
way
through
the
swarming
country
towards
Colchester.
The
news
that
the
Martians
were
now
in
possession
of
the
whole
of
London
was
confirmed.
They
had
been
seen
at
Highgate,
and
even,
it
was
said,
at
Neasden.
But
they
did
not
come
into
my
brother's
view
until
the
morrow.
That
day
the
scattered
multitudes
began
to
realise
the
urgent
need
of
provisions.
As
they
grew
hungry
the
rights
of
property
ceased
to
be
regarded.
Farmers
were
out
to
defend
their
cattle-sheds,
granaries,
and
ripening
root
crops
with
arms
in
their
hands.
A
number
of
people
now,
like
my
brother,
had
their
faces
eastward,
and
there
were
some
desperate
souls
even
going
back
towards
London
to
get
food.
These
were
chiefly
people
from
the
northern
suburbs,
whose
knowledge
of
the
Black
Smoke
came
by
hearsay.
He
heard
that
about
half
the
members
of
the
government
had
gathered
at
Birmingham,
and
that
enormous
quantities
of
high
explosives
were
being
prepared
to
be
used
in
automatic
mines
across
the
Midland
counties.
He
was
also
told
that
the
Midland
Railway
Company
had
replaced
the
desertions
of
the
first
day's
panic,
had
resumed
traffic,
and
was
running
northward
trains
from
St.
Albans
to
relieve
the
congestion
of
the
home
counties.
There
was
also
a
placard
in
Chipping
Ongar
announcing
that
large
stores
of
flour
were
available
in
the
northern
towns
and
that
within
twenty-four
hours
bread
would
be
distributed
among
the
starving
people
in
the
neighbourhood.
But
this
intelligence
did
not
deter
him
from
the
plan
of
escape
he
had
formed,
and
the
three
pressed
eastward
all
day,
and
heard
no
more
of
the
bread
distribution
than
this
promise.
Nor,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
did
anyone
else
hear
more
of
it.
That
night
fell
the
seventh
star,
falling
upon
Primrose
Hill.
It
fell
while
Miss
Elphinstone
was
watching,
for
she
took
that
duty
alternately
with
my
brother.
She
saw
it.
On
Wednesday
the
three
fugitives--they
had
passed
the
night
in
a
field
of
unripe
wheat--reached
Chelmsford,
and
there
a
body
of
the
inhabitants,
calling
itself
the
Committee
of
Public
Supply,
seized
the
pony
as
provisions,
and
would
give
nothing
in
exchange
for
it
but
the
promise
of
a
share
in
it
the
next
day.
Here
there
were
rumours
of
Martians
at
Epping,
and
news
of
the
destruction
of
Waltham
Abbey
Powder
Mills
in
a
vain
attempt
to
blow
up
one
of
the
invaders.
People
were
watching
for
Martians
here
from
the
church
towers.
My
brother,
very
luckily
for
him
as
it
chanced,
preferred
to
push
on
at
once
to
the
coast
rather
than
wait
for
food,
although
all
three
of
them
were
very
hungry.
By
midday
they
passed
through
Tillingham,
which,
strangely
enough,
seemed
to
be
quite
silent
and
deserted,
save
for
a
few
furtive
plunderers
hunting
for
food.
Near
Tillingham
they
suddenly
came
in
sight
of
the
sea,
and
the
most
amazing
crowd
of
shipping
of
all
sorts
that
it
is
possible
to
imagine.
For
after
the
sailors
could
no
longer
come
up
the
Thames,
they
came
on
to
the
Essex
coast,
to
Harwich
and
Walton
and
Clacton,
and
afterwards
to
Foulness
and
Shoebury,
to
bring
off
the
people.
They
lay
in
a
huge
sickle-shaped
curve
that
vanished
into
mist
at
last
towards
the
Naze.
Close
inshore
was
a
multitude
of
fishing
smacks--English,
Scotch,
French,
Dutch,
and
Swedish;
steam
launches
from
the
Thames,
yachts,
electric
boats;
and
beyond
were
ships
of
large
burden,
a
multitude
of
filthy
colliers,
trim
merchantmen,
cattle
ships,
passenger
boats,
petroleum
tanks,
ocean
tramps,
an
old
white
transport
even,
neat
white
and
grey
liners
from
Southampton
and
Hamburg;
and
along
the
blue
coast
across
the
Blackwater
my
brother
could
make
out
dimly
a
dense
swarm
of
boats
chaffering
with
the
people
on
the
beach,
a
swarm
which
also
extended
up
the
Blackwater
almost
to
Maldon.
About
a
couple
of
miles
out
lay
an
ironclad,
very
low
in
the
water,
almost,
to
my
brother's
perception,
like
a
water-logged
ship.
This
was
the
ram
_Thunder
Child_.
It
was
the
only
warship
in
sight,
but
far
away
to
the
right
over
the
smooth
surface
of
the
sea--for
that
day
there
was
a
dead
calm--lay
a
serpent
of
black
smoke
to
mark
the
next
ironclads
of
the
Channel
Fleet,
which
hovered
in
an
extended
line,
steam
up
and
ready
for
action,
across
the
Thames
estuary
during
the
course
of
the
Martian
conquest,
vigilant
and
yet
powerless
to
prevent
it.
At
the
sight
of
the
sea,
Mrs.
Elphinstone,
in
spite
of
the
assurances
of
her
sister-in-law,
gave
way
to
panic.
She
had
never
been
out
of
England
before,
she
would
rather
die
than
trust
herself
friendless
in
a
foreign
country,
and
so
forth.
She
seemed,
poor
woman,
to
imagine
that
the
French
and
the
Martians
might
prove
very
similar.
She
had
been
growing
increasingly
hysterical,
fearful,
and
depressed
during
the
two
days'
journeyings.
Her
great
idea
was
to
return
to
Stanmore.
Things
had
been
always
well
and
safe
at
Stanmore.
They
would
find
George
at
Stanmore.
It
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
they
could
get
her
down
to
the
beach,
where
presently
my
brother
succeeded
in
attracting
the
attention
of
some
men
on
a
paddle
steamer
from
the
Thames.
They
sent
a
boat
and
drove
a
bargain
for
thirty-six
pounds
for
the
three.
The
steamer
was
going,
these
men
said,
to
Ostend.
It
was
about
two
o'clock
when
my
brother,
having
paid
their
fares
at
the
gangway,
found
himself
safely
aboard
the
steamboat
with
his
charges.
There
was
food
aboard,
albeit
at
exorbitant
prices,
and
the
three
of
them
contrived
to
eat
a
meal
on
one
of
the
seats
forward.
There
were
already
a
couple
of
score
of
passengers
aboard,
some
of
whom
had
expended
their
last
money
in
securing
a
passage,
but
the
captain
lay
off
the
Blackwater
until
five
in
the
afternoon,
picking
up
passengers
until
the
seated
decks
were
even
dangerously
crowded.
He
would
probably
have
remained
longer
had
it
not
been
for
the
sound
of
guns
that
began
about
that
hour
in
the
south.
As
if
in
answer,
the
ironclad
seaward
fired
a
small
gun
and
hoisted
a
string
of
flags.
A
jet
of
smoke
sprang
out
of
her
funnels.
Some
of
the
passengers
were
of
opinion
that
this
firing
came
from
Shoeburyness,
until
it
was
noticed
that
it
was
growing
louder.
At
the
same
time,
far
away
in
the
southeast
the
masts
and
upperworks
of
three
ironclads
rose
one
after
the
other
out
of
the
sea,
beneath
clouds
of
black
smoke.
But
my
brother's
attention
speedily
reverted
to
the
distant
firing
in
the
south.
He
fancied
he
saw
a
column
of
smoke
rising
out
of
the
distant
grey
haze.
The
little
steamer
was
already
flapping
her
way
eastward
of
the
big
crescent
of
shipping,
and
the
low
Essex
coast
was
growing
blue
and
hazy,
when
a
Martian
appeared,
small
and
faint
in
the
remote
distance,
advancing
along
the
muddy
coast
from
the
direction
of
Foulness.
At
that
the
captain
on
the
bridge
swore
at
the
top
of
his
voice
with
fear
and
anger
at
his
own
delay,
and
the
paddles
seemed
infected
with
his
terror.
Every
soul
aboard
stood
at
the
bulwarks
or
on
the
seats
of
the
steamer
and
stared
at
that
distant
shape,
higher
than
the
trees
or
church
towers
inland,
and
advancing
with
a
leisurely
parody
of
a
human
stride.
It
was
the
first
Martian
my
brother
had
seen,
and
he
stood,
more
amazed
than
terrified,
watching
this
Titan
advancing
deliberately
towards
the
shipping,
wading
farther
and
farther
into
the
water
as
the
coast
fell
away.
Then,
far
away
beyond
the
Crouch,
came
another,
striding
over
some
stunted
trees,
and
then
yet
another,
still
farther
off,
wading
deeply
through
a
shiny
mudflat
that
seemed
to
hang
halfway
up
between
sea
and
sky.
They
were
all
stalking
seaward,
as
if
to
intercept
the
escape
of
the
multitudinous
vessels
that
were
crowded
between
Foulness
and
the
Naze.
In
spite
of
the
throbbing
exertions
of
the
engines
of
the
little
paddle-boat,
and
the
pouring
foam
that
her
wheels
flung
behind
her,
she
receded
with
terrifying
slowness
from
this
ominous
advance.
Glancing
northwestward,
my
brother
saw
the
large
crescent
of
shipping
already
writhing
with
the
approaching
terror;
one
ship
passing
behind
another,
another
coming
round
from
broadside
to
end
on,
steamships
whistling
and
giving
off
volumes
of
steam,
sails
being
let
out,
launches
rushing
hither
and
thither.
He
was
so
fascinated
by
this
and
by
the
creeping
danger
away
to
the
left
that
he
had
no
eyes
for
anything
seaward.
And
then
a
swift
movement
of
the
steamboat
(she
had
suddenly
come
round
to
avoid
being
run
down)
flung
him
headlong
from
the
seat
upon
which
he
was
standing.
There
was
a
shouting
all
about
him,
a
trampling
of
feet,
and
a
cheer
that
seemed
to
be
answered
faintly.
The
steamboat
lurched
and
rolled
him
over
upon
his
hands.
He
sprang
to
his
feet
and
saw
to
starboard,
and
not
a
hundred
yards
from
their
heeling,
pitching
boat,
a
vast
iron
bulk
like
the
blade
of
a
plough
tearing
through
the
water,
tossing
it
on
either
side
in
huge
waves
of
foam
that
leaped
towards
the
steamer,
flinging
her
paddles
helplessly
in
the
air,
and
then
sucking
her
deck
down
almost
to
the
waterline.
A
douche
of
spray
blinded
my
brother
for
a
moment.
When
his
eyes
were
clear
again
he
saw
the
monster
had
passed
and
was
rushing
landward.
Big
iron
upperworks
rose
out
of
this
headlong
structure,
and
from
that
twin
funnels
projected
and
spat
a
smoking
blast
shot
with
fire.
It
was
the
torpedo
ram,
_Thunder
Child_,
steaming
headlong,
coming
to
the
rescue
of
the
threatened
shipping.
Keeping
his
footing
on
the
heaving
deck
by
clutching
the
bulwarks,
my
brother
looked
past
this
charging
leviathan
at
the
Martians
again,
and
he
saw
the
three
of
them
now
close
together,
and
standing
so
far
out
to
sea
that
their
tripod
supports
were
almost
entirely
submerged.
Thus
sunken,
and
seen
in
remote
perspective,
they
appeared
far
less
formidable
than
the
huge
iron
bulk
in
whose
wake
the
steamer
was
pitching
so
helplessly.
It
would
seem
they
were
regarding
this
new
antagonist
with
astonishment.
To
their
intelligence,
it
may
be,
the
giant
was
even
such
another
as
themselves.
The
_Thunder
Child_
fired
no
gun,
but
simply
drove
full
speed
towards
them.
It
was
probably
her
not
firing
that
enabled
her
to
get
so
near
the
enemy
as
she
did.
They
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
her.
One
shell,
and
they
would
have
sent
her
to
the
bottom
forthwith
with
the
Heat-Ray.
She
was
steaming
at
such
a
pace
that
in
a
minute
she
seemed
halfway
between
the
steamboat
and
the
Martians--a
diminishing
black
bulk
against
the
receding
horizontal
expanse
of
the
Essex
coast.
Suddenly
the
foremost
Martian
lowered
his
tube
and
discharged
a
canister
of
the
black
gas
at
the
ironclad.
It
hit
her
larboard
side
and
glanced
off
in
an
inky
jet
that
rolled
away
to
seaward,
an
unfolding
torrent
of
Black
Smoke,
from
which
the
ironclad
drove
clear.
To
the
watchers
from
the
steamer,
low
in
the
water
and
with
the
sun
in
their
eyes,
it
seemed
as
though
she
were
already
among
the
Martians.
They
saw
the
gaunt
figures
separating
and
rising
out
of
the
water
as
they
retreated
shoreward,
and
one
of
them
raised
the
camera-like
generator
of
the
Heat-Ray.
He
held
it
pointing
obliquely
downward,
and
a
bank
of
steam
sprang
from
the
water
at
its
touch.
It
must
have
driven
through
the
iron
of
the
ship's
side
like
a
white-hot
iron
rod
through
paper.
A
flicker
of
flame
went
up
through
the
rising
steam,
and
then
the
Martian
reeled
and
staggered.
In
another
moment
he
was
cut
down,
and
a
great
body
of
water
and
steam
shot
high
in
the
air.
The
guns
of
the
_Thunder
Child_
sounded
through
the
reek,
going
off
one
after
the
other,
and
one
shot
splashed
the
water
high
close
by
the
steamer,
ricocheted
towards
the
other
flying
ships
to
the
north,
and
smashed
a
smack
to
matchwood.
But
no
one
heeded
that
very
much.
At
the
sight
of
the
Martian's
collapse
the
captain
on
the
bridge
yelled
inarticulately,
and
all
the
crowding
passengers
on
the
steamer's
stern
shouted
together.
And
then
they
yelled
again.
For,
surging
out
beyond
the
white
tumult,
drove
something
long
and
black,
the
flames
streaming
from
its
middle
parts,
its
ventilators
and
funnels
spouting
fire.
She
was
alive
still;
the
steering
gear,
it
seems,
was
intact
and
her
engines
working.
She
headed
straight
for
a
second
Martian,
and
was
within
a
hundred
yards
of
him
when
the
Heat-Ray
came
to
bear.
Then
with
a
violent
thud,
a
blinding
flash,
her
decks,
her
funnels,
leaped
upward.
The
Martian
staggered
with
the
violence
of
her
explosion,
and
in
another
moment
the
flaming
wreckage,
still
driving
forward
with
the
impetus
of
its
pace,
had
struck
him
and
crumpled
him
up
like
a
thing
of
cardboard.
My
brother
shouted
involuntarily.
A
boiling
tumult
of
steam
hid
everything
again.
"Two!"
yelled
the
captain.
Everyone
was
shouting.
The
whole
steamer
from
end
to
end
rang
with
frantic
cheering
that
was
taken
up
first
by
one
and
then
by
all
in
the
crowding
multitude
of
ships
and
boats
that
was
driving
out
to
sea.
The
steam
hung
upon
the
water
for
many
minutes,
hiding
the
third
Martian
and
the
coast
altogether.
And
all
this
time
the
boat
was
paddling
steadily
out
to
sea
and
away
from
the
fight;
and
when
at
last
the
confusion
cleared,
the
drifting
bank
of
black
vapour
intervened,
and
nothing
of
the
_Thunder
Child_
could
be
made
out,
nor
could
the
third
Martian
be
seen.
But
the
ironclads
to
seaward
were
now
quite
close
and
standing
in
towards
shore
past
the
steamboat.
The
little
vessel
continued
to
beat
its
way
seaward,
and
the
ironclads
receded
slowly
towards
the
coast,
which
was
hidden
still
by
a
marbled
bank
of
vapour,
part
steam,
part
black
gas,
eddying
and
combining
in
the
strangest
way.
The
fleet
of
refugees
was
scattering
to
the
northeast;
several
smacks
were
sailing
between
the
ironclads
and
the
steamboat.
After
a
time,
and
before
they
reached
the
sinking
cloud
bank,
the
warships
turned
northward,
and
then
abruptly
went
about
and
passed
into
the
thickening
haze
of
evening
southward.
The
coast
grew
faint,
and
at
last
indistinguishable
amid
the
low
banks
of
clouds
that
were
gathering
about
the
sinking
sun.
Then
suddenly
out
of
the
golden
haze
of
the
sunset
came
the
vibration
of
guns,
and
a
form
of
black
shadows
moving.
Everyone
struggled
to
the
rail
of
the
steamer
and
peered
into
the
blinding
furnace
of
the
west,
but
nothing
was
to
be
distinguished
clearly.
A
mass
of
smoke
rose
slanting
and
barred
the
face
of
the
sun.
The
steamboat
throbbed
on
its
way
through
an
interminable
suspense.
The
sun
sank
into
grey
clouds,
the
sky
flushed
and
darkened,
the
evening
star
trembled
into
sight.
It
was
deep
twilight
when
the
captain
cried
out
and
pointed.
My
brother
strained
his
eyes.
Something
rushed
up
into
the
sky
out
of
the
greyness--rushed
slantingly
upward
and
very
swiftly
into
the
luminous
clearness
above
the
clouds
in
the
western
sky;
something
flat
and
broad,
and
very
large,
that
swept
round
in
a
vast
curve,
grew
smaller,
sank
slowly,
and
vanished
again
into
the
grey
mystery
of
the
night.
And
as
it
flew
it
rained
down
darkness
upon
the
land.
BOOK
TWO
THE
EARTH
UNDER
THE
MARTIANS
CHAPTER
ONE
UNDER
FOOT
In
the
first
book
I
have
wandered
so
much
from
my
own
adventures
to
tell
of
the
experiences
of
my
brother
that
all
through
the
last
two
chapters
I
and
the
curate
have
been
lurking
in
the
empty
house
at
Halliford
whither
we
fled
to
escape
the
Black
Smoke.
There
I
will
resume.
We
stopped
there
all
Sunday
night
and
all
the
next
day--the
day
of
the
panic--in
a
little
island
of
daylight,
cut
off
by
the
Black
Smoke
from
the
rest
of
the
world.
We
could
do
nothing
but
wait
in
aching
inactivity
during
those
two
weary
days.
My
mind
was
occupied
by
anxiety
for
my
wife.
I
figured
her
at
Leatherhead,
terrified,
in
danger,
mourning
me
already
as
a
dead
man.
I
paced
the
rooms
and
cried
aloud
when
I
thought
of
how
I
was
cut
off
from
her,
of
all
that
might
happen
to
her
in
my
absence.
My
cousin
I
knew
was
brave
enough
for
any
emergency,
but
he
was
not
the
sort
of
man
to
realise
danger
quickly,
to
rise
promptly.
What
was
needed
now
was
not
bravery,
but
circumspection.
My
only
consolation
was
to
believe
that
the
Martians
were
moving
London-ward
and
away
from
her.
Such
vague
anxieties
keep
the
mind
sensitive
and
painful.
I
grew
very
weary
and
irritable
with
the
curate's
perpetual
ejaculations;
I
tired
of
the
sight
of
his
selfish
despair.
After
some
ineffectual
remonstrance
I
kept
away
from
him,
staying
in
a
room--evidently
a
children's
schoolroom--containing
globes,
forms,
and
copybooks.
When
he
followed
me
thither,
I
went
to
a
box
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
and,
in
order
to
be
alone
with
my
aching
miseries,
locked
myself
in.
We
were
hopelessly
hemmed
in
by
the
Black
Smoke
all
that
day
and
the
morning
of
the
next.
There
were
signs
of
people
in
the
next
house
on
Sunday
evening--a
face
at
a
window
and
moving
lights,
and
later
the
slamming
of
a
door.
But
I
do
not
know
who
these
people
were,
nor
what
became
of
them.
We
saw
nothing
of
them
next
day.
The
Black
Smoke
drifted
slowly
riverward
all
through
Monday
morning,
creeping
nearer
and
nearer
to
us,
driving
at
last
along
the
roadway
outside
the
house
that
hid
us.
A
Martian
came
across
the
fields
about
midday,
laying
the
stuff
with
a
jet
of
superheated
steam
that
hissed
against
the
walls,
smashed
all
the
windows
it
touched,
and
scalded
the
curate's
hand
as
he
fled
out
of
the
front
room.
When
at
last
we
crept
across
the
sodden
rooms
and
looked
out
again,
the
country
northward
was
as
though
a
black
snowstorm
had
passed
over
it.
Looking
towards
the
river,
we
were
astonished
to
see
an
unaccountable
redness
mingling
with
the
black
of
the
scorched
meadows.
For
a
time
we
did
not
see
how
this
change
affected
our
position,
save
that
we
were
relieved
of
our
fear
of
the
Black
Smoke.
But
later
I
perceived
that
we
were
no
longer
hemmed
in,
that
now
we
might
get
away.
So
soon
as
I
realised
that
the
way
of
escape
was
open,
my
dream
of
action
returned.
But
the
curate
was
lethargic,
unreasonable.
"We
are
safe
here,"
he
repeated;
"safe
here."
I
resolved
to
leave
him--would
that
I
had!
Wiser
now
for
the
artilleryman's
teaching,
I
sought
out
food
and
drink.
I
had
found
oil
and
rags
for
my
burns,
and
I
also
took
a
hat
and
a
flannel
shirt
that
I
found
in
one
of
the
bedrooms.
When
it
was
clear
to
him
that
I
meant
to
go
alone--had
reconciled
myself
to
going
alone--he
suddenly
roused
himself
to
come.
And
all
being
quiet
throughout
the
afternoon,
we
started
about
five
o'clock,
as
I
should
judge,
along
the
blackened
road
to
Sunbury.
In
Sunbury,
and
at
intervals
along
the
road,
were
dead
bodies
lying
in
contorted
attitudes,
horses
as
well
as
men,
overturned
carts
and
luggage,
all
covered
thickly
with
black
dust.
That
pall
of
cindery
powder
made
me
think
of
what
I
had
read
of
the
destruction
of
Pompeii.
We
got
to
Hampton
Court
without
misadventure,
our
minds
full
of
strange
and
unfamiliar
appearances,
and
at
Hampton
Court
our
eyes
were
relieved
to
find
a
patch
of
green
that
had
escaped
the
suffocating
drift.
We
went
through
Bushey
Park,
with
its
deer
going
to
and
fro
under
the
chestnuts,
and
some
men
and
women
hurrying
in
the
distance
towards
Hampton,
and
so
we
came
to
Twickenham.
These
were
the
first
people
we
saw.
Away
across
the
road
the
woods
beyond
Ham
and
Petersham
were
still
afire.
Twickenham
was
uninjured
by
either
Heat-Ray
or
Black
Smoke,
and
there
were
more
people
about
here,
though
none
could
give
us
news.
For
the
most
part
they
were
like
ourselves,
taking
advantage
of
a
lull
to
shift
their
quarters.
I
have
an
impression
that
many
of
the
houses
here
were
still
occupied
by
scared
inhabitants,
too
frightened
even
for
flight.
Here
too
the
evidence
of
a
hasty
rout
was
abundant
along
the
road.
I
remember
most
vividly
three
smashed
bicycles
in
a
heap,
pounded
into
the
road
by
the
wheels
of
subsequent
carts.
We
crossed
Richmond
Bridge
about
half
past
eight.
We
hurried
across
the
exposed
bridge,
of
course,
but
I
noticed
floating
down
the
stream
a
number
of
red
masses,
some
many
feet
across.
I
did
not
know
what
these
were--there
was
no
time
for
scrutiny--and
I
put
a
more
horrible
interpretation
on
them
than
they
deserved.
Here
again
on
the
Surrey
side
were
black
dust
that
had
once
been
smoke,
and
dead
bodies--a
heap
near
the
approach
to
the
station;
but
we
had
no
glimpse
of
the
Martians
until
we
were
some
way
towards
Barnes.
We
saw
in
the
blackened
distance
a
group
of
three
people
running
down
a
side
street
towards
the
river,
but
otherwise
it
seemed
deserted.
Up
the
hill
Richmond
town
was
burning
briskly;
outside
the
town
of
Richmond
there
was
no
trace
of
the
Black
Smoke.
Then
suddenly,
as
we
approached
Kew,
came
a
number
of
people
running,
and
the
upperworks
of
a
Martian
fighting-machine
loomed
in
sight
over
the
housetops,
not
a
hundred
yards
away
from
us.
We
stood
aghast
at
our
danger,
and
had
the
Martian
looked
down
we
must
immediately
have
perished.
We
were
so
terrified
that
we
dared
not
go
on,
but
turned
aside
and
hid
in
a
shed
in
a
garden.
There
the
curate
crouched,
weeping
silently,
and
refusing
to
stir
again.
But
my
fixed
idea
of
reaching
Leatherhead
would
not
let
me
rest,
and
in
the
twilight
I
ventured
out
again.
I
went
through
a
shrubbery,
and
along
a
passage
beside
a
big
house
standing
in
its
own
grounds,
and
so
emerged
upon
the
road
towards
Kew.
The
curate
I
left
in
the
shed,
but
he
came
hurrying
after
me.
That
second
start
was
the
most
foolhardy
thing
I
ever
did.
For
it
was
manifest
the
Martians
were
about
us.
No
sooner
had
the
curate
overtaken
me
than
we
saw
either
the
fighting-machine
we
had
seen
before
or
another,
far
away
across
the
meadows
in
the
direction
of
Kew
Lodge.
Four
or
five
little
black
figures
hurried
before
it
across
the
green-grey
of
the
field,
and
in
a
moment
it
was
evident
this
Martian
pursued
them.
In
three
strides
he
was
among
them,
and
they
ran
radiating
from
his
feet
in
all
directions.
He
used
no
Heat-Ray
to
destroy
them,
but
picked
them
up
one
by
one.
Apparently
he
tossed
them
into
the
great
metallic
carrier
which
projected
behind
him,
much
as
a
workman's
basket
hangs
over
his
shoulder.
It
was
the
first
time
I
realised
that
the
Martians
might
have
any
other
purpose
than
destruction
with
defeated
humanity.
We
stood
for
a
moment
petrified,
then
turned
and
fled
through
a
gate
behind
us
into
a
walled
garden,
fell
into,
rather
than
found,
a
fortunate
ditch,
and
lay
there,
scarce
daring
to
whisper
to
each
other
until
the
stars
were
out.
I
suppose
it
was
nearly
eleven
o'clock
before
we
gathered
courage
to
start
again,
no
longer
venturing
into
the
road,
but
sneaking
along
hedgerows
and
through
plantations,
and
watching
keenly
through
the
darkness,
he
on
the
right
and
I
on
the
left,
for
the
Martians,
who
seemed
to
be
all
about
us.
In
one
place
we
blundered
upon
a
scorched
and
blackened
area,
now
cooling
and
ashen,
and
a
number
of
scattered
dead
bodies
of
men,
burned
horribly
about
the
heads
and
trunks
but
with
their
legs
and
boots
mostly
intact;
and
of
dead
horses,
fifty
feet,
perhaps,
behind
a
line
of
four
ripped
guns
and
smashed
gun
carriages.
Sheen,
it
seemed,
had
escaped
destruction,
but
the
place
was
silent
and
deserted.
Here
we
happened
on
no
dead,
though
the
night
was
too
dark
for
us
to
see
into
the
side
roads
of
the
place.
In
Sheen
my
companion
suddenly
complained
of
faintness
and
thirst,
and
we
decided
to
try
one
of
the
houses.
The
first
house
we
entered,
after
a
little
difficulty
with
the
window,
was
a
small
semi-detached
villa,
and
I
found
nothing
eatable
left
in
the
place
but
some
mouldy
cheese.
There
was,
however,
water
to
drink;
and
I
took
a
hatchet,
which
promised
to
be
useful
in
our
next
house-breaking.
We
then
crossed
to
a
place
where
the
road
turns
towards
Mortlake.
Here
there
stood
a
white
house
within
a
walled
garden,
and
in
the
pantry
of
this
domicile
we
found
a
store
of
food--two
loaves
of
bread
in
a
pan,
an
uncooked
steak,
and
the
half
of
a
ham.
I
give
this
catalogue
so
precisely
because,
as
it
happened,
we
were
destined
to
subsist
upon
this
store
for
the
next
fortnight.
Bottled
beer
stood
under
a
shelf,
and
there
were
two
bags
of
haricot
beans
and
some
limp
lettuces.
This
pantry
opened
into
a
kind
of
wash-up
kitchen,
and
in
this
was
firewood;
there
was
also
a
cupboard,
in
which
we
found
nearly
a
dozen
of
burgundy,
tinned
soups
and
salmon,
and
two
tins
of
biscuits.
We
sat
in
the
adjacent
kitchen
in
the
dark--for
we
dared
not
strike
a
light--and
ate
bread
and
ham,
and
drank
beer
out
of
the
same
bottle.
The
curate,
who
was
still
timorous
and
restless,
was
now,
oddly
enough,
for
pushing
on,
and
I
was
urging
him
to
keep
up
his
strength
by
eating
when
the
thing
happened
that
was
to
imprison
us.
"It
can't
be
midnight
yet,"
I
said,
and
then
came
a
blinding
glare
of
vivid
green
light.
Everything
in
the
kitchen
leaped
out,
clearly
visible
in
green
and
black,
and
vanished
again.
And
then
followed
such
a
concussion
as
I
have
never
heard
before
or
since.
So
close
on
the
heels
of
this
as
to
seem
instantaneous
came
a
thud
behind
me,
a
clash
of
glass,
a
crash
and
rattle
of
falling
masonry
all
about
us,
and
the
plaster
of
the
ceiling
came
down
upon
us,
smashing
into
a
multitude
of
fragments
upon
our
heads.
I
was
knocked
headlong
across
the
floor
against
the
oven
handle
and
stunned.
I
was
insensible
for
a
long
time,
the
curate
told
me,
and
when
I
came
to
we
were
in
darkness
again,
and
he,
with
a
face
wet,
as
I
found
afterwards,
with
blood
from
a
cut
forehead,
was
dabbing
water
over
me.
For
some
time
I
could
not
recollect
what
had
happened.
Then
things
came
to
me
slowly.
A
bruise
on
my
temple
asserted
itself.
"Are
you
better?"
asked
the
curate
in
a
whisper.
At
last
I
answered
him.
I
sat
up.
"Don't
move,"
he
said.
"The
floor
is
covered
with
smashed
crockery
from
the
dresser.
You
can't
possibly
move
without
making
a
noise,
and
I
fancy
_they_
are
outside."
We
both
sat
quite
silent,
so
that
we
could
scarcely
hear
each
other
breathing.
Everything
seemed
deadly
still,
but
once
something
near
us,
some
plaster
or
broken
brickwork,
slid
down
with
a
rumbling
sound.
Outside
and
very
near
was
an
intermittent,
metallic
rattle.
"That!"
said
the
curate,
when
presently
it
happened
again.
"Yes,"
I
said.
"But
what
is
it?"
"A
Martian!"
said
the
curate.
I
listened
again.
"It
was
not
like
the
Heat-Ray,"
I
said,
and
for
a
time
I
was
inclined
to
think
one
of
the
great
fighting-machines
had
stumbled
against
the
house,
as
I
had
seen
one
stumble
against
the
tower
of
Shepperton
Church.
Our
situation
was
so
strange
and
incomprehensible
that
for
three
or
four
hours,
until
the
dawn
came,
we
scarcely
moved.
And
then
the
light
filtered
in,
not
through
the
window,
which
remained
black,
but
through
a
triangular
aperture
between
a
beam
and
a
heap
of
broken
bricks
in
the
wall
behind
us.
The
interior
of
the
kitchen
we
now
saw
greyly
for
the
first
time.
The
window
had
been
burst
in
by
a
mass
of
garden
mould,
which
flowed
over
the
table
upon
which
we
had
been
sitting
and
lay
about
our
feet.
Outside,
the
soil
was
banked
high
against
the
house.
At
the
top
of
the
window
frame
we
could
see
an
uprooted
drainpipe.
The
floor
was
littered
with
smashed
hardware;
the
end
of
the
kitchen
towards
the
house
was
broken
into,
and
since
the
daylight
shone
in
there,
it
was
evident
the
greater
part
of
the
house
had
collapsed.
Contrasting
vividly
with
this
ruin
was
the
neat
dresser,
stained
in
the
fashion,
pale
green,
and
with
a
number
of
copper
and
tin
vessels
below
it,
the
wallpaper
imitating
blue
and
white
tiles,
and
a
couple
of
coloured
supplements
fluttering
from
the
walls
above
the
kitchen
range.
As
the
dawn
grew
clearer,
we
saw
through
the
gap
in
the
wall
the
body
of
a
Martian,
standing
sentinel,
I
suppose,
over
the
still
glowing
cylinder.
At
the
sight
of
that
we
crawled
as
circumspectly
as
possible
out
of
the
twilight
of
the
kitchen
into
the
darkness
of
the
scullery.
Abruptly
the
right
interpretation
dawned
upon
my
mind.
"The
fifth
cylinder,"
I
whispered,
"the
fifth
shot
from
Mars,
has
struck
this
house
and
buried
us
under
the
ruins!"
For
a
time
the
curate
was
silent,
and
then
he
whispered:
"God
have
mercy
upon
us!"
I
heard
him
presently
whimpering
to
himself.
Save
for
that
sound
we
lay
quite
still
in
the
scullery;
I
for
my
part
scarce
dared
breathe,
and
sat
with
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
faint
light
of
the
kitchen
door.
I
could
just
see
the
curate's
face,
a
dim,
oval
shape,
and
his
collar
and
cuffs.
Outside
there
began
a
metallic
hammering,
then
a
violent
hooting,
and
then
again,
after
a
quiet
interval,
a
hissing
like
the
hissing
of
an
engine.
These
noises,
for
the
most
part
problematical,
continued
intermittently,
and
seemed
if
anything
to
increase
in
number
as
time
wore
on.
Presently
a
measured
thudding
and
a
vibration
that
made
everything
about
us
quiver
and
the
vessels
in
the
pantry
ring
and
shift,
began
and
continued.
Once
the
light
was
eclipsed,
and
the
ghostly
kitchen
doorway
became
absolutely
dark.
For
many
hours
we
must
have
crouched
there,
silent
and
shivering,
until
our
tired
attention
failed.
.
.
.
At
last
I
found
myself
awake
and
very
hungry.
I
am
inclined
to
believe
we
must
have
spent
the
greater
portion
of
a
day
before
that
awakening.
My
hunger
was
at
a
stride
so
insistent
that
it
moved
me
to
action.
I
told
the
curate
I
was
going
to
seek
food,
and
felt
my
way
towards
the
pantry.
He
made
me
no
answer,
but
so
soon
as
I
began
eating
the
faint
noise
I
made
stirred
him
up
and
I
heard
him
crawling
after
me.
CHAPTER
TWO
WHAT
WE
SAW
FROM
THE
RUINED
HOUSE
After
eating
we
crept
back
to
the
scullery,
and
there
I
must
have
dozed
again,
for
when
presently
I
looked
round
I
was
alone.
The
thudding
vibration
continued
with
wearisome
persistence.
I
whispered
for
the
curate
several
times,
and
at
last
felt
my
way
to
the
door
of
the
kitchen.
It
was
still
daylight,
and
I
perceived
him
across
the
room,
lying
against
the
triangular
hole
that
looked
out
upon
the
Martians.
His
shoulders
were
hunched,
so
that
his
head
was
hidden
from
me.
I
could
hear
a
number
of
noises
almost
like
those
in
an
engine
shed;
and
the
place
rocked
with
that
beating
thud.
Through
the
aperture
in
the
wall
I
could
see
the
top
of
a
tree
touched
with
gold
and
the
warm
blue
of
a
tranquil
evening
sky.
For
a
minute
or
so
I
remained
watching
the
curate,
and
then
I
advanced,
crouching
and
stepping
with
extreme
care
amid
the
broken
crockery
that
littered
the
floor.
I
touched
the
curate's
leg,
and
he
started
so
violently
that
a
mass
of
plaster
went
sliding
down
outside
and
fell
with
a
loud
impact.
I
gripped
his
arm,
fearing
he
might
cry
out,
and
for
a
long
time
we
crouched
motionless.
Then
I
turned
to
see
how
much
of
our
rampart
remained.
The
detachment
of
the
plaster
had
left
a
vertical
slit
open
in
the
debris,
and
by
raising
myself
cautiously
across
a
beam
I
was
able
to
see
out
of
this
gap
into
what
had
been
overnight
a
quiet
suburban
roadway.
Vast,
indeed,
was
the
change
that
we
beheld.
The
fifth
cylinder
must
have
fallen
right
into
the
midst
of
the
house
we
had
first
visited.
The
building
had
vanished,
completely
smashed,
pulverised,
and
dispersed
by
the
blow.
The
cylinder
lay
now
far
beneath
the
original
foundations--deep
in
a
hole,
already
vastly
larger
than
the
pit
I
had
looked
into
at
Woking.
The
earth
all
round
it
had
splashed
under
that
tremendous
impact--"splashed"
is
the
only
word--and
lay
in
heaped
piles
that
hid
the
masses
of
the
adjacent
houses.
It
had
behaved
exactly
like
mud
under
the
violent
blow
of
a
hammer.
Our
house
had
collapsed
backward;
the
front
portion,
even
on
the
ground
floor,
had
been
destroyed
completely;
by
a
chance
the
kitchen
and
scullery
had
escaped,
and
stood
buried
now
under
soil
and
ruins,
closed
in
by
tons
of
earth
on
every
side
save
towards
the
cylinder.
Over
that
aspect
we
hung
now
on
the
very
edge
of
the
great
circular
pit
the
Martians
were
engaged
in
making.
The
heavy
beating
sound
was
evidently
just
behind
us,
and
ever
and
again
a
bright
green
vapour
drove
up
like
a
veil
across
our
peephole.
The
cylinder
was
already
opened
in
the
centre
of
the
pit,
and
on
the
farther
edge
of
the
pit,
amid
the
smashed
and
gravel-heaped
shrubbery,
one
of
the
great
fighting-machines,
deserted
by
its
occupant,
stood
stiff
and
tall
against
the
evening
sky.
At
first
I
scarcely
noticed
the
pit
and
the
cylinder,
although
it
has
been
convenient
to
describe
them
first,
on
account
of
the
extraordinary
glittering
mechanism
I
saw
busy
in
the
excavation,
and
on
account
of
the
strange
creatures
that
were
crawling
slowly
and
painfully
across
the
heaped
mould
near
it.
The
mechanism
it
certainly
was
that
held
my
attention
first.
It
was
one
of
those
complicated
fabrics
that
have
since
been
called
handling-machines,
and
the
study
of
which
has
already
given
such
an
enormous
impetus
to
terrestrial
invention.
As
it
dawned
upon
me
first,
it
presented
a
sort
of
metallic
spider
with
five
jointed,
agile
legs,
and
with
an
extraordinary
number
of
jointed
levers,
bars,
and
reaching
and
clutching
tentacles
about
its
body.
Most
of
its
arms
were
retracted,
but
with
three
long
tentacles
it
was
fishing
out
a
number
of
rods,
plates,
and
bars
which
lined
the
covering
and
apparently
strengthened
the
walls
of
the
cylinder.
These,
as
it
extracted
them,
were
lifted
out
and
deposited
upon
a
level
surface
of
earth
behind
it.
Its
motion
was
so
swift,
complex,
and
perfect
that
at
first
I
did
not
see
it
as
a
machine,
in
spite
of
its
metallic
glitter.
The
fighting-machines
were
coordinated
and
animated
to
an
extraordinary
pitch,
but
nothing
to
compare
with
this.
People
who
have
never
seen
these
structures,
and
have
only
the
ill-imagined
efforts
of
artists
or
the
imperfect
descriptions
of
such
eye-witnesses
as
myself
to
go
upon,
scarcely
realise
that
living
quality.
I
recall
particularly
the
illustration
of
one
of
the
first
pamphlets
to
give
a
consecutive
account
of
the
war.
The
artist
had
evidently
made
a
hasty
study
of
one
of
the
fighting-machines,
and
there
his
knowledge
ended.
He
presented
them
as
tilted,
stiff
tripods,
without
either
flexibility
or
subtlety,
and
with
an
altogether
misleading
monotony
of
effect.
The
pamphlet
containing
these
renderings
had
a
considerable
vogue,
and
I
mention
them
here
simply
to
warn
the
reader
against
the
impression
they
may
have
created.
They
were
no
more
like
the
Martians
I
saw
in
action
than
a
Dutch
doll
is
like
a
human
being.
To
my
mind,
the
pamphlet
would
have
been
much
better
without
them.
At
first,
I
say,
the
handling-machine
did
not
impress
me
as
a
machine,
but
as
a
crablike
creature
with
a
glittering
integument,
the
controlling
Martian
whose
delicate
tentacles
actuated
its
movements
seeming
to
be
simply
the
equivalent
of
the
crab's
cerebral
portion.
But
then
I
perceived
the
resemblance
of
its
grey-brown,
shiny,
leathery
integument
to
that
of
the
other
sprawling
bodies
beyond,
and
the
true
nature
of
this
dexterous
workman
dawned
upon
me.
With
that
realisation
my
interest
shifted
to
those
other
creatures,
the
real
Martians.
Already
I
had
had
a
transient
impression
of
these,
and
the
first
nausea
no
longer
obscured
my
observation.
Moreover,
I
was
concealed
and
motionless,
and
under
no
urgency
of
action.
They
were,
I
now
saw,
the
most
unearthly
creatures
it
is
possible
to
conceive.
They
were
huge
round
bodies--or,
rather,
heads--about
four
feet
in
diameter,
each
body
having
in
front
of
it
a
face.
This
face
had
no
nostrils--indeed,
the
Martians
do
not
seem
to
have
had
any
sense
of
smell,
but
it
had
a
pair
of
very
large
dark-coloured
eyes,
and
just
beneath
this
a
kind
of
fleshy
beak.
In
the
back
of
this
head
or
body--I
scarcely
know
how
to
speak
of
it--was
the
single
tight
tympanic
surface,
since
known
to
be
anatomically
an
ear,
though
it
must
have
been
almost
useless
in
our
dense
air.
In
a
group
round
the
mouth
were
sixteen
slender,
almost
whiplike
tentacles,
arranged
in
two
bunches
of
eight
each.
These
bunches
have
since
been
named
rather
aptly,
by
that
distinguished
anatomist,
Professor
Howes,
the
_hands_.
Even
as
I
saw
these
Martians
for
the
first
time
they
seemed
to
be
endeavouring
to
raise
themselves
on
these
hands,
but
of
course,
with
the
increased
weight
of
terrestrial
conditions,
this
was
impossible.
There
is
reason
to
suppose
that
on
Mars
they
may
have
progressed
upon
them
with
some
facility.
The
internal
anatomy,
I
may
remark
here,
as
dissection
has
since
shown,
was
almost
equally
simple.
The
greater
part
of
the
structure
was
the
brain,
sending
enormous
nerves
to
the
eyes,
ear,
and
tactile
tentacles.
Besides
this
were
the
bulky
lungs,
into
which
the
mouth
opened,
and
the
heart
and
its
vessels.
The
pulmonary
distress
caused
by
the
denser
atmosphere
and
greater
gravitational
attraction
was
only
too
evident
in
the
convulsive
movements
of
the
outer
skin.
And
this
was
the
sum
of
the
Martian
organs.
Strange
as
it
may
seem
to
a
human
being,
all
the
complex
apparatus
of
digestion,
which
makes
up
the
bulk
of
our
bodies,
did
not
exist
in
the
Martians.
They
were
heads--merely
heads.
Entrails
they
had
none.
They
did
not
eat,
much
less
digest.
Instead,
they
took
the
fresh,
living
blood
of
other
creatures,
and
_injected_
it
into
their
own
veins.
I
have
myself
seen
this
being
done,
as
I
shall
mention
in
its
place.
But,
squeamish
as
I
may
seem,
I
cannot
bring
myself
to
describe
what
I
could
not
endure
even
to
continue
watching.
Let
it
suffice
to
say,
blood
obtained
from
a
still
living
animal,
in
most
cases
from
a
human
being,
was
run
directly
by
means
of
a
little
pipette
into
the
recipient
canal.
.
.
.
The
bare
idea
of
this
is
no
doubt
horribly
repulsive
to
us,
but
at
the
same
time
I
think
that
we
should
remember
how
repulsive
our
carnivorous
habits
would
seem
to
an
intelligent
rabbit.
The
physiological
advantages
of
the
practice
of
injection
are
undeniable,
if
one
thinks
of
the
tremendous
waste
of
human
time
and
energy
occasioned
by
eating
and
the
digestive
process.
Our
bodies
are
half
made
up
of
glands
and
tubes
and
organs,
occupied
in
turning
heterogeneous
food
into
blood.
The
digestive
processes
and
their
reaction
upon
the
nervous
system
sap
our
strength
and
colour
our
minds.
Men
go
happy
or
miserable
as
they
have
healthy
or
unhealthy
livers,
or
sound
gastric
glands.
But
the
Martians
were
lifted
above
all
these
organic
fluctuations
of
mood
and
emotion.
Their
undeniable
preference
for
men
as
their
source
of
nourishment
is
partly
explained
by
the
nature
of
the
remains
of
the
victims
they
had
brought
with
them
as
provisions
from
Mars.
These
creatures,
to
judge
from
the
shrivelled
remains
that
have
fallen
into
human
hands,
were
bipeds
with
flimsy,
silicious
skeletons
(almost
like
those
of
the
silicious
sponges)
and
feeble
musculature,
standing
about
six
feet
high
and
having
round,
erect
heads,
and
large
eyes
in
flinty
sockets.
Two
or
three
of
these
seem
to
have
been
brought
in
each
cylinder,
and
all
were
killed
before
earth
was
reached.
It
was
just
as
well
for
them,
for
the
mere
attempt
to
stand
upright
upon
our
planet
would
have
broken
every
bone
in
their
bodies.
And
while
I
am
engaged
in
this
description,
I
may
add
in
this
place
certain
further
details
which,
although
they
were
not
all
evident
to
us
at
the
time,
will
enable
the
reader
who
is
unacquainted
with
them
to
form
a
clearer
picture
of
these
offensive
creatures.
In
three
other
points
their
physiology
differed
strangely
from
ours.
Their
organisms
did
not
sleep,
any
more
than
the
heart
of
man
sleeps.
Since
they
had
no
extensive
muscular
mechanism
to
recuperate,
that
periodical
extinction
was
unknown
to
them.
They
had
little
or
no
sense
of
fatigue,
it
would
seem.
On
earth
they
could
never
have
moved
without
effort,
yet
even
to
the
last
they
kept
in
action.
In
twenty-four
hours
they
did
twenty-four
hours
of
work,
as
even
on
earth
is
perhaps
the
case
with
the
ants.
In
the
next
place,
wonderful
as
it
seems
in
a
sexual
world,
the
Martians
were
absolutely
without
sex,
and
therefore
without
any
of
the
tumultuous
emotions
that
arise
from
that
difference
among
men.
A
young
Martian,
there
can
now
be
no
dispute,
was
really
born
upon
earth
during
the
war,
and
it
was
found
attached
to
its
parent,
partially
_budded_
off,
just
as
young
lilybulbs
bud
off,
or
like
the
young
animals
in
the
fresh-water
polyp.
In
man,
in
all
the
higher
terrestrial
animals,
such
a
method
of
increase
has
disappeared;
but
even
on
this
earth
it
was
certainly
the
primitive
method.
Among
the
lower
animals,
up
even
to
those
first
cousins
of
the
vertebrated
animals,
the
Tunicates,
the
two
processes
occur
side
by
side,
but
finally
the
sexual
method
superseded
its
competitor
altogether.
On
Mars,
however,
just
the
reverse
has
apparently
been
the
case.
It
is
worthy
of
remark
that
a
certain
speculative
writer
of
quasi-scientific
repute,
writing
long
before
the
Martian
invasion,
did
forecast
for
man
a
final
structure
not
unlike
the
actual
Martian
condition.
His
prophecy,
I
remember,
appeared
in
November
or
December,
1893,
in
a
long-defunct
publication,
the
_Pall
Mall
Budget_,
and
I
recall
a
caricature
of
it
in
a
pre-Martian
periodical
called
_Punch_.
He
pointed
out--writing
in
a
foolish,
facetious
tone--that
the
perfection
of
mechanical
appliances
must
ultimately
supersede
limbs;
the
perfection
of
chemical
devices,
digestion;
that
such
organs
as
hair,
external
nose,
teeth,
ears,
and
chin
were
no
longer
essential
parts
of
the
human
being,
and
that
the
tendency
of
natural
selection
would
lie
in
the
direction
of
their
steady
diminution
through
the
coming
ages.
The
brain
alone
remained
a
cardinal
necessity.
Only
one
other
part
of
the
body
had
a
strong
case
for
survival,
and
that
was
the
hand,
"teacher
and
agent
of
the
brain."
While
the
rest
of
the
body
dwindled,
the
hands
would
grow
larger.
There
is
many
a
true
word
written
in
jest,
and
here
in
the
Martians
we
have
beyond
dispute
the
actual
accomplishment
of
such
a
suppression
of
the
animal
side
of
the
organism
by
the
intelligence.
To
me
it
is
quite
credible
that
the
Martians
may
be
descended
from
beings
not
unlike
ourselves,
by
a
gradual
development
of
brain
and
hands
(the
latter
giving
rise
to
the
two
bunches
of
delicate
tentacles
at
last)
at
the
expense
of
the
rest
of
the
body.
Without
the
body
the
brain
would,
of
course,
become
a
mere
selfish
intelligence,
without
any
of
the
emotional
substratum
of
the
human
being.
The
last
salient
point
in
which
the
systems
of
these
creatures
differed
from
ours
was
in
what
one
might
have
thought
a
very
trivial
particular.
Micro-organisms,
which
cause
so
much
disease
and
pain
on
earth,
have
either
never
appeared
upon
Mars
or
Martian
sanitary
science
eliminated
them
ages
ago.
A
hundred
diseases,
all
the
fevers
and
contagions
of
human
life,
consumption,
cancers,
tumours
and
such
morbidities,
never
enter
the
scheme
of
their
life.
And
speaking
of
the
differences
between
the
life
on
Mars
and
terrestrial
life,
I
may
allude
here
to
the
curious
suggestions
of
the
red
weed.
Apparently
the
vegetable
kingdom
in
Mars,
instead
of
having
green
for
a
dominant
colour,
is
of
a
vivid
blood-red
tint.
At
any
rate,
the
seeds
which
the
Martians
(intentionally
or
accidentally)
brought
with
them
gave
rise
in
all
cases
to
red-coloured
growths.
Only
that
known
popularly
as
the
red
weed,
however,
gained
any
footing
in
competition
with
terrestrial
forms.
The
red
creeper
was
quite
a
transitory
growth,
and
few
people
have
seen
it
growing.
For
a
time,
however,
the
red
weed
grew
with
astonishing
vigour
and
luxuriance.
It
spread
up
the
sides
of
the
pit
by
the
third
or
fourth
day
of
our
imprisonment,
and
its
cactus-like
branches
formed
a
carmine
fringe
to
the
edges
of
our
triangular
window.
And
afterwards
I
found
it
broadcast
throughout
the
country,
and
especially
wherever
there
was
a
stream
of
water.
The
Martians
had
what
appears
to
have
been
an
auditory
organ,
a
single
round
drum
at
the
back
of
the
head-body,
and
eyes
with
a
visual
range
not
very
different
from
ours
except
that,
according
to
Philips,
blue
and
violet
were
as
black
to
them.
It
is
commonly
supposed
that
they
communicated
by
sounds
and
tentacular
gesticulations;
this
is
asserted,
for
instance,
in
the
able
but
hastily
compiled
pamphlet
(written
evidently
by
someone
not
an
eye-witness
of
Martian
actions)
to
which
I
have
already
alluded,
and
which,
so
far,
has
been
the
chief
source
of
information
concerning
them.
Now
no
surviving
human
being
saw
so
much
of
the
Martians
in
action
as
I
did.
I
take
no
credit
to
myself
for
an
accident,
but
the
fact
is
so.
And
I
assert
that
I
watched
them
closely
time
after
time,
and
that
I
have
seen
four,
five,
and
(once)
six
of
them
sluggishly
performing
the
most
elaborately
complicated
operations
together
without
either
sound
or
gesture.
Their
peculiar
hooting
invariably
preceded
feeding;
it
had
no
modulation,
and
was,
I
believe,
in
no
sense
a
signal,
but
merely
the
expiration
of
air
preparatory
to
the
suctional
operation.
I
have
a
certain
claim
to
at
least
an
elementary
knowledge
of
psychology,
and
in
this
matter
I
am
convinced--as
firmly
as
I
am
convinced
of
anything--that
the
Martians
interchanged
thoughts
without
any
physical
intermediation.
And
I
have
been
convinced
of
this
in
spite
of
strong
preconceptions.
Before
the
Martian
invasion,
as
an
occasional
reader
here
or
there
may
remember,
I
had
written
with
some
little
vehemence
against
the
telepathic
theory.
The
Martians
wore
no
clothing.
Their
conceptions
of
ornament
and
decorum
were
necessarily
different
from
ours;
and
not
only
were
they
evidently
much
less
sensible
of
changes
of
temperature
than
we
are,
but
changes
of
pressure
do
not
seem
to
have
affected
their
health
at
all
seriously.
Yet
though
they
wore
no
clothing,
it
was
in
the
other
artificial
additions
to
their
bodily
resources
that
their
great
superiority
over
man
lay.
We
men,
with
our
bicycles
and
road-skates,
our
Lilienthal
soaring-machines,
our
guns
and
sticks
and
so
forth,
are
just
in
the
beginning
of
the
evolution
that
the
Martians
have
worked
out.
They
have
become
practically
mere
brains,
wearing
different
bodies
according
to
their
needs
just
as
men
wear
suits
of
clothes
and
take
a
bicycle
in
a
hurry
or
an
umbrella
in
the
wet.
And
of
their
appliances,
perhaps
nothing
is
more
wonderful
to
a
man
than
the
curious
fact
that
what
is
the
dominant
feature
of
almost
all
human
devices
in
mechanism
is
absent--the
_wheel_
is
absent;
among
all
the
things
they
brought
to
earth
there
is
no
trace
or
suggestion
of
their
use
of
wheels.
One
would
have
at
least
expected
it
in
locomotion.
And
in
this
connection
it
is
curious
to
remark
that
even
on
this
earth
Nature
has
never
hit
upon
the
wheel,
or
has
preferred
other
expedients
to
its
development.
And
not
only
did
the
Martians
either
not
know
of
(which
is
incredible),
or
abstain
from,
the
wheel,
but
in
their
apparatus
singularly
little
use
is
made
of
the
fixed
pivot
or
relatively
fixed
pivot,
with
circular
motions
thereabout
confined
to
one
plane.
Almost
all
the
joints
of
the
machinery
present
a
complicated
system
of
sliding
parts
moving
over
small
but
beautifully
curved
friction
bearings.
And
while
upon
this
matter
of
detail,
it
is
remarkable
that
the
long
leverages
of
their
machines
are
in
most
cases
actuated
by
a
sort
of
sham
musculature
of
the
disks
in
an
elastic
sheath;
these
disks
become
polarised
and
drawn
closely
and
powerfully
together
when
traversed
by
a
current
of
electricity.
In
this
way
the
curious
parallelism
to
animal
motions,
which
was
so
striking
and
disturbing
to
the
human
beholder,
was
attained.
Such
quasi-muscles
abounded
in
the
crablike
handling-machine
which,
on
my
first
peeping
out
of
the
slit,
I
watched
unpacking
the
cylinder.
It
seemed
infinitely
more
alive
than
the
actual
Martians
lying
beyond
it
in
the
sunset
light,
panting,
stirring
ineffectual
tentacles,
and
moving
feebly
after
their
vast
journey
across
space.
While
I
was
still
watching
their
sluggish
motions
in
the
sunlight,
and
noting
each
strange
detail
of
their
form,
the
curate
reminded
me
of
his
presence
by
pulling
violently
at
my
arm.
I
turned
to
a
scowling
face,
and
silent,
eloquent
lips.
He
wanted
the
slit,
which
permitted
only
one
of
us
to
peep
through;
and
so
I
had
to
forego
watching
them
for
a
time
while
he
enjoyed
that
privilege.
When
I
looked
again,
the
busy
handling-machine
had
already
put
together
several
of
the
pieces
of
apparatus
it
had
taken
out
of
the
cylinder
into
a
shape
having
an
unmistakable
likeness
to
its
own;
and
down
on
the
left
a
busy
little
digging
mechanism
had
come
into
view,
emitting
jets
of
green
vapour
and
working
its
way
round
the
pit,
excavating
and
embanking
in
a
methodical
and
discriminating
manner.
This
it
was
which
had
caused
the
regular
beating
noise,
and
the
rhythmic
shocks
that
had
kept
our
ruinous
refuge
quivering.
It
piped
and
whistled
as
it
worked.
So
far
as
I
could
see,
the
thing
was
without
a
directing
Martian
at
all.
CHAPTER
THREE
THE
DAYS
OF
IMPRISONMENT
The
arrival
of
a
second
fighting-machine
drove
us
from
our
peephole
into
the
scullery,
for
we
feared
that
from
his
elevation
the
Martian
might
see
down
upon
us
behind
our
barrier.
At
a
later
date
we
began
to
feel
less
in
danger
of
their
eyes,
for
to
an
eye
in
the
dazzle
of
the
sunlight
outside
our
refuge
must
have
been
blank
blackness,
but
at
first
the
slightest
suggestion
of
approach
drove
us
into
the
scullery
in
heart-throbbing
retreat.
Yet
terrible
as
was
the
danger
we
incurred,
the
attraction
of
peeping
was
for
both
of
us
irresistible.
And
I
recall
now
with
a
sort
of
wonder
that,
in
spite
of
the
infinite
danger
in
which
we
were
between
starvation
and
a
still
more
terrible
death,
we
could
yet
struggle
bitterly
for
that
horrible
privilege
of
sight.
We
would
race
across
the
kitchen
in
a
grotesque
way
between
eagerness
and
the
dread
of
making
a
noise,
and
strike
each
other,
and
thrust
and
kick,
within
a
few
inches
of
exposure.
The
fact
is
that
we
had
absolutely
incompatible
dispositions
and
habits
of
thought
and
action,
and
our
danger
and
isolation
only
accentuated
the
incompatibility.
At
Halliford
I
had
already
come
to
hate
the
curate's
trick
of
helpless
exclamation,
his
stupid
rigidity
of
mind.
His
endless
muttering
monologue
vitiated
every
effort
I
made
to
think
out
a
line
of
action,
and
drove
me
at
times,
thus
pent
up
and
intensified,
almost
to
the
verge
of
craziness.
He
was
as
lacking
in
restraint
as
a
silly
woman.
He
would
weep
for
hours
together,
and
I
verily
believe
that
to
the
very
end
this
spoiled
child
of
life
thought
his
weak
tears
in
some
way
efficacious.
And
I
would
sit
in
the
darkness
unable
to
keep
my
mind
off
him
by
reason
of
his
importunities.
He
ate
more
than
I
did,
and
it
was
in
vain
I
pointed
out
that
our
only
chance
of
life
was
to
stop
in
the
house
until
the
Martians
had
done
with
their
pit,
that
in
that
long
patience
a
time
might
presently
come
when
we
should
need
food.
He
ate
and
drank
impulsively
in
heavy
meals
at
long
intervals.
He
slept
little.
As
the
days
wore
on,
his
utter
carelessness
of
any
consideration
so
intensified
our
distress
and
danger
that
I
had,
much
as
I
loathed
doing
it,
to
resort
to
threats,
and
at
last
to
blows.
That
brought
him
to
reason
for
a
time.
But
he
was
one
of
those
weak
creatures,
void
of
pride,
timorous,
anaemic,
hateful
souls,
full
of
shifty
cunning,
who
face
neither
God
nor
man,
who
face
not
even
themselves.
It
is
disagreeable
for
me
to
recall
and
write
these
things,
but
I
set
them
down
that
my
story
may
lack
nothing.
Those
who
have
escaped
the
dark
and
terrible
aspects
of
life
will
find
my
brutality,
my
flash
of
rage
in
our
final
tragedy,
easy
enough
to
blame;
for
they
know
what
is
wrong
as
well
as
any,
but
not
what
is
possible
to
tortured
men.
But
those
who
have
been
under
the
shadow,
who
have
gone
down
at
last
to
elemental
things,
will
have
a
wider
charity.
And
while
within
we
fought
out
our
dark,
dim
contest
of
whispers,
snatched
food
and
drink,
and
gripping
hands
and
blows,
without,
in
the
pitiless
sunlight
of
that
terrible
June,
was
the
strange
wonder,
the
unfamiliar
routine
of
the
Martians
in
the
pit.
Let
me
return
to
those
first
new
experiences
of
mine.
After
a
long
time
I
ventured
back
to
the
peephole,
to
find
that
the
new-comers
had
been
reinforced
by
the
occupants
of
no
fewer
than
three
of
the
fighting-machines.
These
last
had
brought
with
them
certain
fresh
appliances
that
stood
in
an
orderly
manner
about
the
cylinder.
The
second
handling-machine
was
now
completed,
and
was
busied
in
serving
one
of
the
novel
contrivances
the
big
machine
had
brought.
This
was
a
body
resembling
a
milk
can
in
its
general
form,
above
which
oscillated
a
pear-shaped
receptacle,
and
from
which
a
stream
of
white
powder
flowed
into
a
circular
basin
below.
The
oscillatory
motion
was
imparted
to
this
by
one
tentacle
of
the
handling-machine.
With
two
spatulate
hands
the
handling-machine
was
digging
out
and
flinging
masses
of
clay
into
the
pear-shaped
receptacle
above,
while
with
another
arm
it
periodically
opened
a
door
and
removed
rusty
and
blackened
clinkers
from
the
middle
part
of
the
machine.
Another
steely
tentacle
directed
the
powder
from
the
basin
along
a
ribbed
channel
towards
some
receiver
that
was
hidden
from
me
by
the
mound
of
bluish
dust.
From
this
unseen
receiver
a
little
thread
of
green
smoke
rose
vertically
into
the
quiet
air.
As
I
looked,
the
handling-machine,
with
a
faint
and
musical
clinking,
extended,
telescopic
fashion,
a
tentacle
that
had
been
a
moment
before
a
mere
blunt
projection,
until
its
end
was
hidden
behind
the
mound
of
clay.
In
another
second
it
had
lifted
a
bar
of
white
aluminium
into
sight,
untarnished
as
yet,
and
shining
dazzlingly,
and
deposited
it
in
a
growing
stack
of
bars
that
stood
at
the
side
of
the
pit.
Between
sunset
and
starlight
this
dexterous
machine
must
have
made
more
than
a
hundred
such
bars
out
of
the
crude
clay,
and
the
mound
of
bluish
dust
rose
steadily
until
it
topped
the
side
of
the
pit.
The
contrast
between
the
swift
and
complex
movements
of
these
contrivances
and
the
inert
panting
clumsiness
of
their
masters
was
acute,
and
for
days
I
had
to
tell
myself
repeatedly
that
these
latter
were
indeed
the
living
of
the
two
things.
The
curate
had
possession
of
the
slit
when
the
first
men
were
brought
to
the
pit.
I
was
sitting
below,
huddled
up,
listening
with
all
my
ears.
He
made
a
sudden
movement
backward,
and
I,
fearful
that
we
were
observed,
crouched
in
a
spasm
of
terror.
He
came
sliding
down
the
rubbish
and
crept
beside
me
in
the
darkness,
inarticulate,
gesticulating,
and
for
a
moment
I
shared
his
panic.
His
gesture
suggested
a
resignation
of
the
slit,
and
after
a
little
while
my
curiosity
gave
me
courage,
and
I
rose
up,
stepped
across
him,
and
clambered
up
to
it.
At
first
I
could
see
no
reason
for
his
frantic
behaviour.
The
twilight
had
now
come,
the
stars
were
little
and
faint,
but
the
pit
was
illuminated
by
the
flickering
green
fire
that
came
from
the
aluminium-making.
The
whole
picture
was
a
flickering
scheme
of
green
gleams
and
shifting
rusty
black
shadows,
strangely
trying
to
the
eyes.
Over
and
through
it
all
went
the
bats,
heeding
it
not
at
all.
The
sprawling
Martians
were
no
longer
to
be
seen,
the
mound
of
blue-green
powder
had
risen
to
cover
them
from
sight,
and
a
fighting-machine,
with
its
legs
contracted,
crumpled,
and
abbreviated,
stood
across
the
corner
of
the
pit.
And
then,
amid
the
clangour
of
the
machinery,
came
a
drifting
suspicion
of
human
voices,
that
I
entertained
at
first
only
to
dismiss.
I
crouched,
watching
this
fighting-machine
closely,
satisfying
myself
now
for
the
first
time
that
the
hood
did
indeed
contain
a
Martian.
As
the
green
flames
lifted
I
could
see
the
oily
gleam
of
his
integument
and
the
brightness
of
his
eyes.
And
suddenly
I
heard
a
yell,
and
saw
a
long
tentacle
reaching
over
the
shoulder
of
the
machine
to
the
little
cage
that
hunched
upon
its
back.
Then
something--something
struggling
violently--was
lifted
high
against
the
sky,
a
black,
vague
enigma
against
the
starlight;
and
as
this
black
object
came
down
again,
I
saw
by
the
green
brightness
that
it
was
a
man.
For
an
instant
he
was
clearly
visible.
He
was
a
stout,
ruddy,
middle-aged
man,
well
dressed;
three
days
before,
he
must
have
been
walking
the
world,
a
man
of
considerable
consequence.
I
could
see
his
staring
eyes
and
gleams
of
light
on
his
studs
and
watch
chain.
He
vanished
behind
the
mound,
and
for
a
moment
there
was
silence.
And
then
began
a
shrieking
and
a
sustained
and
cheerful
hooting
from
the
Martians.
I
slid
down
the
rubbish,
struggled
to
my
feet,
clapped
my
hands
over
my
ears,
and
bolted
into
the
scullery.
The
curate,
who
had
been
crouching
silently
with
his
arms
over
his
head,
looked
up
as
I
passed,
cried
out
quite
loudly
at
my
desertion
of
him,
and
came
running
after
me.
That
night,
as
we
lurked
in
the
scullery,
balanced
between
our
horror
and
the
terrible
fascination
this
peeping
had,
although
I
felt
an
urgent
need
of
action
I
tried
in
vain
to
conceive
some
plan
of
escape;
but
afterwards,
during
the
second
day,
I
was
able
to
consider
our
position
with
great
clearness.
The
curate,
I
found,
was
quite
incapable
of
discussion;
this
new
and
culminating
atrocity
had
robbed
him
of
all
vestiges
of
reason
or
forethought.
Practically
he
had
already
sunk
to
the
level
of
an
animal.
But
as
the
saying
goes,
I
gripped
myself
with
both
hands.
It
grew
upon
my
mind,
once
I
could
face
the
facts,
that
terrible
as
our
position
was,
there
was
as
yet
no
justification
for
absolute
despair.
Our
chief
chance
lay
in
the
possibility
of
the
Martians
making
the
pit
nothing
more
than
a
temporary
encampment.
Or
even
if
they
kept
it
permanently,
they
might
not
consider
it
necessary
to
guard
it,
and
a
chance
of
escape
might
be
afforded
us.
I
also
weighed
very
carefully
the
possibility
of
our
digging
a
way
out
in
a
direction
away
from
the
pit,
but
the
chances
of
our
emerging
within
sight
of
some
sentinel
fighting-machine
seemed
at
first
too
great.
And
I
should
have
had
to
do
all
the
digging
myself.
The
curate
would
certainly
have
failed
me.
It
was
on
the
third
day,
if
my
memory
serves
me
right,
that
I
saw
the
lad
killed.
It
was
the
only
occasion
on
which
I
actually
saw
the
Martians
feed.
After
that
experience
I
avoided
the
hole
in
the
wall
for
the
better
part
of
a
day.
I
went
into
the
scullery,
removed
the
door,
and
spent
some
hours
digging
with
my
hatchet
as
silently
as
possible;
but
when
I
had
made
a
hole
about
a
couple
of
feet
deep
the
loose
earth
collapsed
noisily,
and
I
did
not
dare
continue.
I
lost
heart,
and
lay
down
on
the
scullery
floor
for
a
long
time,
having
no
spirit
even
to
move.
And
after
that
I
abandoned
altogether
the
idea
of
escaping
by
excavation.
It
says
much
for
the
impression
the
Martians
had
made
upon
me
that
at
first
I
entertained
little
or
no
hope
of
our
escape
being
brought
about
by
their
overthrow
through
any
human
effort.
But
on
the
fourth
or
fifth
night
I
heard
a
sound
like
heavy
guns.
It
was
very
late
in
the
night,
and
the
moon
was
shining
brightly.
The
Martians
had
taken
away
the
excavating-machine,
and,
save
for
a
fighting-machine
that
stood
in
the
remoter
bank
of
the
pit
and
a
handling-machine
that
was
buried
out
of
my
sight
in
a
corner
of
the
pit
immediately
beneath
my
peephole,
the
place
was
deserted
by
them.
Except
for
the
pale
glow
from
the
handling-machine
and
the
bars
and
patches
of
white
moonlight
the
pit
was
in
darkness,
and,
except
for
the
clinking
of
the
handling-machine,
quite
still.
That
night
was
a
beautiful
serenity;
save
for
one
planet,
the
moon
seemed
to
have
the
sky
to
herself.
I
heard
a
dog
howling,
and
that
familiar
sound
it
was
that
made
me
listen.
Then
I
heard
quite
distinctly
a
booming
exactly
like
the
sound
of
great
guns.
Six
distinct
reports
I
counted,
and
after
a
long
interval
six
again.
And
that
was
all.
CHAPTER
FOUR
THE
DEATH
OF
THE
CURATE
It
was
on
the
sixth
day
of
our
imprisonment
that
I
peeped
for
the
last
time,
and
presently
found
myself
alone.
Instead
of
keeping
close
to
me
and
trying
to
oust
me
from
the
slit,
the
curate
had
gone
back
into
the
scullery.
I
was
struck
by
a
sudden
thought.
I
went
back
quickly
and
quietly
into
the
scullery.
In
the
darkness
I
heard
the
curate
drinking.
I
snatched
in
the
darkness,
and
my
fingers
caught
a
bottle
of
burgundy.
For
a
few
minutes
there
was
a
tussle.
The
bottle
struck
the
floor
and
broke,
and
I
desisted
and
rose.
We
stood
panting
and
threatening
each
other.
In
the
end
I
planted
myself
between
him
and
the
food,
and
told
him
of
my
determination
to
begin
a
discipline.
I
divided
the
food
in
the
pantry,
into
rations
to
last
us
ten
days.
I
would
not
let
him
eat
any
more
that
day.
In
the
afternoon
he
made
a
feeble
effort
to
get
at
the
food.
I
had
been
dozing,
but
in
an
instant
I
was
awake.
All
day
and
all
night
we
sat
face
to
face,
I
weary
but
resolute,
and
he
weeping
and
complaining
of
his
immediate
hunger.
It
was,
I
know,
a
night
and
a
day,
but
to
me
it
seemed--it
seems
now--an
interminable
length
of
time.
And
so
our
widened
incompatibility
ended
at
last
in
open
conflict.
For
two
vast
days
we
struggled
in
undertones
and
wrestling
contests.
There
were
times
when
I
beat
and
kicked
him
madly,
times
when
I
cajoled
and
persuaded
him,
and
once
I
tried
to
bribe
him
with
the
last
bottle
of
burgundy,
for
there
was
a
rain-water
pump
from
which
I
could
get
water.
But
neither
force
nor
kindness
availed;
he
was
indeed
beyond
reason.
He
would
neither
desist
from
his
attacks
on
the
food
nor
from
his
noisy
babbling
to
himself.
The
rudimentary
precautions
to
keep
our
imprisonment
endurable
he
would
not
observe.
Slowly
I
began
to
realise
the
complete
overthrow
of
his
intelligence,
to
perceive
that
my
sole
companion
in
this
close
and
sickly
darkness
was
a
man
insane.
From
certain
vague
memories
I
am
inclined
to
think
my
own
mind
wandered
at
times.
I
had
strange
and
hideous
dreams
whenever
I
slept.
It
sounds
paradoxical,
but
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
weakness
and
insanity
of
the
curate
warned
me,
braced
me,
and
kept
me
a
sane
man.
On
the
eighth
day
he
began
to
talk
aloud
instead
of
whispering,
and
nothing
I
could
do
would
moderate
his
speech.
"It
is
just,
O
God!"
he
would
say,
over
and
over
again.
"It
is
just.
On
me
and
mine
be
the
punishment
laid.
We
have
sinned,
we
have
fallen
short.
There
was
poverty,
sorrow;
the
poor
were
trodden
in
the
dust,
and
I
held
my
peace.
I
preached
acceptable
folly--my
God,
what
folly!--when
I
should
have
stood
up,
though
I
died
for
it,
and
called
upon
them
to
repent--repent!
.
.
.
Oppressors
of
the
poor
and
needy
.
.
.
!
The
wine
press
of
God!"
Then
he
would
suddenly
revert
to
the
matter
of
the
food
I
withheld
from
him,
praying,
begging,
weeping,
at
last
threatening.
He
began
to
raise
his
voice--I
prayed
him
not
to.
He
perceived
a
hold
on
me--he
threatened
he
would
shout
and
bring
the
Martians
upon
us.
For
a
time
that
scared
me;
but
any
concession
would
have
shortened
our
chance
of
escape
beyond
estimating.
I
defied
him,
although
I
felt
no
assurance
that
he
might
not
do
this
thing.
But
that
day,
at
any
rate,
he
did
not.
He
talked
with
his
voice
rising
slowly,
through
the
greater
part
of
the
eighth
and
ninth
days--threats,
entreaties,
mingled
with
a
torrent
of
half-sane
and
always
frothy
repentance
for
his
vacant
sham
of
God's
service,
such
as
made
me
pity
him.
Then
he
slept
awhile,
and
began
again
with
renewed
strength,
so
loudly
that
I
must
needs
make
him
desist.
"Be
still!"
I
implored.
He
rose
to
his
knees,
for
he
had
been
sitting
in
the
darkness
near
the
copper.
"I
have
been
still
too
long,"
he
said,
in
a
tone
that
must
have
reached
the
pit,
"and
now
I
must
bear
my
witness.
Woe
unto
this
unfaithful
city!
Woe!
Woe!
Woe!
Woe!
Woe!
To
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
by
reason
of
the
other
voices
of
the
trumpet----"
"Shut
up!"
I
said,
rising
to
my
feet,
and
in
a
terror
lest
the
Martians
should
hear
us.
"For
God's
sake----"
"Nay,"
shouted
the
curate,
at
the
top
of
his
voice,
standing
likewise
and
extending
his
arms.
"Speak!
The
word
of
the
Lord
is
upon
me!"
In
three
strides
he
was
at
the
door
leading
into
the
kitchen.
"I
must
bear
my
witness!
I
go!
It
has
already
been
too
long
delayed."
I
put
out
my
hand
and
felt
the
meat
chopper
hanging
to
the
wall.
In
a
flash
I
was
after
him.
I
was
fierce
with
fear.
Before
he
was
halfway
across
the
kitchen
I
had
overtaken
him.
With
one
last
touch
of
humanity
I
turned
the
blade
back
and
struck
him
with
the
butt.
He
went
headlong
forward
and
lay
stretched
on
the
ground.
I
stumbled
over
him
and
stood
panting.
He
lay
still.
Suddenly
I
heard
a
noise
without,
the
run
and
smash
of
slipping
plaster,
and
the
triangular
aperture
in
the
wall
was
darkened.
I
looked
up
and
saw
the
lower
surface
of
a
handling-machine
coming
slowly
across
the
hole.
One
of
its
gripping
limbs
curled
amid
the
debris;
another
limb
appeared,
feeling
its
way
over
the
fallen
beams.
I
stood
petrified,
staring.
Then
I
saw
through
a
sort
of
glass
plate
near
the
edge
of
the
body
the
face,
as
we
may
call
it,
and
the
large
dark
eyes
of
a
Martian,
peering,
and
then
a
long
metallic
snake
of
tentacle
came
feeling
slowly
through
the
hole.
I
turned
by
an
effort,
stumbled
over
the
curate,
and
stopped
at
the
scullery
door.
The
tentacle
was
now
some
way,
two
yards
or
more,
in
the
room,
and
twisting
and
turning,
with
queer
sudden
movements,
this
way
and
that.
For
a
while
I
stood
fascinated
by
that
slow,
fitful
advance.
Then,
with
a
faint,
hoarse
cry,
I
forced
myself
across
the
scullery.
I
trembled
violently;
I
could
scarcely
stand
upright.
I
opened
the
door
of
the
coal
cellar,
and
stood
there
in
the
darkness
staring
at
the
faintly
lit
doorway
into
the
kitchen,
and
listening.
Had
the
Martian
seen
me?
What
was
it
doing
now?
Something
was
moving
to
and
fro
there,
very
quietly;
every
now
and
then
it
tapped
against
the
wall,
or
started
on
its
movements
with
a
faint
metallic
ringing,
like
the
movements
of
keys
on
a
split-ring.
Then
a
heavy
body--I
knew
too
well
what--was
dragged
across
the
floor
of
the
kitchen
towards
the
opening.
Irresistibly
attracted,
I
crept
to
the
door
and
peeped
into
the
kitchen.
In
the
triangle
of
bright
outer
sunlight
I
saw
the
Martian,
in
its
Briareus
of
a
handling-machine,
scrutinizing
the
curate's
head.
I
thought
at
once
that
it
would
infer
my
presence
from
the
mark
of
the
blow
I
had
given
him.
I
crept
back
to
the
coal
cellar,
shut
the
door,
and
began
to
cover
myself
up
as
much
as
I
could,
and
as
noiselessly
as
possible
in
the
darkness,
among
the
firewood
and
coal
therein.
Every
now
and
then
I
paused,
rigid,
to
hear
if
the
Martian
had
thrust
its
tentacles
through
the
opening
again.
Then
the
faint
metallic
jingle
returned.
I
traced
it
slowly
feeling
over
the
kitchen.
Presently
I
heard
it
nearer--in
the
scullery,
as
I
judged.
I
thought
that
its
length
might
be
insufficient
to
reach
me.
I
prayed
copiously.
It
passed,
scraping
faintly
across
the
cellar
door.
An
age
of
almost
intolerable
suspense
intervened;
then
I
heard
it
fumbling
at
the
latch!
It
had
found
the
door!
The
Martians
understood
doors!
It
worried
at
the
catch
for
a
minute,
perhaps,
and
then
the
door
opened.
In
the
darkness
I
could
just
see
the
thing--like
an
elephant's
trunk
more
than
anything
else--waving
towards
me
and
touching
and
examining
the
wall,
coals,
wood
and
ceiling.
It
was
like
a
black
worm
swaying
its
blind
head
to
and
fro.
Once,
even,
it
touched
the
heel
of
my
boot.
I
was
on
the
verge
of
screaming;
I
bit
my
hand.
For
a
time
the
tentacle
was
silent.
I
could
have
fancied
it
had
been
withdrawn.
Presently,
with
an
abrupt
click,
it
gripped
something--I
thought
it
had
me!--and
seemed
to
go
out
of
the
cellar
again.
For
a
minute
I
was
not
sure.
Apparently
it
had
taken
a
lump
of
coal
to
examine.
I
seized
the
opportunity
of
slightly
shifting
my
position,
which
had
become
cramped,
and
then
listened.
I
whispered
passionate
prayers
for
safety.
Then
I
heard
the
slow,
deliberate
sound
creeping
towards
me
again.
Slowly,
slowly
it
drew
near,
scratching
against
the
walls
and
tapping
the
furniture.
While
I
was
still
doubtful,
it
rapped
smartly
against
the
cellar
door
and
closed
it.
I
heard
it
go
into
the
pantry,
and
the
biscuit-tins
rattled
and
a
bottle
smashed,
and
then
came
a
heavy
bump
against
the
cellar
door.
Then
silence
that
passed
into
an
infinity
of
suspense.
Had
it
gone?
At
last
I
decided
that
it
had.
It
came
into
the
scullery
no
more;
but
I
lay
all
the
tenth
day
in
the
close
darkness,
buried
among
coals
and
firewood,
not
daring
even
to
crawl
out
for
the
drink
for
which
I
craved.
It
was
the
eleventh
day
before
I
ventured
so
far
from
my
security.
CHAPTER
FIVE
THE
STILLNESS
My
first
act
before
I
went
into
the
pantry
was
to
fasten
the
door
between
the
kitchen
and
the
scullery.
But
the
pantry
was
empty;
every
scrap
of
food
had
gone.
Apparently,
the
Martian
had
taken
it
all
on
the
previous
day.
At
that
discovery
I
despaired
for
the
first
time.
I
took
no
food,
or
no
drink
either,
on
the
eleventh
or
the
twelfth
day.
At
first
my
mouth
and
throat
were
parched,
and
my
strength
ebbed
sensibly.
I
sat
about
in
the
darkness
of
the
scullery,
in
a
state
of
despondent
wretchedness.
My
mind
ran
on
eating.
I
thought
I
had
become
deaf,
for
the
noises
of
movement
I
had
been
accustomed
to
hear
from
the
pit
had
ceased
absolutely.
I
did
not
feel
strong
enough
to
crawl
noiselessly
to
the
peephole,
or
I
would
have
gone
there.
On
the
twelfth
day
my
throat
was
so
painful
that,
taking
the
chance
of
alarming
the
Martians,
I
attacked
the
creaking
rain-water
pump
that
stood
by
the
sink,
and
got
a
couple
of
glassfuls
of
blackened
and
tainted
rain
water.
I
was
greatly
refreshed
by
this,
and
emboldened
by
the
fact
that
no
enquiring
tentacle
followed
the
noise
of
my
pumping.
During
these
days,
in
a
rambling,
inconclusive
way,
I
thought
much
of
the
curate
and
of
the
manner
of
his
death.
On
the
thirteenth
day
I
drank
some
more
water,
and
dozed
and
thought
disjointedly
of
eating
and
of
vague
impossible
plans
of
escape.
Whenever
I
dozed
I
dreamt
of
horrible
phantasms,
of
the
death
of
the
curate,
or
of
sumptuous
dinners;
but,
asleep
or
awake,
I
felt
a
keen
pain
that
urged
me
to
drink
again
and
again.
The
light
that
came
into
the
scullery
was
no
longer
grey,
but
red.
To
my
disordered
imagination
it
seemed
the
colour
of
blood.
On
the
fourteenth
day
I
went
into
the
kitchen,
and
I
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
fronds
of
the
red
weed
had
grown
right
across
the
hole
in
the
wall,
turning
the
half-light
of
the
place
into
a
crimson-coloured
obscurity.
It
was
early
on
the
fifteenth
day
that
I
heard
a
curious,
familiar
sequence
of
sounds
in
the
kitchen,
and,
listening,
identified
it
as
the
snuffing
and
scratching
of
a
dog.
Going
into
the
kitchen,
I
saw
a
dog's
nose
peering
in
through
a
break
among
the
ruddy
fronds.
This
greatly
surprised
me.
At
the
scent
of
me
he
barked
shortly.
I
thought
if
I
could
induce
him
to
come
into
the
place
quietly
I
should
be
able,
perhaps,
to
kill
and
eat
him;
and
in
any
case,
it
would
be
advisable
to
kill
him,
lest
his
actions
attracted
the
attention
of
the
Martians.
I
crept
forward,
saying
"Good
dog!"
very
softly;
but
he
suddenly
withdrew
his
head
and
disappeared.
I
listened--I
was
not
deaf--but
certainly
the
pit
was
still.
I
heard
a
sound
like
the
flutter
of
a
bird's
wings,
and
a
hoarse
croaking,
but
that
was
all.
For
a
long
while
I
lay
close
to
the
peephole,
but
not
daring
to
move
aside
the
red
plants
that
obscured
it.
Once
or
twice
I
heard
a
faint
pitter-patter
like
the
feet
of
the
dog
going
hither
and
thither
on
the
sand
far
below
me,
and
there
were
more
birdlike
sounds,
but
that
was
all.
At
length,
encouraged
by
the
silence,
I
looked
out.
Except
in
the
corner,
where
a
multitude
of
crows
hopped
and
fought
over
the
skeletons
of
the
dead
the
Martians
had
consumed,
there
was
not
a
living
thing
in
the
pit.
I
stared
about
me,
scarcely
believing
my
eyes.
All
the
machinery
had
gone.
Save
for
the
big
mound
of
greyish-blue
powder
in
one
corner,
certain
bars
of
aluminium
in
another,
the
black
birds,
and
the
skeletons
of
the
killed,
the
place
was
merely
an
empty
circular
pit
in
the
sand.
Slowly
I
thrust
myself
out
through
the
red
weed,
and
stood
upon
the
mound
of
rubble.
I
could
see
in
any
direction
save
behind
me,
to
the
north,
and
neither
Martians
nor
sign
of
Martians
were
to
be
seen.
The
pit
dropped
sheerly
from
my
feet,
but
a
little
way
along
the
rubbish
afforded
a
practicable
slope
to
the
summit
of
the
ruins.
My
chance
of
escape
had
come.
I
began
to
tremble.
I
hesitated
for
some
time,
and
then,
in
a
gust
of
desperate
resolution,
and
with
a
heart
that
throbbed
violently,
I
scrambled
to
the
top
of
the
mound
in
which
I
had
been
buried
so
long.
I
looked
about
again.
To
the
northward,
too,
no
Martian
was
visible.
When
I
had
last
seen
this
part
of
Sheen
in
the
daylight
it
had
been
a
straggling
street
of
comfortable
white
and
red
houses,
interspersed
with
abundant
shady
trees.
Now
I
stood
on
a
mound
of
smashed
brickwork,
clay,
and
gravel,
over
which
spread
a
multitude
of
red
cactus-shaped
plants,
knee-high,
without
a
solitary
terrestrial
growth
to
dispute
their
footing.
The
trees
near
me
were
dead
and
brown,
but
further
a
network
of
red
thread
scaled
the
still
living
stems.
The
neighbouring
houses
had
all
been
wrecked,
but
none
had
been
burned;
their
walls
stood,
sometimes
to
the
second
story,
with
smashed
windows
and
shattered
doors.
The
red
weed
grew
tumultuously
in
their
roofless
rooms.
Below
me
was
the
great
pit,
with
the
crows
struggling
for
its
refuse.
A
number
of
other
birds
hopped
about
among
the
ruins.
Far
away
I
saw
a
gaunt
cat
slink
crouchingly
along
a
wall,
but
traces
of
men
there
were
none.
The
day
seemed,
by
contrast
with
my
recent
confinement,
dazzlingly
bright,
the
sky
a
glowing
blue.
A
gentle
breeze
kept
the
red
weed
that
covered
every
scrap
of
unoccupied
ground
gently
swaying.
And
oh!
the
sweetness
of
the
air!
CHAPTER
SIX
THE
WORK
OF
FIFTEEN
DAYS
For
some
time
I
stood
tottering
on
the
mound
regardless
of
my
safety.
Within
that
noisome
den
from
which
I
had
emerged
I
had
thought
with
a
narrow
intensity
only
of
our
immediate
security.
I
had
not
realised
what
had
been
happening
to
the
world,
had
not
anticipated
this
startling
vision
of
unfamiliar
things.
I
had
expected
to
see
Sheen
in
ruins--I
found
about
me
the
landscape,
weird
and
lurid,
of
another
planet.
For
that
moment
I
touched
an
emotion
beyond
the
common
range
of
men,
yet
one
that
the
poor
brutes
we
dominate
know
only
too
well.
I
felt
as
a
rabbit
might
feel
returning
to
his
burrow
and
suddenly
confronted
by
the
work
of
a
dozen
busy
navvies
digging
the
foundations
of
a
house.
I
felt
the
first
inkling
of
a
thing
that
presently
grew
quite
clear
in
my
mind,
that
oppressed
me
for
many
days,
a
sense
of
dethronement,
a
persuasion
that
I
was
no
longer
a
master,
but
an
animal
among
the
animals,
under
the
Martian
heel.
With
us
it
would
be
as
with
them,
to
lurk
and
watch,
to
run
and
hide;
the
fear
and
empire
of
man
had
passed
away.
But
so
soon
as
this
strangeness
had
been
realised
it
passed,
and
my
dominant
motive
became
the
hunger
of
my
long
and
dismal
fast.
In
the
direction
away
from
the
pit
I
saw,
beyond
a
red-covered
wall,
a
patch
of
garden
ground
unburied.
This
gave
me
a
hint,
and
I
went
knee-deep,
and
sometimes
neck-deep,
in
the
red
weed.
The
density
of
the
weed
gave
me
a
reassuring
sense
of
hiding.
The
wall
was
some
six
feet
high,
and
when
I
attempted
to
clamber
it
I
found
I
could
not
lift
my
feet
to
the
crest.
So
I
went
along
by
the
side
of
it,
and
came
to
a
corner
and
a
rockwork
that
enabled
me
to
get
to
the
top,
and
tumble
into
the
garden
I
coveted.
Here
I
found
some
young
onions,
a
couple
of
gladiolus
bulbs,
and
a
quantity
of
immature
carrots,
all
of
which
I
secured,
and,
scrambling
over
a
ruined
wall,
went
on
my
way
through
scarlet
and
crimson
trees
towards
Kew--it
was
like
walking
through
an
avenue
of
gigantic
blood
drops--possessed
with
two
ideas:
to
get
more
food,
and
to
limp,
as
soon
and
as
far
as
my
strength
permitted,
out
of
this
accursed
unearthly
region
of
the
pit.
Some
way
farther,
in
a
grassy
place,
was
a
group
of
mushrooms
which
also
I
devoured,
and
then
I
came
upon
a
brown
sheet
of
flowing
shallow
water,
where
meadows
used
to
be.
These
fragments
of
nourishment
served
only
to
whet
my
hunger.
At
first
I
was
surprised
at
this
flood
in
a
hot,
dry
summer,
but
afterwards
I
discovered
that
it
was
caused
by
the
tropical
exuberance
of
the
red
weed.
Directly
this
extraordinary
growth
encountered
water
it
straightway
became
gigantic
and
of
unparalleled
fecundity.
Its
seeds
were
simply
poured
down
into
the
water
of
the
Wey
and
Thames,
and
its
swiftly
growing
and
Titanic
water
fronds
speedily
choked
both
those
rivers.
At
Putney,
as
I
afterwards
saw,
the
bridge
was
almost
lost
in
a
tangle
of
this
weed,
and
at
Richmond,
too,
the
Thames
water
poured
in
a
broad
and
shallow
stream
across
the
meadows
of
Hampton
and
Twickenham.
As
the
water
spread
the
weed
followed
them,
until
the
ruined
villas
of
the
Thames
valley
were
for
a
time
lost
in
this
red
swamp,
whose
margin
I
explored,
and
much
of
the
desolation
the
Martians
had
caused
was
concealed.
In
the
end
the
red
weed
succumbed
almost
as
quickly
as
it
had
spread.
A
cankering
disease,
due,
it
is
believed,
to
the
action
of
certain
bacteria,
presently
seized
upon
it.
Now
by
the
action
of
natural
selection,
all
terrestrial
plants
have
acquired
a
resisting
power
against
bacterial
diseases--they
never
succumb
without
a
severe
struggle,
but
the
red
weed
rotted
like
a
thing
already
dead.
The
fronds
became
bleached,
and
then
shrivelled
and
brittle.
They
broke
off
at
the
least
touch,
and
the
waters
that
had
stimulated
their
early
growth
carried
their
last
vestiges
out
to
sea.
My
first
act
on
coming
to
this
water
was,
of
course,
to
slake
my
thirst.
I
drank
a
great
deal
of
it
and,
moved
by
an
impulse,
gnawed
some
fronds
of
red
weed;
but
they
were
watery,
and
had
a
sickly,
metallic
taste.
I
found
the
water
was
sufficiently
shallow
for
me
to
wade
securely,
although
the
red
weed
impeded
my
feet
a
little;
but
the
flood
evidently
got
deeper
towards
the
river,
and
I
turned
back
to
Mortlake.
I
managed
to
make
out
the
road
by
means
of
occasional
ruins
of
its
villas
and
fences
and
lamps,
and
so
presently
I
got
out
of
this
spate
and
made
my
way
to
the
hill
going
up
towards
Roehampton
and
came
out
on
Putney
Common.
Here
the
scenery
changed
from
the
strange
and
unfamiliar
to
the
wreckage
of
the
familiar:
patches
of
ground
exhibited
the
devastation
of
a
cyclone,
and
in
a
few
score
yards
I
would
come
upon
perfectly
undisturbed
spaces,
houses
with
their
blinds
trimly
drawn
and
doors
closed,
as
if
they
had
been
left
for
a
day
by
the
owners,
or
as
if
their
inhabitants
slept
within.
The
red
weed
was
less
abundant;
the
tall
trees
along
the
lane
were
free
from
the
red
creeper.
I
hunted
for
food
among
the
trees,
finding
nothing,
and
I
also
raided
a
couple
of
silent
houses,
but
they
had
already
been
broken
into
and
ransacked.
I
rested
for
the
remainder
of
the
daylight
in
a
shrubbery,
being,
in
my
enfeebled
condition,
too
fatigued
to
push
on.
All
this
time
I
saw
no
human
beings,
and
no
signs
of
the
Martians.
I
encountered
a
couple
of
hungry-looking
dogs,
but
both
hurried
circuitously
away
from
the
advances
I
made
them.
Near
Roehampton
I
had
seen
two
human
skeletons--not
bodies,
but
skeletons,
picked
clean--and
in
the
wood
by
me
I
found
the
crushed
and
scattered
bones
of
several
cats
and
rabbits
and
the
skull
of
a
sheep.
But
though
I
gnawed
parts
of
these
in
my
mouth,
there
was
nothing
to
be
got
from
them.
After
sunset
I
struggled
on
along
the
road
towards
Putney,
where
I
think
the
Heat-Ray
must
have
been
used
for
some
reason.
And
in
the
garden
beyond
Roehampton
I
got
a
quantity
of
immature
potatoes,
sufficient
to
stay
my
hunger.
From
this
garden
one
looked
down
upon
Putney
and
the
river.
The
aspect
of
the
place
in
the
dusk
was
singularly
desolate:
blackened
trees,
blackened,
desolate
ruins,
and
down
the
hill
the
sheets
of
the
flooded
river,
red-tinged
with
the
weed.
And
over
all--silence.
It
filled
me
with
indescribable
terror
to
think
how
swiftly
that
desolating
change
had
come.
For
a
time
I
believed
that
mankind
had
been
swept
out
of
existence,
and
that
I
stood
there
alone,
the
last
man
left
alive.
Hard
by
the
top
of
Putney
Hill
I
came
upon
another
skeleton,
with
the
arms
dislocated
and
removed
several
yards
from
the
rest
of
the
body.
As
I
proceeded
I
became
more
and
more
convinced
that
the
extermination
of
mankind
was,
save
for
such
stragglers
as
myself,
already
accomplished
in
this
part
of
the
world.
The
Martians,
I
thought,
had
gone
on
and
left
the
country
desolated,
seeking
food
elsewhere.
Perhaps
even
now
they
were
destroying
Berlin
or
Paris,
or
it
might
be
they
had
gone
northward.
CHAPTER
SEVEN
THE
MAN
ON
PUTNEY
HILL
I
spent
that
night
in
the
inn
that
stands
at
the
top
of
Putney
Hill,
sleeping
in
a
made
bed
for
the
first
time
since
my
flight
to
Leatherhead.
I
will
not
tell
the
needless
trouble
I
had
breaking
into
that
house--afterwards
I
found
the
front
door
was
on
the
latch--nor
how
I
ransacked
every
room
for
food,
until
just
on
the
verge
of
despair,
in
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
servant's
bedroom,
I
found
a
rat-gnawed
crust
and
two
tins
of
pineapple.
The
place
had
been
already
searched
and
emptied.
In
the
bar
I
afterwards
found
some
biscuits
and
sandwiches
that
had
been
overlooked.
The
latter
I
could
not
eat,
they
were
too
rotten,
but
the
former
not
only
stayed
my
hunger,
but
filled
my
pockets.
I
lit
no
lamps,
fearing
some
Martian
might
come
beating
that
part
of
London
for
food
in
the
night.
Before
I
went
to
bed
I
had
an
interval
of
restlessness,
and
prowled
from
window
to
window,
peering
out
for
some
sign
of
these
monsters.
I
slept
little.
As
I
lay
in
bed
I
found
myself
thinking
consecutively--a
thing
I
do
not
remember
to
have
done
since
my
last
argument
with
the
curate.
During
all
the
intervening
time
my
mental
condition
had
been
a
hurrying
succession
of
vague
emotional
states
or
a
sort
of
stupid
receptivity.
But
in
the
night
my
brain,
reinforced,
I
suppose,
by
the
food
I
had
eaten,
grew
clear
again,
and
I
thought.
Three
things
struggled
for
possession
of
my
mind:
the
killing
of
the
curate,
the
whereabouts
of
the
Martians,
and
the
possible
fate
of
my
wife.
The
former
gave
me
no
sensation
of
horror
or
remorse
to
recall;
I
saw
it
simply
as
a
thing
done,
a
memory
infinitely
disagreeable
but
quite
without
the
quality
of
remorse.
I
saw
myself
then
as
I
see
myself
now,
driven
step
by
step
towards
that
hasty
blow,
the
creature
of
a
sequence
of
accidents
leading
inevitably
to
that.
I
felt
no
condemnation;
yet
the
memory,
static,
unprogressive,
haunted
me.
In
the
silence
of
the
night,
with
that
sense
of
the
nearness
of
God
that
sometimes
comes
into
the
stillness
and
the
darkness,
I
stood
my
trial,
my
only
trial,
for
that
moment
of
wrath
and
fear.
I
retraced
every
step
of
our
conversation
from
the
moment
when
I
had
found
him
crouching
beside
me,
heedless
of
my
thirst,
and
pointing
to
the
fire
and
smoke
that
streamed
up
from
the
ruins
of
Weybridge.
We
had
been
incapable
of
co-operation--grim
chance
had
taken
no
heed
of
that.
Had
I
foreseen,
I
should
have
left
him
at
Halliford.
But
I
did
not
foresee;
and
crime
is
to
foresee
and
do.
And
I
set
this
down
as
I
have
set
all
this
story
down,
as
it
was.
There
were
no
witnesses--all
these
things
I
might
have
concealed.
But
I
set
it
down,
and
the
reader
must
form
his
judgment
as
he
will.
And
when,
by
an
effort,
I
had
set
aside
that
picture
of
a
prostrate
body,
I
faced
the
problem
of
the
Martians
and
the
fate
of
my
wife.
For
the
former
I
had
no
data;
I
could
imagine
a
hundred
things,
and
so,
unhappily,
I
could
for
the
latter.
And
suddenly
that
night
became
terrible.
I
found
myself
sitting
up
in
bed,
staring
at
the
dark.
I
found
myself
praying
that
the
Heat-Ray
might
have
suddenly
and
painlessly
struck
her
out
of
being.
Since
the
night
of
my
return
from
Leatherhead
I
had
not
prayed.
I
had
uttered
prayers,
fetish
prayers,
had
prayed
as
heathens
mutter
charms
when
I
was
in
extremity;
but
now
I
prayed
indeed,
pleading
steadfastly
and
sanely,
face
to
face
with
the
darkness
of
God.
Strange
night!
Strangest
in
this,
that
so
soon
as
dawn
had
come,
I,
who
had
talked
with
God,
crept
out
of
the
house
like
a
rat
leaving
its
hiding
place--a
creature
scarcely
larger,
an
inferior
animal,
a
thing
that
for
any
passing
whim
of
our
masters
might
be
hunted
and
killed.
Perhaps
they
also
prayed
confidently
to
God.
Surely,
if
we
have
learned
nothing
else,
this
war
has
taught
us
pity--pity
for
those
witless
souls
that
suffer
our
dominion.
The
morning
was
bright
and
fine,
and
the
eastern
sky
glowed
pink,
and
was
fretted
with
little
golden
clouds.
In
the
road
that
runs
from
the
top
of
Putney
Hill
to
Wimbledon
was
a
number
of
poor
vestiges
of
the
panic
torrent
that
must
have
poured
Londonward
on
the
Sunday
night
after
the
fighting
began.
There
was
a
little
two-wheeled
cart
inscribed
with
the
name
of
Thomas
Lobb,
Greengrocer,
New
Malden,
with
a
smashed
wheel
and
an
abandoned
tin
trunk;
there
was
a
straw
hat
trampled
into
the
now
hardened
mud,
and
at
the
top
of
West
Hill
a
lot
of
blood-stained
glass
about
the
overturned
water
trough.
My
movements
were
languid,
my
plans
of
the
vaguest.
I
had
an
idea
of
going
to
Leatherhead,
though
I
knew
that
there
I
had
the
poorest
chance
of
finding
my
wife.
Certainly,
unless
death
had
overtaken
them
suddenly,
my
cousins
and
she
would
have
fled
thence;
but
it
seemed
to
me
I
might
find
or
learn
there
whither
the
Surrey
people
had
fled.
I
knew
I
wanted
to
find
my
wife,
that
my
heart
ached
for
her
and
the
world
of
men,
but
I
had
no
clear
idea
how
the
finding
might
be
done.
I
was
also
sharply
aware
now
of
my
intense
loneliness.
From
the
corner
I
went,
under
cover
of
a
thicket
of
trees
and
bushes,
to
the
edge
of
Wimbledon
Common,
stretching
wide
and
far.
That
dark
expanse
was
lit
in
patches
by
yellow
gorse
and
broom;
there
was
no
red
weed
to
be
seen,
and
as
I
prowled,
hesitating,
on
the
verge
of
the
open,
the
sun
rose,
flooding
it
all
with
light
and
vitality.
I
came
upon
a
busy
swarm
of
little
frogs
in
a
swampy
place
among
the
trees.
I
stopped
to
look
at
them,
drawing
a
lesson
from
their
stout
resolve
to
live.
And
presently,
turning
suddenly,
with
an
odd
feeling
of
being
watched,
I
beheld
something
crouching
amid
a
clump
of
bushes.
I
stood
regarding
this.
I
made
a
step
towards
it,
and
it
rose
up
and
became
a
man
armed
with
a
cutlass.
I
approached
him
slowly.
He
stood
silent
and
motionless,
regarding
me.
As
I
drew
nearer
I
perceived
he
was
dressed
in
clothes
as
dusty
and
filthy
as
my
own;
he
looked,
indeed,
as
though
he
had
been
dragged
through
a
culvert.
Nearer,
I
distinguished
the
green
slime
of
ditches
mixing
with
the
pale
drab
of
dried
clay
and
shiny,
coaly
patches.
His
black
hair
fell
over
his
eyes,
and
his
face
was
dark
and
dirty
and
sunken,
so
that
at
first
I
did
not
recognise
him.
There
was
a
red
cut
across
the
lower
part
of
his
face.
"Stop!"
he
cried,
when
I
was
within
ten
yards
of
him,
and
I
stopped.
His
voice
was
hoarse.
"Where
do
you
come
from?"
he
said.
I
thought,
surveying
him.
"I
come
from
Mortlake,"
I
said.
"I
was
buried
near
the
pit
the
Martians
made
about
their
cylinder.
I
have
worked
my
way
out
and
escaped."
"There
is
no
food
about
here,"
he
said.
"This
is
my
country.
All
this
hill
down
to
the
river,
and
back
to
Clapham,
and
up
to
the
edge
of
the
common.
There
is
only
food
for
one.
Which
way
are
you
going?"
I
answered
slowly.
"I
don't
know,"
I
said.
"I
have
been
buried
in
the
ruins
of
a
house
thirteen
or
fourteen
days.
I
don't
know
what
has
happened."
He
looked
at
me
doubtfully,
then
started,
and
looked
with
a
changed
expression.
"I've
no
wish
to
stop
about
here,"
said
I.
"I
think
I
shall
go
to
Leatherhead,
for
my
wife
was
there."
He
shot
out
a
pointing
finger.
"It
is
you,"
said
he;
"the
man
from
Woking.
And
you
weren't
killed
at
Weybridge?"
I
recognised
him
at
the
same
moment.
"You
are
the
artilleryman
who
came
into
my
garden."
"Good
luck!"
he
said.
"We
are
lucky
ones!
Fancy
_you_!"
He
put
out
a
hand,
and
I
took
it.
"I
crawled
up
a
drain,"
he
said.
"But
they
didn't
kill
everyone.
And
after
they
went
away
I
got
off
towards
Walton
across
the
fields.
But----
It's
not
sixteen
days
altogether--and
your
hair
is
grey."
He
looked
over
his
shoulder
suddenly.
"Only
a
rook,"
he
said.
"One
gets
to
know
that
birds
have
shadows
these
days.
This
is
a
bit
open.
Let
us
crawl
under
those
bushes
and
talk."
"Have
you
seen
any
Martians?"
I
said.
"Since
I
crawled
out----"
"They've
gone
away
across
London,"
he
said.
"I
guess
they've
got
a
bigger
camp
there.
Of
a
night,
all
over
there,
Hampstead
way,
the
sky
is
alive
with
their
lights.
It's
like
a
great
city,
and
in
the
glare
you
can
just
see
them
moving.
By
daylight
you
can't.
But
nearer--I
haven't
seen
them--"
(he
counted
on
his
fingers)
"five
days.
Then
I
saw
a
couple
across
Hammersmith
way
carrying
something
big.
And
the
night
before
last"--he
stopped
and
spoke
impressively--"it
was
just
a
matter
of
lights,
but
it
was
something
up
in
the
air.
I
believe
they've
built
a
flying-machine,
and
are
learning
to
fly."
I
stopped,
on
hands
and
knees,
for
we
had
come
to
the
bushes.
"Fly!"
"Yes,"
he
said,
"fly."
I
went
on
into
a
little
bower,
and
sat
down.
"It
is
all
over
with
humanity,"
I
said.
"If
they
can
do
that
they
will
simply
go
round
the
world."
He
nodded.
"They
will.
But----
It
will
relieve
things
over
here
a
bit.
And
besides----"
He
looked
at
me.
"Aren't
you
satisfied
it
_is_
up
with
humanity?
I
am.
We're
down;
we're
beat."
I
stared.
Strange
as
it
may
seem,
I
had
not
arrived
at
this
fact--a
fact
perfectly
obvious
so
soon
as
he
spoke.
I
had
still
held
a
vague
hope;
rather,
I
had
kept
a
lifelong
habit
of
mind.
He
repeated
his
words,
"We're
beat."
They
carried
absolute
conviction.
"It's
all
over,"
he
said.
"They've
lost
_one_--just
_one_.
And
they've
made
their
footing
good
and
crippled
the
greatest
power
in
the
world.
They've
walked
over
us.
The
death
of
that
one
at
Weybridge
was
an
accident.
And
these
are
only
pioneers.
They
kept
on
coming.
These
green
stars--I've
seen
none
these
five
or
six
days,
but
I've
no
doubt
they're
falling
somewhere
every
night.
Nothing's
to
be
done.
We're
under!
We're
beat!"
I
made
him
no
answer.
I
sat
staring
before
me,
trying
in
vain
to
devise
some
countervailing
thought.
"This
isn't
a
war,"
said
the
artilleryman.
"It
never
was
a
war,
any
more
than
there's
war
between
man
and
ants."
Suddenly
I
recalled
the
night
in
the
observatory.
"After
the
tenth
shot
they
fired
no
more--at
least,
until
the
first
cylinder
came."
"How
do
you
know?"
said
the
artilleryman.
I
explained.
He
thought.
"Something
wrong
with
the
gun,"
he
said.
"But
what
if
there
is?
They'll
get
it
right
again.
And
even
if
there's
a
delay,
how
can
it
alter
the
end?
It's
just
men
and
ants.
There's
the
ants
builds
their
cities,
live
their
lives,
have
wars,
revolutions,
until
the
men
want
them
out
of
the
way,
and
then
they
go
out
of
the
way.
That's
what
we
are
now--just
ants.
Only----"
"Yes,"
I
said.
"We're
eatable
ants."
We
sat
looking
at
each
other.
"And
what
will
they
do
with
us?"
I
said.
"That's
what
I've
been
thinking,"
he
said;
"that's
what
I've
been
thinking.
After
Weybridge
I
went
south--thinking.
I
saw
what
was
up.
Most
of
the
people
were
hard
at
it
squealing
and
exciting
themselves.
But
I'm
not
so
fond
of
squealing.
I've
been
in
sight
of
death
once
or
twice;
I'm
not
an
ornamental
soldier,
and
at
the
best
and
worst,
death--it's
just
death.
And
it's
the
man
that
keeps
on
thinking
comes
through.
I
saw
everyone
tracking
away
south.
Says
I,
'Food
won't
last
this
way,'
and
I
turned
right
back.
I
went
for
the
Martians
like
a
sparrow
goes
for
man.
All
round"--he
waved
a
hand
to
the
horizon--"they're
starving
in
heaps,
bolting,
treading
on
each
other.
.
.
."
He
saw
my
face,
and
halted
awkwardly.
"No
doubt
lots
who
had
money
have
gone
away
to
France,"
he
said.
He
seemed
to
hesitate
whether
to
apologise,
met
my
eyes,
and
went
on:
"There's
food
all
about
here.
Canned
things
in
shops;
wines,
spirits,
mineral
waters;
and
the
water
mains
and
drains
are
empty.
Well,
I
was
telling
you
what
I
was
thinking.
'Here's
intelligent
things,'
I
said,
'and
it
seems
they
want
us
for
food.
First,
they'll
smash
us
up--ships,
machines,
guns,
cities,
all
the
order
and
organisation.
All
that
will
go.
If
we
were
the
size
of
ants
we
might
pull
through.
But
we're
not.
It's
all
too
bulky
to
stop.
That's
the
first
certainty.'
Eh?"
I
assented.
"It
is;
I've
thought
it
out.
Very
well,
then--next;
at
present
we're
caught
as
we're
wanted.
A
Martian
has
only
to
go
a
few
miles
to
get
a
crowd
on
the
run.
And
I
saw
one,
one
day,
out
by
Wandsworth,
picking
houses
to
pieces
and
routing
among
the
wreckage.
But
they
won't
keep
on
doing
that.
So
soon
as
they've
settled
all
our
guns
and
ships,
and
smashed
our
railways,
and
done
all
the
things
they
are
doing
over
there,
they
will
begin
catching
us
systematic,
picking
the
best
and
storing
us
in
cages
and
things.
That's
what
they
will
start
doing
in
a
bit.
Lord!
They
haven't
begun
on
us
yet.
Don't
you
see
that?"
"Not
begun!"
I
exclaimed.
"Not
begun.
All
that's
happened
so
far
is
through
our
not
having
the
sense
to
keep
quiet--worrying
them
with
guns
and
such
foolery.
And
losing
our
heads,
and
rushing
off
in
crowds
to
where
there
wasn't
any
more
safety
than
where
we
were.
They
don't
want
to
bother
us
yet.
They're
making
their
things--making
all
the
things
they
couldn't
bring
with
them,
getting
things
ready
for
the
rest
of
their
people.
Very
likely
that's
why
the
cylinders
have
stopped
for
a
bit,
for
fear
of
hitting
those
who
are
here.
And
instead
of
our
rushing
about
blind,
on
the
howl,
or
getting
dynamite
on
the
chance
of
busting
them
up,
we've
got
to
fix
ourselves
up
according
to
the
new
state
of
affairs.
That's
how
I
figure
it
out.
It
isn't
quite
according
to
what
a
man
wants
for
his
species,
but
it's
about
what
the
facts
point
to.
And
that's
the
principle
I
acted
upon.
Cities,
nations,
civilisation,
progress--it's
all
over.
That
game's
up.
We're
beat."
"But
if
that
is
so,
what
is
there
to
live
for?"
The
artilleryman
looked
at
me
for
a
moment.
"There
won't
be
any
more
blessed
concerts
for
a
million
years
or
so;
there
won't
be
any
Royal
Academy
of
Arts,
and
no
nice
little
feeds
at
restaurants.
If
it's
amusement
you're
after,
I
reckon
the
game
is
up.
If
you've
got
any
drawing-room
manners
or
a
dislike
to
eating
peas
with
a
knife
or
dropping
aitches,
you'd
better
chuck
'em
away.
They
ain't
no
further
use."
"You
mean----"
"I
mean
that
men
like
me
are
going
on
living--for
the
sake
of
the
breed.
I
tell
you,
I'm
grim
set
on
living.
And
if
I'm
not
mistaken,
you'll
show
what
insides
_you've_
got,
too,
before
long.
We
aren't
going
to
be
exterminated.
And
I
don't
mean
to
be
caught
either,
and
tamed
and
fattened
and
bred
like
a
thundering
ox.
Ugh!
Fancy
those
brown
creepers!"
"You
don't
mean
to
say----"
"I
do.
I'm
going
on,
under
their
feet.
I've
got
it
planned;
I've
thought
it
out.
We
men
are
beat.
We
don't
know
enough.
We've
got
to
learn
before
we've
got
a
chance.
And
we've
got
to
live
and
keep
independent
while
we
learn.
See!
That's
what
has
to
be
done."
I
stared,
astonished,
and
stirred
profoundly
by
the
man's
resolution.
"Great
God!"
cried
I.
"But
you
are
a
man
indeed!"
And
suddenly
I
gripped
his
hand.
"Eh!"
he
said,
with
his
eyes
shining.
"I've
thought
it
out,
eh?"
"Go
on,"
I
said.
"Well,
those
who
mean
to
escape
their
catching
must
get
ready.
I'm
getting
ready.
Mind
you,
it
isn't
all
of
us
that
are
made
for
wild
beasts;
and
that's
what
it's
got
to
be.
That's
why
I
watched
you.
I
had
my
doubts.
You're
slender.
I
didn't
know
that
it
was
you,
you
see,
or
just
how
you'd
been
buried.
All
these--the
sort
of
people
that
lived
in
these
houses,
and
all
those
damn
little
clerks
that
used
to
live
down
that
way--they'd
be
no
good.
They
haven't
any
spirit
in
them--no
proud
dreams
and
no
proud
lusts;
and
a
man
who
hasn't
one
or
the
other--Lord!
What
is
he
but
funk
and
precautions?
They
just
used
to
skedaddle
off
to
work--I've
seen
hundreds
of
'em,
bit
of
breakfast
in
hand,
running
wild
and
shining
to
catch
their
little
season-ticket
train,
for
fear
they'd
get
dismissed
if
they
didn't;
working
at
businesses
they
were
afraid
to
take
the
trouble
to
understand;
skedaddling
back
for
fear
they
wouldn't
be
in
time
for
dinner;
keeping
indoors
after
dinner
for
fear
of
the
back
streets,
and
sleeping
with
the
wives
they
married,
not
because
they
wanted
them,
but
because
they
had
a
bit
of
money
that
would
make
for
safety
in
their
one
little
miserable
skedaddle
through
the
world.
Lives
insured
and
a
bit
invested
for
fear
of
accidents.
And
on
Sundays--fear
of
the
hereafter.
As
if
hell
was
built
for
rabbits!
Well,
the
Martians
will
just
be
a
godsend
to
these.
Nice
roomy
cages,
fattening
food,
careful
breeding,
no
worry.
After
a
week
or
so
chasing
about
the
fields
and
lands
on
empty
stomachs,
they'll
come
and
be
caught
cheerful.
They'll
be
quite
glad
after
a
bit.
They'll
wonder
what
people
did
before
there
were
Martians
to
take
care
of
them.
And
the
bar
loafers,
and
mashers,
and
singers--I
can
imagine
them.
I
can
imagine
them,"
he
said,
with
a
sort
of
sombre
gratification.
"There'll
be
any
amount
of
sentiment
and
religion
loose
among
them.
There's
hundreds
of
things
I
saw
with
my
eyes
that
I've
only
begun
to
see
clearly
these
last
few
days.
There's
lots
will
take
things
as
they
are--fat
and
stupid;
and
lots
will
be
worried
by
a
sort
of
feeling
that
it's
all
wrong,
and
that
they
ought
to
be
doing
something.
Now
whenever
things
are
so
that
a
lot
of
people
feel
they
ought
to
be
doing
something,
the
weak,
and
those
who
go
weak
with
a
lot
of
complicated
thinking,
always
make
for
a
sort
of
do-nothing
religion,
very
pious
and
superior,
and
submit
to
persecution
and
the
will
of
the
Lord.
Very
likely
you've
seen
the
same
thing.
It's
energy
in
a
gale
of
funk,
and
turned
clean
inside
out.
These
cages
will
be
full
of
psalms
and
hymns
and
piety.
And
those
of
a
less
simple
sort
will
work
in
a
bit
of--what
is
it?--eroticism."
He
paused.
"Very
likely
these
Martians
will
make
pets
of
some
of
them;
train
them
to
do
tricks--who
knows?--get
sentimental
over
the
pet
boy
who
grew
up
and
had
to
be
killed.
And
some,
maybe,
they
will
train
to
hunt
us."
"No,"
I
cried,
"that's
impossible!
No
human
being----"
"What's
the
good
of
going
on
with
such
lies?"
said
the
artilleryman.
"There's
men
who'd
do
it
cheerful.
What
nonsense
to
pretend
there
isn't!"
And
I
succumbed
to
his
conviction.
"If
they
come
after
me,"
he
said;
"Lord,
if
they
come
after
me!"
and
subsided
into
a
grim
meditation.
I
sat
contemplating
these
things.
I
could
find
nothing
to
bring
against
this
man's
reasoning.
In
the
days
before
the
invasion
no
one
would
have
questioned
my
intellectual
superiority
to
his--I,
a
professed
and
recognised
writer
on
philosophical
themes,
and
he,
a
common
soldier;
and
yet
he
had
already
formulated
a
situation
that
I
had
scarcely
realised.
"What
are
you
doing?"
I
said
presently.
"What
plans
have
you
made?"
He
hesitated.
"Well,
it's
like
this,"
he
said.
"What
have
we
to
do?
We
have
to
invent
a
sort
of
life
where
men
can
live
and
breed,
and
be
sufficiently
secure
to
bring
the
children
up.
Yes--wait
a
bit,
and
I'll
make
it
clearer
what
I
think
ought
to
be
done.
The
tame
ones
will
go
like
all
tame
beasts;
in
a
few
generations
they'll
be
big,
beautiful,
rich-blooded,
stupid--rubbish!
The
risk
is
that
we
who
keep
wild
will
go
savage--degenerate
into
a
sort
of
big,
savage
rat.
.
.
.
You
see,
how
I
mean
to
live
is
underground.
I've
been
thinking
about
the
drains.
Of
course
those
who
don't
know
drains
think
horrible
things;
but
under
this
London
are
miles
and
miles--hundreds
of
miles--and
a
few
days
rain
and
London
empty
will
leave
them
sweet
and
clean.
The
main
drains
are
big
enough
and
airy
enough
for
anyone.
Then
there's
cellars,
vaults,
stores,
from
which
bolting
passages
may
be
made
to
the
drains.
And
the
railway
tunnels
and
subways.
Eh?
You
begin
to
see?
And
we
form
a
band--able-bodied,
clean-minded
men.
We're
not
going
to
pick
up
any
rubbish
that
drifts
in.
Weaklings
go
out
again."
"As
you
meant
me
to
go?"
"Well--I
parleyed,
didn't
I?"
"We
won't
quarrel
about
that.
Go
on."
"Those
who
stop
obey
orders.
Able-bodied,
clean-minded
women
we
want
also--mothers
and
teachers.
No
lackadaisical
ladies--no
blasted
rolling
eyes.
We
can't
have
any
weak
or
silly.
Life
is
real
again,
and
the
useless
and
cumbersome
and
mischievous
have
to
die.
They
ought
to
die.
They
ought
to
be
willing
to
die.
It's
a
sort
of
disloyalty,
after
all,
to
live
and
taint
the
race.
And
they
can't
be
happy.
Moreover,
dying's
none
so
dreadful;
it's
the
funking
makes
it
bad.
And
in
all
those
places
we
shall
gather.
Our
district
will
be
London.
And
we
may
even
be
able
to
keep
a
watch,
and
run
about
in
the
open
when
the
Martians
keep
away.
Play
cricket,
perhaps.
That's
how
we
shall
save
the
race.
Eh?
It's
a
possible
thing?
But
saving
the
race
is
nothing
in
itself.
As
I
say,
that's
only
being
rats.
It's
saving
our
knowledge
and
adding
to
it
is
the
thing.
There
men
like
you
come
in.
There's
books,
there's
models.
We
must
make
great
safe
places
down
deep,
and
get
all
the
books
we
can;
not
novels
and
poetry
swipes,
but
ideas,
science
books.
That's
where
men
like
you
come
in.
We
must
go
to
the
British
Museum
and
pick
all
those
books
through.
Especially
we
must
keep
up
our
science--learn
more.
We
must
watch
these
Martians.
Some
of
us
must
go
as
spies.
When
it's
all
working,
perhaps
I
will.
Get
caught,
I
mean.
And
the
great
thing
is,
we
must
leave
the
Martians
alone.
We
mustn't
even
steal.
If
we
get
in
their
way,
we
clear
out.
We
must
show
them
we
mean
no
harm.
Yes,
I
know.
But
they're
intelligent
things,
and
they
won't
hunt
us
down
if
they
have
all
they
want,
and
think
we're
just
harmless
vermin."
The
artilleryman
paused
and
laid
a
brown
hand
upon
my
arm.
"After
all,
it
may
not
be
so
much
we
may
have
to
learn
before--Just
imagine
this:
four
or
five
of
their
fighting
machines
suddenly
starting
off--Heat-Rays
right
and
left,
and
not
a
Martian
in
'em.
Not
a
Martian
in
'em,
but
men--men
who
have
learned
the
way
how.
It
may
be
in
my
time,
even--those
men.
Fancy
having
one
of
them
lovely
things,
with
its
Heat-Ray
wide
and
free!
Fancy
having
it
in
control!
What
would
it
matter
if
you
smashed
to
smithereens
at
the
end
of
the
run,
after
a
bust
like
that?
I
reckon
the
Martians'll
open
their
beautiful
eyes!
Can't
you
see
them,
man?
Can't
you
see
them
hurrying,
hurrying--puffing
and
blowing
and
hooting
to
their
other
mechanical
affairs?
Something
out
of
gear
in
every
case.
And
swish,
bang,
rattle,
swish!
Just
as
they
are
fumbling
over
it,
_swish_
comes
the
Heat-Ray,
and,
behold!
man
has
come
back
to
his
own."
For
a
while
the
imaginative
daring
of
the
artilleryman,
and
the
tone
of
assurance
and
courage
he
assumed,
completely
dominated
my
mind.
I
believed
unhesitatingly
both
in
his
forecast
of
human
destiny
and
in
the
practicability
of
his
astonishing
scheme,
and
the
reader
who
thinks
me
susceptible
and
foolish
must
contrast
his
position,
reading
steadily
with
all
his
thoughts
about
his
subject,
and
mine,
crouching
fearfully
in
the
bushes
and
listening,
distracted
by
apprehension.
We
talked
in
this
manner
through
the
early
morning
time,
and
later
crept
out
of
the
bushes,
and,
after
scanning
the
sky
for
Martians,
hurried
precipitately
to
the
house
on
Putney
Hill
where
he
had
made
his
lair.
It
was
the
coal
cellar
of
the
place,
and
when
I
saw
the
work
he
had
spent
a
week
upon--it
was
a
burrow
scarcely
ten
yards
long,
which
he
designed
to
reach
to
the
main
drain
on
Putney
Hill--I
had
my
first
inkling
of
the
gulf
between
his
dreams
and
his
powers.
Such
a
hole
I
could
have
dug
in
a
day.
But
I
believed
in
him
sufficiently
to
work
with
him
all
that
morning
until
past
midday
at
his
digging.
We
had
a
garden
barrow
and
shot
the
earth
we
removed
against
the
kitchen
range.
We
refreshed
ourselves
with
a
tin
of
mock-turtle
soup
and
wine
from
the
neighbouring
pantry.
I
found
a
curious
relief
from
the
aching
strangeness
of
the
world
in
this
steady
labour.
As
we
worked,
I
turned
his
project
over
in
my
mind,
and
presently
objections
and
doubts
began
to
arise;
but
I
worked
there
all
the
morning,
so
glad
was
I
to
find
myself
with
a
purpose
again.
After
working
an
hour
I
began
to
speculate
on
the
distance
one
had
to
go
before
the
cloaca
was
reached,
the
chances
we
had
of
missing
it
altogether.
My
immediate
trouble
was
why
we
should
dig
this
long
tunnel,
when
it
was
possible
to
get
into
the
drain
at
once
down
one
of
the
manholes,
and
work
back
to
the
house.
It
seemed
to
me,
too,
that
the
house
was
inconveniently
chosen,
and
required
a
needless
length
of
tunnel.
And
just
as
I
was
beginning
to
face
these
things,
the
artilleryman
stopped
digging,
and
looked
at
me.
"We're
working
well,"
he
said.
He
put
down
his
spade.
"Let
us
knock
off
a
bit"
he
said.
"I
think
it's
time
we
reconnoitred
from
the
roof
of
the
house."
I
was
for
going
on,
and
after
a
little
hesitation
he
resumed
his
spade;
and
then
suddenly
I
was
struck
by
a
thought.
I
stopped,
and
so
did
he
at
once.
"Why
were
you
walking
about
the
common,"
I
said,
"instead
of
being
here?"
"Taking
the
air,"
he
said.
"I
was
coming
back.
It's
safer
by
night."
"But
the
work?"
"Oh,
one
can't
always
work,"
he
said,
and
in
a
flash
I
saw
the
man
plain.
He
hesitated,
holding
his
spade.
"We
ought
to
reconnoitre
now,"
he
said,
"because
if
any
come
near
they
may
hear
the
spades
and
drop
upon
us
unawares."
I
was
no
longer
disposed
to
object.
We
went
together
to
the
roof
and
stood
on
a
ladder
peeping
out
of
the
roof
door.
No
Martians
were
to
be
seen,
and
we
ventured
out
on
the
tiles,
and
slipped
down
under
shelter
of
the
parapet.
From
this
position
a
shrubbery
hid
the
greater
portion
of
Putney,
but
we
could
see
the
river
below,
a
bubbly
mass
of
red
weed,
and
the
low
parts
of
Lambeth
flooded
and
red.
The
red
creeper
swarmed
up
the
trees
about
the
old
palace,
and
their
branches
stretched
gaunt
and
dead,
and
set
with
shrivelled
leaves,
from
amid
its
clusters.
It
was
strange
how
entirely
dependent
both
these
things
were
upon
flowing
water
for
their
propagation.
About
us
neither
had
gained
a
footing;
laburnums,
pink
mays,
snowballs,
and
trees
of
arbor-vitae,
rose
out
of
laurels
and
hydrangeas,
green
and
brilliant
into
the
sunlight.
Beyond
Kensington
dense
smoke
was
rising,
and
that
and
a
blue
haze
hid
the
northward
hills.
The
artilleryman
began
to
tell
me
of
the
sort
of
people
who
still
remained
in
London.
"One
night
last
week,"
he
said,
"some
fools
got
the
electric
light
in
order,
and
there
was
all
Regent
Street
and
the
Circus
ablaze,
crowded
with
painted
and
ragged
drunkards,
men
and
women,
dancing
and
shouting
till
dawn.
A
man
who
was
there
told
me.
And
as
the
day
came
they
became
aware
of
a
fighting-machine
standing
near
by
the
Langham
and
looking
down
at
them.
Heaven
knows
how
long
he
had
been
there.
It
must
have
given
some
of
them
a
nasty
turn.
He
came
down
the
road
towards
them,
and
picked
up
nearly
a
hundred
too
drunk
or
frightened
to
run
away."
Grotesque
gleam
of
a
time
no
history
will
ever
fully
describe!
From
that,
in
answer
to
my
questions,
he
came
round
to
his
grandiose
plans
again.
He
grew
enthusiastic.
He
talked
so
eloquently
of
the
possibility
of
capturing
a
fighting-machine
that
I
more
than
half
believed
in
him
again.
But
now
that
I
was
beginning
to
understand
something
of
his
quality,
I
could
divine
the
stress
he
laid
on
doing
nothing
precipitately.
And
I
noted
that
now
there
was
no
question
that
he
personally
was
to
capture
and
fight
the
great
machine.
After
a
time
we
went
down
to
the
cellar.
Neither
of
us
seemed
disposed
to
resume
digging,
and
when
he
suggested
a
meal,
I
was
nothing
loath.
He
became
suddenly
very
generous,
and
when
we
had
eaten
he
went
away
and
returned
with
some
excellent
cigars.
We
lit
these,
and
his
optimism
glowed.
He
was
inclined
to
regard
my
coming
as
a
great
occasion.
"There's
some
champagne
in
the
cellar,"
he
said.
"We
can
dig
better
on
this
Thames-side
burgundy,"
said
I.
"No,"
said
he;
"I
am
host
today.
Champagne!
Great
God!
We've
a
heavy
enough
task
before
us!
Let
us
take
a
rest
and
gather
strength
while
we
may.
Look
at
these
blistered
hands!"
And
pursuant
to
this
idea
of
a
holiday,
he
insisted
upon
playing
cards
after
we
had
eaten.
He
taught
me
euchre,
and
after
dividing
London
between
us,
I
taking
the
northern
side
and
he
the
southern,
we
played
for
parish
points.
Grotesque
and
foolish
as
this
will
seem
to
the
sober
reader,
it
is
absolutely
true,
and
what
is
more
remarkable,
I
found
the
card
game
and
several
others
we
played
extremely
interesting.
Strange
mind
of
man!
that,
with
our
species
upon
the
edge
of
extermination
or
appalling
degradation,
with
no
clear
prospect
before
us
but
the
chance
of
a
horrible
death,
we
could
sit
following
the
chance
of
this
painted
pasteboard,
and
playing
the
"joker"
with
vivid
delight.
Afterwards
he
taught
me
poker,
and
I
beat
him
at
three
tough
chess
games.
When
dark
came
we
decided
to
take
the
risk,
and
lit
a
lamp.
After
an
interminable
string
of
games,
we
supped,
and
the
artilleryman
finished
the
champagne.
We
went
on
smoking
the
cigars.
He
was
no
longer
the
energetic
regenerator
of
his
species
I
had
encountered
in
the
morning.
He
was
still
optimistic,
but
it
was
a
less
kinetic,
a
more
thoughtful
optimism.
I
remember
he
wound
up
with
my
health,
proposed
in
a
speech
of
small
variety
and
considerable
intermittence.
I
took
a
cigar,
and
went
upstairs
to
look
at
the
lights
of
which
he
had
spoken
that
blazed
so
greenly
along
the
Highgate
hills.
At
first
I
stared
unintelligently
across
the
London
valley.
The
northern
hills
were
shrouded
in
darkness;
the
fires
near
Kensington
glowed
redly,
and
now
and
then
an
orange-red
tongue
of
flame
flashed
up
and
vanished
in
the
deep
blue
night.
All
the
rest
of
London
was
black.
Then,
nearer,
I
perceived
a
strange
light,
a
pale,
violet-purple
fluorescent
glow,
quivering
under
the
night
breeze.
For
a
space
I
could
not
understand
it,
and
then
I
knew
that
it
must
be
the
red
weed
from
which
this
faint
irradiation
proceeded.
With
that
realisation
my
dormant
sense
of
wonder,
my
sense
of
the
proportion
of
things,
awoke
again.
I
glanced
from
that
to
Mars,
red
and
clear,
glowing
high
in
the
west,
and
then
gazed
long
and
earnestly
at
the
darkness
of
Hampstead
and
Highgate.
I
remained
a
very
long
time
upon
the
roof,
wondering
at
the
grotesque
changes
of
the
day.
I
recalled
my
mental
states
from
the
midnight
prayer
to
the
foolish
card-playing.
I
had
a
violent
revulsion
of
feeling.
I
remember
I
flung
away
the
cigar
with
a
certain
wasteful
symbolism.
My
folly
came
to
me
with
glaring
exaggeration.
I
seemed
a
traitor
to
my
wife
and
to
my
kind;
I
was
filled
with
remorse.
I
resolved
to
leave
this
strange
undisciplined
dreamer
of
great
things
to
his
drink
and
gluttony,
and
to
go
on
into
London.
There,
it
seemed
to
me,
I
had
the
best
chance
of
learning
what
the
Martians
and
my
fellowmen
were
doing.
I
was
still
upon
the
roof
when
the
late
moon
rose.
CHAPTER
EIGHT
DEAD
LONDON
After
I
had
parted
from
the
artilleryman,
I
went
down
the
hill,
and
by
the
High
Street
across
the
bridge
to
Fulham.
The
red
weed
was
tumultuous
at
that
time,
and
nearly
choked
the
bridge
roadway;
but
its
fronds
were
already
whitened
in
patches
by
the
spreading
disease
that
presently
removed
it
so
swiftly.
At
the
corner
of
the
lane
that
runs
to
Putney
Bridge
station
I
found
a
man
lying.
He
was
as
black
as
a
sweep
with
the
black
dust,
alive,
but
helplessly
and
speechlessly
drunk.
I
could
get
nothing
from
him
but
curses
and
furious
lunges
at
my
head.
I
think
I
should
have
stayed
by
him
but
for
the
brutal
expression
of
his
face.
There
was
black
dust
along
the
roadway
from
the
bridge
onwards,
and
it
grew
thicker
in
Fulham.
The
streets
were
horribly
quiet.
I
got
food--sour,
hard,
and
mouldy,
but
quite
eatable--in
a
baker's
shop
here.
Some
way
towards
Walham
Green
the
streets
became
clear
of
powder,
and
I
passed
a
white
terrace
of
houses
on
fire;
the
noise
of
the
burning
was
an
absolute
relief.
Going
on
towards
Brompton,
the
streets
were
quiet
again.
Here
I
came
once
more
upon
the
black
powder
in
the
streets
and
upon
dead
bodies.
I
saw
altogether
about
a
dozen
in
the
length
of
the
Fulham
Road.
They
had
been
dead
many
days,
so
that
I
hurried
quickly
past
them.
The
black
powder
covered
them
over,
and
softened
their
outlines.
One
or
two
had
been
disturbed
by
dogs.
Where
there
was
no
black
powder,
it
was
curiously
like
a
Sunday
in
the
City,
with
the
closed
shops,
the
houses
locked
up
and
the
blinds
drawn,
the
desertion,
and
the
stillness.
In
some
places
plunderers
had
been
at
work,
but
rarely
at
other
than
the
provision
and
wine
shops.
A
jeweller's
window
had
been
broken
open
in
one
place,
but
apparently
the
thief
had
been
disturbed,
and
a
number
of
gold
chains
and
a
watch
lay
scattered
on
the
pavement.
I
did
not
trouble
to
touch
them.
Farther
on
was
a
tattered
woman
in
a
heap
on
a
doorstep;
the
hand
that
hung
over
her
knee
was
gashed
and
bled
down
her
rusty
brown
dress,
and
a
smashed
magnum
of
champagne
formed
a
pool
across
the
pavement.
She
seemed
asleep,
but
she
was
dead.
The
farther
I
penetrated
into
London,
the
profounder
grew
the
stillness.
But
it
was
not
so
much
the
stillness
of
death--it
was
the
stillness
of
suspense,
of
expectation.
At
any
time
the
destruction
that
had
already
singed
the
northwestern
borders
of
the
metropolis,
and
had
annihilated
Ealing
and
Kilburn,
might
strike
among
these
houses
and
leave
them
smoking
ruins.
It
was
a
city
condemned
and
derelict.
.
.
.
In
South
Kensington
the
streets
were
clear
of
dead
and
of
black
powder.
It
was
near
South
Kensington
that
I
first
heard
the
howling.
It
crept
almost
imperceptibly
upon
my
senses.
It
was
a
sobbing
alternation
of
two
notes,
"Ulla,
ulla,
ulla,
ulla,"
keeping
on
perpetually.
When
I
passed
streets
that
ran
northward
it
grew
in
volume,
and
houses
and
buildings
seemed
to
deaden
and
cut
it
off
again.
It
came
in
a
full
tide
down
Exhibition
Road.
I
stopped,
staring
towards
Kensington
Gardens,
wondering
at
this
strange,
remote
wailing.
It
was
as
if
that
mighty
desert
of
houses
had
found
a
voice
for
its
fear
and
solitude.
"Ulla,
ulla,
ulla,
ulla,"
wailed
that
superhuman
note--great
waves
of
sound
sweeping
down
the
broad,
sunlit
roadway,
between
the
tall
buildings
on
each
side.
I
turned
northwards,
marvelling,
towards
the
iron
gates
of
Hyde
Park.
I
had
half
a
mind
to
break
into
the
Natural
History
Museum
and
find
my
way
up
to
the
summits
of
the
towers,
in
order
to
see
across
the
park.
But
I
decided
to
keep
to
the
ground,
where
quick
hiding
was
possible,
and
so
went
on
up
the
Exhibition
Road.
All
the
large
mansions
on
each
side
of
the
road
were
empty
and
still,
and
my
footsteps
echoed
against
the
sides
of
the
houses.
At
the
top,
near
the
park
gate,
I
came
upon
a
strange
sight--a
bus
overturned,
and
the
skeleton
of
a
horse
picked
clean.
I
puzzled
over
this
for
a
time,
and
then
went
on
to
the
bridge
over
the
Serpentine.
The
voice
grew
stronger
and
stronger,
though
I
could
see
nothing
above
the
housetops
on
the
north
side
of
the
park,
save
a
haze
of
smoke
to
the
northwest.
"Ulla,
ulla,
ulla,
ulla,"
cried
the
voice,
coming,
as
it
seemed
to
me,
from
the
district
about
Regent's
Park.
The
desolating
cry
worked
upon
my
mind.
The
mood
that
had
sustained
me
passed.
The
wailing
took
possession
of
me.
I
found
I
was
intensely
weary,
footsore,
and
now
again
hungry
and
thirsty.
It
was
already
past
noon.
Why
was
I
wandering
alone
in
this
city
of
the
dead?
Why
was
I
alone
when
all
London
was
lying
in
state,
and
in
its
black
shroud?
I
felt
intolerably
lonely.
My
mind
ran
on
old
friends
that
I
had
forgotten
for
years.
I
thought
of
the
poisons
in
the
chemists'
shops,
of
the
liquors
the
wine
merchants
stored;
I
recalled
the
two
sodden
creatures
of
despair,
who
so
far
as
I
knew,
shared
the
city
with
myself.
.
.
.
I
came
into
Oxford
Street
by
the
Marble
Arch,
and
here
again
were
black
powder
and
several
bodies,
and
an
evil,
ominous
smell
from
the
gratings
of
the
cellars
of
some
of
the
houses.
I
grew
very
thirsty
after
the
heat
of
my
long
walk.
With
infinite
trouble
I
managed
to
break
into
a
public-house
and
get
food
and
drink.
I
was
weary
after
eating,
and
went
into
the
parlour
behind
the
bar,
and
slept
on
a
black
horsehair
sofa
I
found
there.
I
awoke
to
find
that
dismal
howling
still
in
my
ears,
"Ulla,
ulla,
ulla,
ulla."
It
was
now
dusk,
and
after
I
had
routed
out
some
biscuits
and
a
cheese
in
the
bar--there
was
a
meat
safe,
but
it
contained
nothing
but
maggots--I
wandered
on
through
the
silent
residential
squares
to
Baker
Street--Portman
Square
is
the
only
one
I
can
name--and
so
came
out
at
last
upon
Regent's
Park.
And
as
I
emerged
from
the
top
of
Baker
Street,
I
saw
far
away
over
the
trees
in
the
clearness
of
the
sunset
the
hood
of
the
Martian
giant
from
which
this
howling
proceeded.
I
was
not
terrified.
I
came
upon
him
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
course.
I
watched
him
for
some
time,
but
he
did
not
move.
He
appeared
to
be
standing
and
yelling,
for
no
reason
that
I
could
discover.
I
tried
to
formulate
a
plan
of
action.
That
perpetual
sound
of
"Ulla,
ulla,
ulla,
ulla,"
confused
my
mind.
Perhaps
I
was
too
tired
to
be
very
fearful.
Certainly
I
was
more
curious
to
know
the
reason
of
this
monotonous
crying
than
afraid.
I
turned
back
away
from
the
park
and
struck
into
Park
Road,
intending
to
skirt
the
park,
went
along
under
the
shelter
of
the
terraces,
and
got
a
view
of
this
stationary,
howling
Martian
from
the
direction
of
St.
John's
Wood.
A
couple
of
hundred
yards
out
of
Baker
Street
I
heard
a
yelping
chorus,
and
saw,
first
a
dog
with
a
piece
of
putrescent
red
meat
in
his
jaws
coming
headlong
towards
me,
and
then
a
pack
of
starving
mongrels
in
pursuit
of
him.
He
made
a
wide
curve
to
avoid
me,
as
though
he
feared
I
might
prove
a
fresh
competitor.
As
the
yelping
died
away
down
the
silent
road,
the
wailing
sound
of
"Ulla,
ulla,
ulla,
ulla,"
reasserted
itself.
I
came
upon
the
wrecked
handling-machine
halfway
to
St.
John's
Wood
station.
At
first
I
thought
a
house
had
fallen
across
the
road.
It
was
only
as
I
clambered
among
the
ruins
that
I
saw,
with
a
start,
this
mechanical
Samson
lying,
with
its
tentacles
bent
and
smashed
and
twisted,
among
the
ruins
it
had
made.
The
forepart
was
shattered.
It
seemed
as
if
it
had
driven
blindly
straight
at
the
house,
and
had
been
overwhelmed
in
its
overthrow.
It
seemed
to
me
then
that
this
might
have
happened
by
a
handling-machine
escaping
from
the
guidance
of
its
Martian.
I
could
not
clamber
among
the
ruins
to
see
it,
and
the
twilight
was
now
so
far
advanced
that
the
blood
with
which
its
seat
was
smeared,
and
the
gnawed
gristle
of
the
Martian
that
the
dogs
had
left,
were
invisible
to
me.
Wondering
still
more
at
all
that
I
had
seen,
I
pushed
on
towards
Primrose
Hill.
Far
away,
through
a
gap
in
the
trees,
I
saw
a
second
Martian,
as
motionless
as
the
first,
standing
in
the
park
towards
the
Zoological
Gardens,
and
silent.
A
little
beyond
the
ruins
about
the
smashed
handling-machine
I
came
upon
the
red
weed
again,
and
found
the
Regent's
Canal,
a
spongy
mass
of
dark-red
vegetation.
As
I
crossed
the
bridge,
the
sound
of
"Ulla,
ulla,
ulla,
ulla,"
ceased.
It
was,
as
it
were,
cut
off.
The
silence
came
like
a
thunderclap.
The
dusky
houses
about
me
stood
faint
and
tall
and
dim;
the
trees
towards
the
park
were
growing
black.
All
about
me
the
red
weed
clambered
among
the
ruins,
writhing
to
get
above
me
in
the
dimness.
Night,
the
mother
of
fear
and
mystery,
was
coming
upon
me.
But
while
that
voice
sounded
the
solitude,
the
desolation,
had
been
endurable;
by
virtue
of
it
London
had
still
seemed
alive,
and
the
sense
of
life
about
me
had
upheld
me.
Then
suddenly
a
change,
the
passing
of
something--I
knew
not
what--and
then
a
stillness
that
could
be
felt.
Nothing
but
this
gaunt
quiet.
London
about
me
gazed
at
me
spectrally.
The
windows
in
the
white
houses
were
like
the
eye
sockets
of
skulls.
About
me
my
imagination
found
a
thousand
noiseless
enemies
moving.
Terror
seized
me,
a
horror
of
my
temerity.
In
front
of
me
the
road
became
pitchy
black
as
though
it
was
tarred,
and
I
saw
a
contorted
shape
lying
across
the
pathway.
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
go
on.
I
turned
down
St.
John's
Wood
Road,
and
ran
headlong
from
this
unendurable
stillness
towards
Kilburn.
I
hid
from
the
night
and
the
silence,
until
long
after
midnight,
in
a
cabmen's
shelter
in
Harrow
Road.
But
before
the
dawn
my
courage
returned,
and
while
the
stars
were
still
in
the
sky
I
turned
once
more
towards
Regent's
Park.
I
missed
my
way
among
the
streets,
and
presently
saw
down
a
long
avenue,
in
the
half-light
of
the
early
dawn,
the
curve
of
Primrose
Hill.
On
the
summit,
towering
up
to
the
fading
stars,
was
a
third
Martian,
erect
and
motionless
like
the
others.
An
insane
resolve
possessed
me.
I
would
die
and
end
it.
And
I
would
save
myself
even
the
trouble
of
killing
myself.
I
marched
on
recklessly
towards
this
Titan,
and
then,
as
I
drew
nearer
and
the
light
grew,
I
saw
that
a
multitude
of
black
birds
was
circling
and
clustering
about
the
hood.
At
that
my
heart
gave
a
bound,
and
I
began
running
along
the
road.
I
hurried
through
the
red
weed
that
choked
St.
Edmund's
Terrace
(I
waded
breast-high
across
a
torrent
of
water
that
was
rushing
down
from
the
waterworks
towards
the
Albert
Road),
and
emerged
upon
the
grass
before
the
rising
of
the
sun.
Great
mounds
had
been
heaped
about
the
crest
of
the
hill,
making
a
huge
redoubt
of
it--it
was
the
final
and
largest
place
the
Martians
had
made--and
from
behind
these
heaps
there
rose
a
thin
smoke
against
the
sky.
Against
the
sky
line
an
eager
dog
ran
and
disappeared.
The
thought
that
had
flashed
into
my
mind
grew
real,
grew
credible.
I
felt
no
fear,
only
a
wild,
trembling
exultation,
as
I
ran
up
the
hill
towards
the
motionless
monster.
Out
of
the
hood
hung
lank
shreds
of
brown,
at
which
the
hungry
birds
pecked
and
tore.
In
another
moment
I
had
scrambled
up
the
earthen
rampart
and
stood
upon
its
crest,
and
the
interior
of
the
redoubt
was
below
me.
A
mighty
space
it
was,
with
gigantic
machines
here
and
there
within
it,
huge
mounds
of
material
and
strange
shelter
places.
And
scattered
about
it,
some
in
their
overturned
war-machines,
some
in
the
now
rigid
handling-machines,
and
a
dozen
of
them
stark
and
silent
and
laid
in
a
row,
were
the
Martians--_dead_!--slain
by
the
putrefactive
and
disease
bacteria
against
which
their
systems
were
unprepared;
slain
as
the
red
weed
was
being
slain;
slain,
after
all
man's
devices
had
failed,
by
the
humblest
things
that
God,
in
his
wisdom,
has
put
upon
this
earth.
For
so
it
had
come
about,
as
indeed
I
and
many
men
might
have
foreseen
had
not
terror
and
disaster
blinded
our
minds.
These
germs
of
disease
have
taken
toll
of
humanity
since
the
beginning
of
things--taken
toll
of
our
prehuman
ancestors
since
life
began
here.
But
by
virtue
of
this
natural
selection
of
our
kind
we
have
developed
resisting
power;
to
no
germs
do
we
succumb
without
a
struggle,
and
to
many--those
that
cause
putrefaction
in
dead
matter,
for
instance--our
living
frames
are
altogether
immune.
But
there
are
no
bacteria
in
Mars,
and
directly
these
invaders
arrived,
directly
they
drank
and
fed,
our
microscopic
allies
began
to
work
their
overthrow.
Already
when
I
watched
them
they
were
irrevocably
doomed,
dying
and
rotting
even
as
they
went
to
and
fro.
It
was
inevitable.
By
the
toll
of
a
billion
deaths
man
has
bought
his
birthright
of
the
earth,
and
it
is
his
against
all
comers;
it
would
still
be
his
were
the
Martians
ten
times
as
mighty
as
they
are.
For
neither
do
men
live
nor
die
in
vain.
Here
and
there
they
were
scattered,
nearly
fifty
altogether,
in
that
great
gulf
they
had
made,
overtaken
by
a
death
that
must
have
seemed
to
them
as
incomprehensible
as
any
death
could
be.
To
me
also
at
that
time
this
death
was
incomprehensible.
All
I
knew
was
that
these
things
that
had
been
alive
and
so
terrible
to
men
were
dead.
For
a
moment
I
believed
that
the
destruction
of
Sennacherib
had
been
repeated,
that
God
had
repented,
that
the
Angel
of
Death
had
slain
them
in
the
night.
I
stood
staring
into
the
pit,
and
my
heart
lightened
gloriously,
even
as
the
rising
sun
struck
the
world
to
fire
about
me
with
his
rays.
The
pit
was
still
in
darkness;
the
mighty
engines,
so
great
and
wonderful
in
their
power
and
complexity,
so
unearthly
in
their
tortuous
forms,
rose
weird
and
vague
and
strange
out
of
the
shadows
towards
the
light.
A
multitude
of
dogs,
I
could
hear,
fought
over
the
bodies
that
lay
darkly
in
the
depth
of
the
pit,
far
below
me.
Across
the
pit
on
its
farther
lip,
flat
and
vast
and
strange,
lay
the
great
flying-machine
with
which
they
had
been
experimenting
upon
our
denser
atmosphere
when
decay
and
death
arrested
them.
Death
had
come
not
a
day
too
soon.
At
the
sound
of
a
cawing
overhead
I
looked
up
at
the
huge
fighting-machine
that
would
fight
no
more
for
ever,
at
the
tattered
red
shreds
of
flesh
that
dripped
down
upon
the
overturned
seats
on
the
summit
of
Primrose
Hill.
I
turned
and
looked
down
the
slope
of
the
hill
to
where,
enhaloed
now
in
birds,
stood
those
other
two
Martians
that
I
had
seen
overnight,
just
as
death
had
overtaken
them.
The
one
had
died,
even
as
it
had
been
crying
to
its
companions;
perhaps
it
was
the
last
to
die,
and
its
voice
had
gone
on
perpetually
until
the
force
of
its
machinery
was
exhausted.
They
glittered
now,
harmless
tripod
towers
of
shining
metal,
in
the
brightness
of
the
rising
sun.
All
about
the
pit,
and
saved
as
by
a
miracle
from
everlasting
destruction,
stretched
the
great
Mother
of
Cities.
Those
who
have
only
seen
London
veiled
in
her
sombre
robes
of
smoke
can
scarcely
imagine
the
naked
clearness
and
beauty
of
the
silent
wilderness
of
houses.
Eastward,
over
the
blackened
ruins
of
the
Albert
Terrace
and
the
splintered
spire
of
the
church,
the
sun
blazed
dazzling
in
a
clear
sky,
and
here
and
there
some
facet
in
the
great
wilderness
of
roofs
caught
the
light
and
glared
with
a
white
intensity.
Northward
were
Kilburn
and
Hampsted,
blue
and
crowded
with
houses;
westward
the
great
city
was
dimmed;
and
southward,
beyond
the
Martians,
the
green
waves
of
Regent's
Park,
the
Langham
Hotel,
the
dome
of
the
Albert
Hall,
the
Imperial
Institute,
and
the
giant
mansions
of
the
Brompton
Road
came
out
clear
and
little
in
the
sunrise,
the
jagged
ruins
of
Westminster
rising
hazily
beyond.
Far
away
and
blue
were
the
Surrey
hills,
and
the
towers
of
the
Crystal
Palace
glittered
like
two
silver
rods.
The
dome
of
St.
Paul's
was
dark
against
the
sunrise,
and
injured,
I
saw
for
the
first
time,
by
a
huge
gaping
cavity
on
its
western
side.
And
as
I
looked
at
this
wide
expanse
of
houses
and
factories
and
churches,
silent
and
abandoned;
as
I
thought
of
the
multitudinous
hopes
and
efforts,
the
innumerable
hosts
of
lives
that
had
gone
to
build
this
human
reef,
and
of
the
swift
and
ruthless
destruction
that
had
hung
over
it
all;
when
I
realised
that
the
shadow
had
been
rolled
back,
and
that
men
might
still
live
in
the
streets,
and
this
dear
vast
dead
city
of
mine
be
once
more
alive
and
powerful,
I
felt
a
wave
of
emotion
that
was
near
akin
to
tears.
The
torment
was
over.
Even
that
day
the
healing
would
begin.
The
survivors
of
the
people
scattered
over
the
country--leaderless,
lawless,
foodless,
like
sheep
without
a
shepherd--the
thousands
who
had
fled
by
sea,
would
begin
to
return;
the
pulse
of
life,
growing
stronger
and
stronger,
would
beat
again
in
the
empty
streets
and
pour
across
the
vacant
squares.
Whatever
destruction
was
done,
the
hand
of
the
destroyer
was
stayed.
All
the
gaunt
wrecks,
the
blackened
skeletons
of
houses
that
stared
so
dismally
at
the
sunlit
grass
of
the
hill,
would
presently
be
echoing
with
the
hammers
of
the
restorers
and
ringing
with
the
tapping
of
their
trowels.
At
the
thought
I
extended
my
hands
towards
the
sky
and
began
thanking
God.
In
a
year,
thought
I--in
a
year.
.
.
With
overwhelming
force
came
the
thought
of
myself,
of
my
wife,
and
the
old
life
of
hope
and
tender
helpfulness
that
had
ceased
for
ever.
CHAPTER
NINE
WRECKAGE
And
now
comes
the
strangest
thing
in
my
story.
Yet,
perhaps,
it
is
not
altogether
strange.
I
remember,
clearly
and
coldly
and
vividly,
all
that
I
did
that
day
until
the
time
that
I
stood
weeping
and
praising
God
upon
the
summit
of
Primrose
Hill.
And
then
I
forget.
Of
the
next
three
days
I
know
nothing.
I
have
learned
since
that,
so
far
from
my
being
the
first
discoverer
of
the
Martian
overthrow,
several
such
wanderers
as
myself
had
already
discovered
this
on
the
previous
night.
One
man--the
first--had
gone
to
St.
Martin's-le-Grand,
and,
while
I
sheltered
in
the
cabmen's
hut,
had
contrived
to
telegraph
to
Paris.
Thence
the
joyful
news
had
flashed
all
over
the
world;
a
thousand
cities,
chilled
by
ghastly
apprehensions,
suddenly
flashed
into
frantic
illuminations;
they
knew
of
it
in
Dublin,
Edinburgh,
Manchester,
Birmingham,
at
the
time
when
I
stood
upon
the
verge
of
the
pit.
Already
men,
weeping
with
joy,
as
I
have
heard,
shouting
and
staying
their
work
to
shake
hands
and
shout,
were
making
up
trains,
even
as
near
as
Crewe,
to
descend
upon
London.
The
church
bells
that
had
ceased
a
fortnight
since
suddenly
caught
the
news,
until
all
England
was
bell-ringing.
Men
on
cycles,
lean-faced,
unkempt,
scorched
along
every
country
lane
shouting
of
unhoped
deliverance,
shouting
to
gaunt,
staring
figures
of
despair.
And
for
the
food!
Across
the
Channel,
across
the
Irish
Sea,
across
the
Atlantic,
corn,
bread,
and
meat
were
tearing
to
our
relief.
All
the
shipping
in
the
world
seemed
going
Londonward
in
those
days.
But
of
all
this
I
have
no
memory.
I
drifted--a
demented
man.
I
found
myself
in
a
house
of
kindly
people,
who
had
found
me
on
the
third
day
wandering,
weeping,
and
raving
through
the
streets
of
St.
John's
Wood.
They
have
told
me
since
that
I
was
singing
some
insane
doggerel
about
"The
Last
Man
Left
Alive!
Hurrah!
The
Last
Man
Left
Alive!"
Troubled
as
they
were
with
their
own
affairs,
these
people,
whose
name,
much
as
I
would
like
to
express
my
gratitude
to
them,
I
may
not
even
give
here,
nevertheless
cumbered
themselves
with
me,
sheltered
me,
and
protected
me
from
myself.
Apparently
they
had
learned
something
of
my
story
from
me
during
the
days
of
my
lapse.
Very
gently,
when
my
mind
was
assured
again,
did
they
break
to
me
what
they
had
learned
of
the
fate
of
Leatherhead.
Two
days
after
I
was
imprisoned
it
had
been
destroyed,
with
every
soul
in
it,
by
a
Martian.
He
had
swept
it
out
of
existence,
as
it
seemed,
without
any
provocation,
as
a
boy
might
crush
an
ant
hill,
in
the
mere
wantonness
of
power.
I
was
a
lonely
man,
and
they
were
very
kind
to
me.
I
was
a
lonely
man
and
a
sad
one,
and
they
bore
with
me.
I
remained
with
them
four
days
after
my
recovery.
All
that
time
I
felt
a
vague,
a
growing
craving
to
look
once
more
on
whatever
remained
of
the
little
life
that
seemed
so
happy
and
bright
in
my
past.
It
was
a
mere
hopeless
desire
to
feast
upon
my
misery.
They
dissuaded
me.
They
did
all
they
could
to
divert
me
from
this
morbidity.
But
at
last
I
could
resist
the
impulse
no
longer,
and,
promising
faithfully
to
return
to
them,
and
parting,
as
I
will
confess,
from
these
four-day
friends
with
tears,
I
went
out
again
into
the
streets
that
had
lately
been
so
dark
and
strange
and
empty.
Already
they
were
busy
with
returning
people;
in
places
even
there
were
shops
open,
and
I
saw
a
drinking
fountain
running
water.
I
remember
how
mockingly
bright
the
day
seemed
as
I
went
back
on
my
melancholy
pilgrimage
to
the
little
house
at
Woking,
how
busy
the
streets
and
vivid
the
moving
life
about
me.
So
many
people
were
abroad
everywhere,
busied
in
a
thousand
activities,
that
it
seemed
incredible
that
any
great
proportion
of
the
population
could
have
been
slain.
But
then
I
noticed
how
yellow
were
the
skins
of
the
people
I
met,
how
shaggy
the
hair
of
the
men,
how
large
and
bright
their
eyes,
and
that
every
other
man
still
wore
his
dirty
rags.
Their
faces
seemed
all
with
one
of
two
expressions--a
leaping
exultation
and
energy
or
a
grim
resolution.
Save
for
the
expression
of
the
faces,
London
seemed
a
city
of
tramps.
The
vestries
were
indiscriminately
distributing
bread
sent
us
by
the
French
government.
The
ribs
of
the
few
horses
showed
dismally.
Haggard
special
constables
with
white
badges
stood
at
the
corners
of
every
street.
I
saw
little
of
the
mischief
wrought
by
the
Martians
until
I
reached
Wellington
Street,
and
there
I
saw
the
red
weed
clambering
over
the
buttresses
of
Waterloo
Bridge.
At
the
corner
of
the
bridge,
too,
I
saw
one
of
the
common
contrasts
of
that
grotesque
time--a
sheet
of
paper
flaunting
against
a
thicket
of
the
red
weed,
transfixed
by
a
stick
that
kept
it
in
place.
It
was
the
placard
of
the
first
newspaper
to
resume
publication--the
_Daily
Mail_.
I
bought
a
copy
for
a
blackened
shilling
I
found
in
my
pocket.
Most
of
it
was
in
blank,
but
the
solitary
compositor
who
did
the
thing
had
amused
himself
by
making
a
grotesque
scheme
of
advertisement
stereo
on
the
back
page.
The
matter
he
printed
was
emotional;
the
news
organisation
had
not
as
yet
found
its
way
back.
I
learned
nothing
fresh
except
that
already
in
one
week
the
examination
of
the
Martian
mechanisms
had
yielded
astonishing
results.
Among
other
things,
the
article
assured
me
what
I
did
not
believe
at
the
time,
that
the
"Secret
of
Flying,"
was
discovered.
At
Waterloo
I
found
the
free
trains
that
were
taking
people
to
their
homes.
The
first
rush
was
already
over.
There
were
few
people
in
the
train,
and
I
was
in
no
mood
for
casual
conversation.
I
got
a
compartment
to
myself,
and
sat
with
folded
arms,
looking
greyly
at
the
sunlit
devastation
that
flowed
past
the
windows.
And
just
outside
the
terminus
the
train
jolted
over
temporary
rails,
and
on
either
side
of
the
railway
the
houses
were
blackened
ruins.
To
Clapham
Junction
the
face
of
London
was
grimy
with
powder
of
the
Black
Smoke,
in
spite
of
two
days
of
thunderstorms
and
rain,
and
at
Clapham
Junction
the
line
had
been
wrecked
again;
there
were
hundreds
of
out-of-work
clerks
and
shopmen
working
side
by
side
with
the
customary
navvies,
and
we
were
jolted
over
a
hasty
relaying.
All
down
the
line
from
there
the
aspect
of
the
country
was
gaunt
and
unfamiliar;
Wimbledon
particularly
had
suffered.
Walton,
by
virtue
of
its
unburned
pine
woods,
seemed
the
least
hurt
of
any
place
along
the
line.
The
Wandle,
the
Mole,
every
little
stream,
was
a
heaped
mass
of
red
weed,
in
appearance
between
butcher's
meat
and
pickled
cabbage.
The
Surrey
pine
woods
were
too
dry,
however,
for
the
festoons
of
the
red
climber.
Beyond
Wimbledon,
within
sight
of
the
line,
in
certain
nursery
grounds,
were
the
heaped
masses
of
earth
about
the
sixth
cylinder.
A
number
of
people
were
standing
about
it,
and
some
sappers
were
busy
in
the
midst
of
it.
Over
it
flaunted
a
Union
Jack,
flapping
cheerfully
in
the
morning
breeze.
The
nursery
grounds
were
everywhere
crimson
with
the
weed,
a
wide
expanse
of
livid
colour
cut
with
purple
shadows,
and
very
painful
to
the
eye.
One's
gaze
went
with
infinite
relief
from
the
scorched
greys
and
sullen
reds
of
the
foreground
to
the
blue-green
softness
of
the
eastward
hills.
The
line
on
the
London
side
of
Woking
station
was
still
undergoing
repair,
so
I
descended
at
Byfleet
station
and
took
the
road
to
Maybury,
past
the
place
where
I
and
the
artilleryman
had
talked
to
the
hussars,
and
on
by
the
spot
where
the
Martian
had
appeared
to
me
in
the
thunderstorm.
Here,
moved
by
curiosity,
I
turned
aside
to
find,
among
a
tangle
of
red
fronds,
the
warped
and
broken
dog
cart
with
the
whitened
bones
of
the
horse
scattered
and
gnawed.
For
a
time
I
stood
regarding
these
vestiges.
.
.
.
Then
I
returned
through
the
pine
wood,
neck-high
with
red
weed
here
and
there,
to
find
the
landlord
of
the
Spotted
Dog
had
already
found
burial,
and
so
came
home
past
the
College
Arms.
A
man
standing
at
an
open
cottage
door
greeted
me
by
name
as
I
passed.
I
looked
at
my
house
with
a
quick
flash
of
hope
that
faded
immediately.
The
door
had
been
forced;
it
was
unfast
and
was
opening
slowly
as
I
approached.
It
slammed
again.
The
curtains
of
my
study
fluttered
out
of
the
open
window
from
which
I
and
the
artilleryman
had
watched
the
dawn.
No
one
had
closed
it
since.
The
smashed
bushes
were
just
as
I
had
left
them
nearly
four
weeks
ago.
I
stumbled
into
the
hall,
and
the
house
felt
empty.
The
stair
carpet
was
ruffled
and
discoloured
where
I
had
crouched,
soaked
to
the
skin
from
the
thunderstorm
the
night
of
the
catastrophe.
Our
muddy
footsteps
I
saw
still
went
up
the
stairs.
I
followed
them
to
my
study,
and
found
lying
on
my
writing-table
still,
with
the
selenite
paper
weight
upon
it,
the
sheet
of
work
I
had
left
on
the
afternoon
of
the
opening
of
the
cylinder.
For
a
space
I
stood
reading
over
my
abandoned
arguments.
It
was
a
paper
on
the
probable
development
of
Moral
Ideas
with
the
development
of
the
civilising
process;
and
the
last
sentence
was
the
opening
of
a
prophecy:
"In
about
two
hundred
years,"
I
had
written,
"we
may
expect----"
The
sentence
ended
abruptly.
I
remembered
my
inability
to
fix
my
mind
that
morning,
scarcely
a
month
gone
by,
and
how
I
had
broken
off
to
get
my
_Daily
Chronicle_
from
the
newsboy.
I
remembered
how
I
went
down
to
the
garden
gate
as
he
came
along,
and
how
I
had
listened
to
his
odd
story
of
"Men
from
Mars."
I
came
down
and
went
into
the
dining
room.
There
were
the
mutton
and
the
bread,
both
far
gone
now
in
decay,
and
a
beer
bottle
overturned,
just
as
I
and
the
artilleryman
had
left
them.
My
home
was
desolate.
I
perceived
the
folly
of
the
faint
hope
I
had
cherished
so
long.
And
then
a
strange
thing
occurred.
"It
is
no
use,"
said
a
voice.
"The
house
is
deserted.
No
one
has
been
here
these
ten
days.
Do
not
stay
here
to
torment
yourself.
No
one
escaped
but
you."
I
was
startled.
Had
I
spoken
my
thought
aloud?
I
turned,
and
the
French
window
was
open
behind
me.
I
made
a
step
to
it,
and
stood
looking
out.
And
there,
amazed
and
afraid,
even
as
I
stood
amazed
and
afraid,
were
my
cousin
and
my
wife--my
wife
white
and
tearless.
She
gave
a
faint
cry.
"I
came,"
she
said.
"I
knew--knew----"
She
put
her
hand
to
her
throat--swayed.
I
made
a
step
forward,
and
caught
her
in
my
arms.
CHAPTER
TEN
THE
EPILOGUE
I
cannot
but
regret,
now
that
I
am
concluding
my
story,
how
little
I
am
able
to
contribute
to
the
discussion
of
the
many
debatable
questions
which
are
still
unsettled.
In
one
respect
I
shall
certainly
provoke
criticism.
My
particular
province
is
speculative
philosophy.
My
knowledge
of
comparative
physiology
is
confined
to
a
book
or
two,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
Carver's
suggestions
as
to
the
reason
of
the
rapid
death
of
the
Martians
is
so
probable
as
to
be
regarded
almost
as
a
proven
conclusion.
I
have
assumed
that
in
the
body
of
my
narrative.
At
any
rate,
in
all
the
bodies
of
the
Martians
that
were
examined
after
the
war,
no
bacteria
except
those
already
known
as
terrestrial
species
were
found.
That
they
did
not
bury
any
of
their
dead,
and
the
reckless
slaughter
they
perpetrated,
point
also
to
an
entire
ignorance
of
the
putrefactive
process.
But
probable
as
this
seems,
it
is
by
no
means
a
proven
conclusion.
Neither
is
the
composition
of
the
Black
Smoke
known,
which
the
Martians
used
with
such
deadly
effect,
and
the
generator
of
the
Heat-Rays
remains
a
puzzle.
The
terrible
disasters
at
the
Ealing
and
South
Kensington
laboratories
have
disinclined
analysts
for
further
investigations
upon
the
latter.
Spectrum
analysis
of
the
black
powder
points
unmistakably
to
the
presence
of
an
unknown
element
with
a
brilliant
group
of
three
lines
in
the
green,
and
it
is
possible
that
it
combines
with
argon
to
form
a
compound
which
acts
at
once
with
deadly
effect
upon
some
constituent
in
the
blood.
But
such
unproven
speculations
will
scarcely
be
of
interest
to
the
general
reader,
to
whom
this
story
is
addressed.
None
of
the
brown
scum
that
drifted
down
the
Thames
after
the
destruction
of
Shepperton
was
examined
at
the
time,
and
now
none
is
forthcoming.
The
results
of
an
anatomical
examination
of
the
Martians,
so
far
as
the
prowling
dogs
had
left
such
an
examination
possible,
I
have
already
given.
But
everyone
is
familiar
with
the
magnificent
and
almost
complete
specimen
in
spirits
at
the
Natural
History
Museum,
and
the
countless
drawings
that
have
been
made
from
it;
and
beyond
that
the
interest
of
their
physiology
and
structure
is
purely
scientific.
A
question
of
graver
and
universal
interest
is
the
possibility
of
another
attack
from
the
Martians.
I
do
not
think
that
nearly
enough
attention
is
being
given
to
this
aspect
of
the
matter.
At
present
the
planet
Mars
is
in
conjunction,
but
with
every
return
to
opposition
I,
for
one,
anticipate
a
renewal
of
their
adventure.
In
any
case,
we
should
be
prepared.
It
seems
to
me
that
it
should
be
possible
to
define
the
position
of
the
gun
from
which
the
shots
are
discharged,
to
keep
a
sustained
watch
upon
this
part
of
the
planet,
and
to
anticipate
the
arrival
of
the
next
attack.
In
that
case
the
cylinder
might
be
destroyed
with
dynamite
or
artillery
before
it
was
sufficiently
cool
for
the
Martians
to
emerge,
or
they
might
be
butchered
by
means
of
guns
so
soon
as
the
screw
opened.
It
seems
to
me
that
they
have
lost
a
vast
advantage
in
the
failure
of
their
first
surprise.
Possibly
they
see
it
in
the
same
light.
Lessing
has
advanced
excellent
reasons
for
supposing
that
the
Martians
have
actually
succeeded
in
effecting
a
landing
on
the
planet
Venus.
Seven
months
ago
now,
Venus
and
Mars
were
in
alignment
with
the
sun;
that
is
to
say,
Mars
was
in
opposition
from
the
point
of
view
of
an
observer
on
Venus.
Subsequently
a
peculiar
luminous
and
sinuous
marking
appeared
on
the
unillumined
half
of
the
inner
planet,
and
almost
simultaneously
a
faint
dark
mark
of
a
similar
sinuous
character
was
detected
upon
a
photograph
of
the
Martian
disk.
One
needs
to
see
the
drawings
of
these
appearances
in
order
to
appreciate
fully
their
remarkable
resemblance
in
character.
At
any
rate,
whether
we
expect
another
invasion
or
not,
our
views
of
the
human
future
must
be
greatly
modified
by
these
events.
We
have
learned
now
that
we
cannot
regard
this
planet
as
being
fenced
in
and
a
secure
abiding
place
for
Man;
we
can
never
anticipate
the
unseen
good
or
evil
that
may
come
upon
us
suddenly
out
of
space.
It
may
be
that
in
the
larger
design
of
the
universe
this
invasion
from
Mars
is
not
without
its
ultimate
benefit
for
men;
it
has
robbed
us
of
that
serene
confidence
in
the
future
which
is
the
most
fruitful
source
of
decadence,
the
gifts
to
human
science
it
has
brought
are
enormous,
and
it
has
done
much
to
promote
the
conception
of
the
commonweal
of
mankind.
It
may
be
that
across
the
immensity
of
space
the
Martians
have
watched
the
fate
of
these
pioneers
of
theirs
and
learned
their
lesson,
and
that
on
the
planet
Venus
they
have
found
a
securer
settlement.
Be
that
as
it
may,
for
many
years
yet
there
will
certainly
be
no
relaxation
of
the
eager
scrutiny
of
the
Martian
disk,
and
those
fiery
darts
of
the
sky,
the
shooting
stars,
will
bring
with
them
as
they
fall
an
unavoidable
apprehension
to
all
the
sons
of
men.
The
broadening
of
men's
views
that
has
resulted
can
scarcely
be
exaggerated.
Before
the
cylinder
fell
there
was
a
general
persuasion
that
through
all
the
deep
of
space
no
life
existed
beyond
the
petty
surface
of
our
minute
sphere.
Now
we
see
further.
If
the
Martians
can
reach
Venus,
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
thing
is
impossible
for
men,
and
when
the
slow
cooling
of
the
sun
makes
this
earth
uninhabitable,
as
at
last
it
must
do,
it
may
be
that
the
thread
of
life
that
has
begun
here
will
have
streamed
out
and
caught
our
sister
planet
within
its
toils.
Dim
and
wonderful
is
the
vision
I
have
conjured
up
in
my
mind
of
life
spreading
slowly
from
this
little
seed
bed
of
the
solar
system
throughout
the
inanimate
vastness
of
sidereal
space.
But
that
is
a
remote
dream.
It
may
be,
on
the
other
hand,
that
the
destruction
of
the
Martians
is
only
a
reprieve.
To
them,
and
not
to
us,
perhaps,
is
the
future
ordained.
I
must
confess
the
stress
and
danger
of
the
time
have
left
an
abiding
sense
of
doubt
and
insecurity
in
my
mind.
I
sit
in
my
study
writing
by
lamplight,
and
suddenly
I
see
again
the
healing
valley
below
set
with
writhing
flames,
and
feel
the
house
behind
and
about
me
empty
and
desolate.
I
go
out
into
the
Byfleet
Road,
and
vehicles
pass
me,
a
butcher
boy
in
a
cart,
a
cabful
of
visitors,
a
workman
on
a
bicycle,
children
going
to
school,
and
suddenly
they
become
vague
and
unreal,
and
I
hurry
again
with
the
artilleryman
through
the
hot,
brooding
silence.
Of
a
night
I
see
the
black
powder
darkening
the
silent
streets,
and
the
contorted
bodies
shrouded
in
that
layer;
they
rise
upon
me
tattered
and
dog-bitten.
They
gibber
and
grow
fiercer,
paler,
uglier,
mad
distortions
of
humanity
at
last,
and
I
wake,
cold
and
wretched,
in
the
darkness
of
the
night.
I
go
to
London
and
see
the
busy
multitudes
in
Fleet
Street
and
the
Strand,
and
it
comes
across
my
mind
that
they
are
but
the
ghosts
of
the
past,
haunting
the
streets
that
I
have
seen
silent
and
wretched,
going
to
and
fro,
phantasms
in
a
dead
city,
the
mockery
of
life
in
a
galvanised
body.
And
strange,
too,
it
is
to
stand
on
Primrose
Hill,
as
I
did
but
a
day
before
writing
this
last
chapter,
to
see
the
great
province
of
houses,
dim
and
blue
through
the
haze
of
the
smoke
and
mist,
vanishing
at
last
into
the
vague
lower
sky,
to
see
the
people
walking
to
and
fro
among
the
flower
beds
on
the
hill,
to
see
the
sight-seers
about
the
Martian
machine
that
stands
there
still,
to
hear
the
tumult
of
playing
children,
and
to
recall
the
time
when
I
saw
it
all
bright
and
clear-cut,
hard
and
silent,
under
the
dawn
of
that
last
great
day.
.
.
.
And
strangest
of
all
is
it
to
hold
my
wife's
hand
again,
and
to
think
that
I
have
counted
her,
and
that
she
has
counted
me,
among
the
dead.
